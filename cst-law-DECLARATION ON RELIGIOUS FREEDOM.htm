      HUMANAE</FONT></I></B> <BR>ON THE RIGHT OF THE PERSON AND OF COMMUNITIES 
      <BR>TO SOCIAL AND CIVIL FREEDOM IN MATTERS RELIGIOUS <BR>PROMULGATED BY 
      HIS HOLINESS<BR>POPE PAUL VI <BR>ON DECEMBER 7, 1965 </P></CENTER>
      <P>1. A sense of the dignity of the human person has been impressing 
      itself more and more deeply on the consciousness of contemporary man,(1) 
      and the demand is increasingly made that men should act on their own 
      judgment, enjoying and making use of a responsible freedom, not driven by 
      coercion but motivated by a sense of duty. The demand is likewise made 
      that constitutional limits should be set to the powers of government, in 
      order that there may be no encroachment on the rightful freedom of the 
      person and of associations. This demand for freedom in human society 
      chiefly regards the quest for the values proper to the human spirit. It 
      regards, in the first place, the free exercise of religion in society. 
      This Vatican Council takes careful note of these desires in the minds of 
      men. It proposes to declare them to be greatly in accord with truth and 
      justice. To this end, it searches into the sacred tradition and doctrine 
      of the Church-the treasury out of which the Church continually brings 
      forth new things that are in harmony with the things that are old. </P>
      <P>First, the council professes its belief that God Himself has made known 
      to mankind the way in which men are to serve Him, and thus be saved in 
      Christ and come to blessedness. We believe that this one true religion 
      subsists in the Catholic and Apostolic Church, to which the Lord Jesus 
      committed the duty of spreading it abroad among all men. Thus He spoke to 
      the Apostles: "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing 
      them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
      teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined upon you" 
      (Matt. 28: 19-20). On their part, all men are bound to seek the truth, 
      especially in what concerns God and His Church, and to embrace the truth 
      they come to know, and to hold fast to it.</P>
      <P>This Vatican Council likewise professes its belief that it is upon the 
      human conscience that these obligations fall and exert their binding 
      force. The truth cannot impose itself except by virtue of its own truth, 
      as it makes its entrance into the mind at once quietly and with power.</P>
      <P>Religious freedom, in turn, which men demand as necessary to fulfill 
      their duty to worship God, has to do with immunity from coercion in civil 
      society. Therefore it leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on 
      the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward 
      the one Church of Christ.</P>
      <P>Over and above all this, the council intends to develop the doctrine of 
      recent popes on the inviolable rights of the human person and the 
      constitutional order of society.</P>
      <P>2. This Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to 
      religious freedom. This freedom means that all men are to be immune from 
      coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human 
      power, in such wise that no one is to be forced to act in a manner 
      contrary to his own beliefs, whether privately or publicly, whether alone 
      or in association with others, within due limits.</P>
      <P>The council further declares that the right to religious freedom has 
      its foundation in the very dignity of the human person as this dignity is 
      known through the revealed word of God and by reason itself.(2) This right 
      of the human person to religious freedom is to be recognized in the 
      constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a 
      civil right.</P>
      <P>It is in accordance with their dignity as persons-that is, beings 
      endowed with reason and free will and therefore privileged to bear 
      personal responsibility-that all men should be at once impelled by nature 
      and also bound by a moral obligation to seek the truth, especially 
      religious truth. They are also bound to adhere to the truth, once it is 
      known, and to order their whole lives in accord with the demands of truth 
      However, men cannot discharge these obligations in a manner in keeping 
      with their own nature unless they enjoy immunity from external coercion as 
      well as psychological freedom. Therefore the right to religious freedom 
      has its foundation not in the subjective disposition of the person, but in 
      his very nature. In consequence, the right to this immunity continues to 
      exist even in those who do not live up to their obligation of seeking the 
      truth and adhering to it and the exercise of this right is not to be 
      impeded, provided that just public order be observed.</P>
      <P>3. Further light is shed on the subject if one considers that the 
      highest norm of human life is the divine law-eternal, objective and 
      universal-whereby God orders, directs and governs the entire universe and 
      all the ways of the human community by a plan conceived in wisdom and 
      love. Man has been made by God to participate in this law, with the result 
      that, under the gentle disposition of divine Providence, he can come to 
      perceive ever more fully the truth that is unchanging. Wherefore every man 
      has the duty, and therefore the right, to seek the truth in matters 
      religious in order that he may with prudence form for himself right and 
      true judgments of conscience, under use of all suitable means.</P>
      <P>Truth, however, is to be sought after in a manner proper to the dignity 
      of the human person and his social nature. The inquiry is to be free, 
      carried on with the aid of teaching or instruction, communication and 
      dialogue, in the course of which men explain to one another the truth they 
      have discovered, or think they have discovered, in order thus to assist 
      one another in the quest for truth.</P>
      <P>Moreover, as the truth is discovered, it is by a personal assent that 
      men are to adhere to it.</P>
      <P>On his part, man perceives and acknowledges the imperatives of the 
      divine law through the mediation of conscience. In all his activity a man 
      is bound to follow his conscience in order that he may come to God, the 
      end and purpose of life. It follows that he is not to be forced to act in 
      manner contrary to his conscience. Nor, on the other hand, is he to be 
      restrained from acting in accordance with his conscience, especially in 
      matters religious. The reason is that the exercise of religion, of its 
      very nature, consists before all else in those internal, voluntary and 
      free acts whereby man sets the course of his life directly toward God. No 
      merely human power can either command or prohibit acts of this kind.(3) 
      The social nature of man, however, itself requires that he should give 
      external expression to his internal acts of religion: that he should share 
      with others in matters religious; that he should profess his religion in 
      community. Injury therefore is done to the human person and to the very 
      order established by God for human life, if the free exercise of religion 
      is denied in society, provided just public order is observed.</P>
      <P>There is a further consideration. The religious acts whereby men, in 
      private and in public and out of a sense of personal conviction, direct 
      their lives to God transcend by their very nature the order of terrestrial 
      and temporal affairs. Government therefore ought indeed to take account of 
      the religious life of the citizenry and show it favor, since the function 
      of government is to make provision for the common welfare. However, it 
      would clearly transgress the limits set to its power, were it to presume 
      to command or inhibit acts that are religious.</P>
      <P>4. The freedom or immunity from coercion in matters religious which is 
      the endowment of persons as individuals is also to be recognized as their 
      right when they act in community. Religious communities are a requirement 
      of the social nature both of man and of religion itself.</P>
      <P>Provided the just demands of public order are observed, religious 
      communities rightfully claim freedom in order that they may govern 
      themselves according to their own norms, honor the Supreme Being in public 
      worship, assist their members in the practice of the religious life, 
      strengthen them by instruction, and promote institutions in which they may 
      join together for the purpose of ordering their own lives in accordance 
      with their religious principles.</P>
      <P>Religious communities also have the right not to be hindered, either by 
      legal measures or by administrative action on the part of government, in 
      the selection, training, appointment, and transferral of their own 
      ministers, in communicating with religious authorities and communities 
      abroad, in erecting buildings for religious purposes, and in the 
      acquisition and use of suitable funds or properties.</P>
      <P>Religious communities also have the right not to be hindered in their 
      public teaching and witness to their faith, whether by the spoken or by 
      the written word. However, in spreading religious faith and in introducing 
      religious practices everyone ought at all times to refrain from any manner 
      of action which might seem to carry a hint of coercion or of a kind of 
      persuasion that would be dishonorable or unworthy, especially when dealing 
      with poor or uneducated people. Such a manner of action would have to be 
      considered an abuse of one's right and a violation of the right of others. 
      </P>
      <P>In addition, it comes within the meaning of religious freedom that 
      religious communities should not be prohibited from freely undertaking to 
      show the special value of their doctrine in what concerns the organization 
      of society and the inspiration of the whole of human activity. Finally, 
      the social nature of man and the very nature of religion afford the 
      foundation of the right of men freely to hold meetings and to establish 
      educational, cultural, charitable and social organizations, under the 
      impulse of their own religious sense.</P>
      <P>5. The family, since it is a society in its own original right, has the 
      right freely to live its own domestic religious life under the guidance of 
      parents. Parents, moreover, have the right to determine, in accordance 
      with their own religious beliefs, the kind of religious education that 
      their children are to receive. Government, in consequence, must 
      acknowledge the right of parents to make a genuinely free choice of 
      schools and of other means of education, and the use of this freedom of 
      choice is not to be made a reason for imposing unjust burdens on parents, 
      whether directly or indirectly. Besides, the right of parents are 
      violated, if their children are forced to attend lessons or instructions 
      which are not in agreement with their religious beliefs, or if a single 
      system of education, from which all religious formation is excluded, is 
      imposed upon all. </P>
      <P>6. Since the common welfare of society consists in the entirety of 
      those conditions of social life under which men enjoy the possibility of 
      achieving their own perfection in a certain fullness of measure and also 
      with some relative ease, it chiefly consists in the protection of the 
      rights, and in the performance of the duties, of the human person.(4) 
      Therefore the care of the right to religious freedom devolves upon the 
      whole citizenry, upon social groups, upon government, and upon the Church 
      and other religious communities, in virtue of the duty of all toward the 
      common welfare, and in the manner proper to each.</P>
      <P>The protection and promotion of the inviolable rights of man ranks 
      among the essential duties of government.(5) Therefore government is to 
      assume the safeguard of the religious freedom of all its citizens, in an 
      effective manner, by just laws and by other appropriate means.</P>
      <P>Government is also to help create conditions favorable to the fostering 
      of religious life, in order that the people may be truly enabled to 
      exercise their religious rights and to fulfill their religious duties, and 
      also in order that society itself may profit by the moral qualities of 
      justice and peace which have their origin in men's faithfulness to God and 
      to His holy will. (6)</P>
      <P>If, in view of peculiar circumstances obtaining among peoples, special 
      civil recognition is given to one religious community in the 
      constitutional order of society, it is at the same time imperative that 
      the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious freedom 
      should be recognized and made effective in practice.</P>
      <P>Finally, government is to see to it that equality of citizens before 
      the law, which is itself an element of the common good, is never violated, 
      whether openly or covertly, for religious reasons. Nor is there to be 
      discrimination among citizens.</P>
      <P>It follows that a wrong is done when government imposes upon its 
      people, by force or fear or other means, the profession or repudiation of 
      any religion, or when it hinders men from joining or leaving a religious 
      community. All the more is it a violation of the will of God and of the 
      sacred rights of the person and the family of nations when force is 
      brought to bear in any way in order to destroy or repress religion, either 
      in the whole of mankind or in a particular country or in a definite 
      community.</P>
      <P>7. The right to religious freedom is exercised in human society: hence 
      its exercise is subject to certain regulatory norms. In the use of all 
      freedoms the moral principle of personal and social responsibility is to 
      be observed. In the exercise of their rights, individual men and social 
      groups are bound by the moral law to have respect both for the rights of 
      others and for their own duties toward others and for the common welfare 
      of all. Men are to deal with their fellows in justice and civility.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, society has the right to defend itself against possible 
      abuses committed on the pretext of freedom of religion. It is the special 
      duty of government to provide this protection. However, government is not 
      to act in an arbitrary fashion or in an unfair spirit of partisanship. Its 
      action is to be controlled by juridical norms which are in conformity with 
      the objective moral order. These norms arise out of the need for the 
      effective safeguard of the rights of all citizens and for the peaceful 
      settlement of conflicts of rights, also out of the need for an adequate 
      care of genuine public peace, which comes about when men live together in 
      good order and in true justice, and finally out of the need for a proper 
      guardianship of public morality. </P>
      <P>These matters constitute the basic component of the common welfare: 
      they are what is meant by public order. For the rest, the usages of 
      society are to be the usages of freedom in their full range: that is, the 
      freedom of man is to be respected as far as possible and is not to be 
      curtailed except when and insofar as necessary.</P>
      <P>8. Many pressures are brought to bear upon the men of our day, to the 
      point where the danger arises lest they lose the possibility of acting on 
      their own judgment. On the other hand, not a few can be found who seem 
      inclined to use the name of freedom as the pretext for refusing to submit 
      to authority and for making light of the duty of obedience. Wherefore this 
      Vatican Council urges everyone, especially those who are charged with the 
      task of educating others, to do their utmost to form men who, on the one 
      hand, will respect the moral order and be obedient to lawful authority, 
      and on the other hand, will be lovers of true freedom-men, in other words, 
      who will come to decisions on their own judgment and in the light of 
      truth, govern their activities with a sense of responsibility, and strive 
      after what is true and right, willing always to join with others in 
      cooperative effort.</P>
      <P>Religious freedom therefore ought to have this further purpose and aim, 
      namely, that men may come to act with greater responsibility in fulfilling 
      their duties in community life.</P>
      <P>9. The declaration of this Vatican Council on the right of man to 
      religious freedom has its foundation in the dignity of the person, whose 
      exigencies have come to be are fully known to human reason through 
      centuries of experience. What is more, this doctrine of freedom has roots 
      in divine revelation, and for this reason Christians are bound to respect 
      it all the more conscientiously. Revelation does not indeed affirm in so 
      many words the right of man to immunity from external coercion in matters 
      religious. It does, however, disclose the dignity of the human person in 
      its full dimensions. It gives evidence of the respect which Christ showed 
      toward the freedom with which man is to fulfill his duty of belief in the 
      word of God and it gives us lessons in the spirit which disciples of such 
      a Master ought to adopt and continually follow. Thus further light is cast 
      upon the general principles upon which the doctrine of this declaration on 
      religious freedom is based. In particular, religious freedom in society is 
      entirely consonant with the freedom of the act of Christian faith.</P>
      <P>10. It is one of the major tenets of Catholic doctrine that man's 
      response to God in faith must be free: no one therefore is to be forced to 
      embrace the Christian faith against his own will.(8) This doctrine is 
      contained in the word of God and it was constantly proclaimed by the 
      Fathers of the Church.(7) The act of faith is of its very nature a free 
      act. Man, redeemed by Christ the Savior and through Christ Jesus called to 
      be God's adopted son,(9) cannot give his adherence to God revealing 
      Himself unless, under the drawing of the Father,(10) he offers to God the 
      reasonable and free submission of faith. It is therefore completely in 
      accord with the nature of faith that in matters religious every manner of 
      coercion on the part of men should be excluded. In consequence, the 
      principle of religious freedom makes no small contribution to the creation 
      of an environment in which men can without hindrance be invited to the 
      Christian faith, embrace it of their own free will, and profess it 
      effectively in their whole manner of life.</P>
      <P>11. God calls men to serve Him in spirit and in truth, hence they are 
      bound in conscience but they stand under no compulsion. God has regard for 
      the dignity of the human person whom He Himself created and man is to be 
      guided by his own judgment and he is to enjoy freedom. This truth appears 
      at its height in Christ Jesus, in whom God manifested Himself and His ways 
      with men. Christ is at once our Master and our Lord(11) and also meek and 
      humble of heart.(12) In attracting and inviting His disciples He used 
      patience.(13) He wrought miracles to illuminate His teaching and to 
      establish its truth, but His intention was to rouse faith in His hearers 
      and to confirm them in faith, not to exert coercion upon them.(14) He did 
      indeed denounce the unbelief of some who listened to Him, but He left 
      vengeance to God in expectation of the day of judgment.(15) When He sent 
      His Apostles into the world, He said to them: "He who believes and is 
      baptized will be saved. He who does not believe will be condemned" (Mark 
      16:16). But He Himself, noting that the cockle had been sown amid the 
      wheat, gave orders that both should be allowed to grow until the harvest 
      time, which will come at the end of the world.(16) He refused to be a 
      political messiah, ruling by force:(17) He preferred to call Himself the 
      Son of Man, who came "to serve and to give his life as a ransom for the 
      many" (Mark 10:45). He showed Himself the perfect servant of God,(18) who 
      "does not break the bruised reed nor extinguish the smoking flax" (Matt. 
      12:20).</P>
      <P>He acknowledged the power of government and its rights, when He 
      commanded that tribute be given to Caesar: but He gave clear warning that 
      the higher rights of God are to be kept inviolate: "Render to Caesar the 
      things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's" (Matt. 
      22:21). In the end, when He completed on the cross the work of redemption 
      whereby He achieved salvation and true freedom for men, He brought His 
      revelation to completion. For He bore witness to the truth,(19) but He 
      refused to impose the truth by force on those who spoke against it. Not by 
      force of blows does His rule assert its claims.(20) It is established by 
      witnessing to the truth and by hearing the truth, and it extends its 
      dominion by the love whereby Christ, lifted up on the cross, draws all men 
      to Himself.(21)</P>
      <P>Taught by the word and example of Christ, the Apostles followed the 
      same way. From the very origins of the Church the disciples of Christ 
      strove to convert men to faith in Christ as the Lord; not, however, by the 
      use of coercion or of devices unworthy of the Gospel, but by the power, 
      above all, of the word of God.(22) Steadfastly they proclaimed to all the 
      plan of God our Savior, "who wills that all men should be saved and come 
      to the acknowledgment of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:4). At the same time, 
      however, they showed respect for those of weaker stuff, even though they 
      were in error, and thus they made it plain that "each one of us is to 
      render to God an account of himself" (Romans 14:12),(23) and for that 
      reason is bound to obey his conscience. Like Christ Himself, the Apostles 
      were unceasingly bent upon bearing witness to the truth of God, and they 
      showed the fullest measure of boldness in "speaking the word with 
      confidence" (Acts 4:31) (24) before the people and their rulers. With a 
      firm faith they held that the Gospel is indeed the power of God unto 
      salvation for all who believe.(25) Therefore they rejected all "carnal 
      weapons:(26) they followed the example of the gentleness and 
      respectfulness of Christ and they preached the word of God in the full 
      confidence that there was resident in this word itself a divine power able 
      to destroy all the forces arrayed against God(27) and bring men to faith 
      in Christ and to His service.(28) As the Master, so too the Apostles 
      recognized legitimate civil authority. "For there is no power except from 
      God," the Apostle teaches, and thereafter commands: "Let everyone be 
      subject to higher authorities.... He who resists authority resists God's 
      ordinance" (Romans 13:1-5).(29) At the same time, however, they did not 
      hesitate to speak out against governing powers which set themselves in 
      opposition to the holy will of God: "It is necessary to obey God rather 
      than men" (Acts 5:29).(30) This is the way along which the martyrs and 
      other faithful have walked through all ages and over all the earth.</P>
      <P>12. In faithfulness therefore to the truth of the Gospel, the Church is 
      following the way of Christ and the apostles when she recognizes and gives 
      support to the principle of religious freedom as befitting the dignity of 
      man and as being in accord with divine revelation. Throughout the ages the 
      Church has kept safe and handed on the doctrine received from the Master 
      and from the apostles. In the life of the People of God, as it has made 
      its pilgrim way through the vicissitudes of human history, there has at 
      times appeared a way of acting that was hardly in accord with the spirit 
      of the Gospel or even opposed to it. Nevertheless, the doctrine of the 
      Church that no one is to be coerced into faith has always stood firm.</P>
      <P>Thus the leaven of the Gospel has long been about its quiet work in the 
      minds of men, and to it is due in great measure the fact that in the 
      course of time men have come more widely to recognize their dignity as 
      persons, and the conviction has grown stronger that the person in society 
      is to be kept free from all manner of coercion in matters religious.</P>
      <P>13. Among the things that concern the good of the Church and indeed the 
      welfare of society here on earth-things therefore that are always and 
      everywhere to be kept secure and defended against all injury-this 
      certainly is preeminent, namely, that the Church should enjoy that full 
      measure of freedom which her care for the salvation of men requires.(31) 
      This is a sacred freedom, because the only-begotten Son endowed with it 
      the Church which He purchased with His blood. Indeed it is so much the 
      property of the Church that to act against it is to act against the will 
      of God. The freedom of the Church is the fundamental principle in what 
      concerns the relations between the Church and governments and the whole 
      civil order.</P>
      <P>In human society and in the face of government the Church claims 
      freedom for herself in her character as a spiritual authority, established 
      by Christ the Lord, upon which there rests, by divine mandate, the duty of 
      going out into the whole world and preaching the Gospel to every 
      creature.(32) The Church also claims freedom for herself in her character 
      as a society of men who have the right to live in society in accordance 
      with the precepts of the Christian faith.(33)</P>
      <P>In turn, where the principle of religious freedom is not only 
      proclaimed in words or simply incorporated in law but also given sincere 
      and practical application, there the Church succeeds in achieving a stable 
      situation of right as well as of fact and the independence which is 
      necessary for the fulfillment of her divine mission.</P>
      <P>This independence is precisely what the authorities of the Church claim 
      in society.(34) At the same time, the Christian faithful, in common with 
      all other men, possess the civil right not to be hindered in leading their 
      lives in accordance with their consciences. Therefore, a harmony exists 
      between the freedom of the Church and the religious freedom which is to be 
      recognized as the right of all men and communities and sanctioned by 
      constitutional law. </P>
      <P>14. In order to be faithful to the divine command, "teach all nations" 
      (Matt. 28:19-20), the Catholic Church must work with all urgency and 
      concern "that the word of God be spread abroad and glorified" (2 Thess. 
      3:1). Hence the Church earnestly begs of its children that, "first of all, 
      supplications, prayers, petitions, acts of thanksgiving be made for all 
      men.... For this is good and agreeable in the sight of God our Savior, who 
      wills that all men be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 
      Tim. 2:1-4). In the formation of their consciences, the Christian faithful 
      ought carefully to attend to the sacred and certain doctrine of the 
      Church.(35) For the Church is, by the will of Christ, the teacher of the 
      truth. It is her duty to give utterance to, and authoritatively to teach, 
      that truth which is Christ Himself, and also to declare and confirm by her 
      authority those principles of the moral order which have their origins in 
      human nature itself. Furthermore, let Christians walk in wisdom in the 
      face of those outside, "in the Holy Spirit, in unaffected love, in the 
      word of truth" (2 Cor. 6:6-7), and let them be about their task of 
      spreading the light of life with all confidence(36) and apostolic courage, 
      even to the shedding of their blood.</P>
      <P>The disciple is bound by a grave obligation toward Christ, his Master, 
      ever more fully to understand the truth received from Him, faithfully to 
      proclaim it, and vigorously to defend it, never-be it understood-having 
      recourse to means that are incompatible with the spirit of the Gospel. At 
      the same time, the charity of Christ urges him to love and have prudence 
      and patience in his dealings with those who are in error or in ignorance 
      with regard to the faith.(37) All is to be taken into account-the 
      Christian duty to Christ, the life-giving word which must be proclaimed, 
      the rights of the human person, and the measure of grace granted by God 
      through Christ to men who are invited freely to accept and profess the 
      faith.</P>
      <P>15. The fact is that men of the present day want to be able freely to 
      profess their religion in private and in public. Indeed, religious freedom 
      has already been declared to be a civil right in most constitutions, and 
      it is solemnly recognized in international documents.(38) The further fact 
      is that forms of government still exist under which, even though freedom 
      of religious worship receives constitutional recognition, the powers of 
      government are engaged in the effort to deter citizens from the profession 
      of religion and to make life very difficult and dangerous for religious 
      communities.</P>
      <P>This council greets with joy the first of these two facts as among the 
      signs of the times. With sorrow, however, it denounces the other fact, as 
      only to be deplored. The council exhorts Catholics, and it directs a plea 
      to all men, most carefully to consider how greatly necessary religious 
      freedom is, especially in the present condition of the human family. All 
      nations are coming into even closer unity. Men of different cultures and 
      religions are being brought together in closer relationships. There is a 
      growing consciousness of the personal responsibility that every man has. 
      All this is evident. Consequently, in order that relationships of peace 
      and harmony be established and maintained within the whole of mankind, it 
      is necessary that religious freedom be everywhere provided with an 
      effective constitutional guarantee and that respect be shown for the high 
      duty and right of man freely to lead his religious life in society.</P>
      <P>May the God and Father of all grant that the human family, through 
      careful observance of the principle of religious freedom in society, may 
      be brought by the grace of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit to the 
      sublime and unending and "glorious freedom of the sons of God" (Rom. 
      8:21).</P>
