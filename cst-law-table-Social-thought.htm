<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Abstract: </b>After a brief survey 
of Catholic social teaching, Baum draws a strong parallel between Pope John Paul II’s 
encyclicals and Karl Marx’s early manuscripts, noting their apparent agreement on universal 
solidarity. Baum asserts that papal teaching &quot;recognizes that capitalism has become a global 
economic system…with centers of power in North America, Western Europe, and East 
Asia.&quot; Baum contrasts Catholic and Marxist theory by explicating the ethical dimensions 
of Catholic social theory. </p>

look at various papal documents on social teaching and suggests that some of the earlier 
ones would have benefited greatly from a more interdisciplinary approach. Bayer’s 
premise is that the main cause of economic misery is the domination of capital over labor. 
He suggests that economic justice can only be achieved if the discussion includes a 
thorough look at labor income. </p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Abstract: </b>Using the studies of 
Martin Luther King as a backdrop, Beckley seeks to compare and contrast the concepts of 
social justice espoused by three famous Christian ethicists: Walter Rauschenbusch, 
Reinhold Niebuhr and Monsignor John Augustine Ryan. The development and influence 
of the writings of Rauschenbusch, Ryan, and Niebuhr are described individually 
and the author attempts to show the similarities and disparities between their theories. 
Beckley demonstrates that their legacies can be applied to current thinking about justice.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Abstract: </b>Boxx argues that 
social order comprises the collective sense of the norms and values of the people. These are 
themselves rooted in the interaction of beliefs and practices of society, and at the

could be applied to help restore the connection between morality and social order. He 
concludes by stating that empowerment, liberty and individual responsibility are 
cornerstones of social governance. </p>
