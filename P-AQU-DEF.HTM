<P class="auto-style1"><B>Socrates (c. 470-399BC): The one who rescued western philosophy from a
premature death by switching the focus of philosophy from questions of
metaphysics and the world to questions of morality and true wisdom. His
methodology was one of asking questions. Condemned to die because he would
not abandon doing philosophy in Athens. </B><BR wp="br1">
</P>
<P class="auto-style1"><B>Plato (428-348BC): The student of Socrates who sought to
incorporate the ethical concerns of Socrates into a dualistic view of the
world, knowledge and self. Famous for his images of the Divided Line and
The Cave. Founded substance dualism.<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
Aristotle: (384-322BC): The student of Plato who disagreed with substance dualism
and sought to preserve Plato's insights that existence can be twofold (formal 
and material), that the soul is immaterial and immortal. Established 
hylomorphism.
<BR wp="br1">

Aquinas (1225-1274): An Italian philosopher renowed for his humility and
wisdom. Called the Angelic Doctor for his descriptions of angels. Famous

Avicenna (980-1037): Influential Arabic philosopher teaching that it is
a separate divine intellect that makes human thought possible. <BR wp="br1">
