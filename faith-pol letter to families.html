<br>
<i>Dear Families!</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">1. The celebration of the Year of the
Family gives me a welcome opportunity
to knock at the door of your home, eager to greet you with deep
affection
and to spend time with you. I do so by this Letter, taking as my point
of departure the words of the Encyclical <i>Redemptor Hominis, </i>published
in the first days of my ministry as the Successor of Peter. There I
wrote
that <i>man is the way of the Church</i>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">With these words I wanted first of all
to evoke the many paths along
which man walks, and at the same time to emphasize how deeply the
Church
desires to stand at his side as he follows the paths of his earthly
life.
The Church shares in the joys and hopes, the sorrows and anxieties of
people's
daily pilgrimage, firmly convinced that it was Christ himself who set
her
on all these paths. Christ entrusted man to the Church; he entrusted
man
to her as the "way" of her mission and her ministry.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>The family &#8211; way of the Church</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">2. Among these many paths, <i>the
family is the first and the most important.
</i>It is a path common to all, yet one which is particular, unique and
unrepeatable, just as every individual is unrepeatable; it is a path
from
which man cannot withdraw. Indeed, a person normally comes into the
world
within a family, and can be said to owe to the family the very fact of
his existing as an individual. When he has no family, the person coming
into the world develops an anguished sense of pain and loss, one which
will subsequently burden his whole life. The Church draws near with
loving
concern to all who experience situations such as these, for she knows
well
the fundamental role which the family is called upon to play.
Furthermore,
she knows that <i>a person goes forth from the family in order to
realize
in a new family unit his particular vocation in life. </i>Even if
someone
chooses to remain single, the family continues to be, as it were, his
existential
horizon, that fundamental community in which the whole network of
social
relations is grounded, from the closest and most immediate to the most
distant. Do we not often speak of the "human family" when referring
to all the people living in the world?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The family has its origin in that same
love with which the Creator embraces
the created world, as was already expressed "in the beginning",
in the <i>Book of Genesis </i>(1:1). In the Gospel Jesus offers a
supreme
confirmation: "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son"
(<i>Jn </i>3:16). The <i>only-begotten Son, </i>of one substance
with the
Father, <i>"God from God </i>and Light from Light", <i>entered
into human history through the family: </i>"For by his incarnation
the Son of God united himself in a certain way with every man. He
laboured
with human hands... and loved with a human heart. Born of Mary the
Virgin,
he truly became one of us and, except for sin, was like us in every
respect".
If in fact Christ "fully discloses man to himself", he does so
beginning with the family in which he chose to be born and to grow up.
We know that the Redeemer spent most of his life in the obscurity of
Nazareth,
"obedient" (<i>Lk </i>2:51) as the "Son of Man" to
Mary his Mother, and to Joseph the carpenter. Is this filial
"obedience"
of Christ not already the first expression of that obedience to the
Father
"unto death" (<i>Phil </i>2:8), whereby he redeemed the world?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><i>The divine mystery of the Incarnation
of the Word thus has an intimate
connection with the human family. </i>Not only with one family, that
of
Nazareth, but in some way with every family, analogously to what the
Second
Vatican Council says about the Son of God, who in the Incarnation
"united
himself in some sense with every man". Following Christ who "came"
into the world "to serve" (<i>Mt </i>20:28), the Church considers
serving the family to be one of her essential duties. In this sense
both
man and the family constitute "the way of the Church."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>The Year of the Family</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">3. For these very reasons <i>the Church
joyfully welcomes the decision
</i>of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">United Nations Organization</span>
<i>to declare 1994 the International
Year of the Family. </i>This initiative makes it clear how fundamental
the question of the family is for the member States of the United
Nations.
If the Church wishes to take part in this initiative, it is because she
herself has been sent by Christ to "all nations" (<i>Mt </i>28:19).
Moreover, this is not the first time the Church has made her own an
international
initiative of the United Nations. We need but recall, for example, the
International Year of Youth in 1985. In this way also the Church makes
herself present in the world, fulfilling a desire which was dear to
Pope
John XXIII, and which inspired the Second Vatican Council's
Constitution
<i>Gaudium et Spes. </i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">On the Feast of the Holy Family in 1993
the whole ecclesial community
began the "Year of the Family" as one of the important steps
along the path of preparation for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000,
which
will mark the end of the second and the beginning of the third
Millennium
of the Birth of Jesus Christ. This Year ought to direct our thoughts
and
our hearts towards Nazareth, where it was officially inaugurated this
past
26 December at a Solemn Eucharistic Liturgy presided over by the Papal
Legate.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Throughout this Year it is important to
discover anew the many<i> signs
of the Church's love and concern for the family, </i>a love and
concern
expressed from the very beginning of Christianity, when the meaningful
term <i>"domestic church" </i>was applied to the family. In our
own times we have often returned to the phrase "domestic church",
which the Council adopted and the sense of which we hope will always
remain
alive in people's minds. This desire is not lessened by an awareness of
the changed conditions of families in today's world. Precisely because
of this, there is a continuing relevance to the title chosen by the
Council
in the Pastoral Constitution <i>Gaudium et Spes </i>in order to
indicate
what the Church should be doing in the present situation: <i>"Promoting
the dignity of marriage and the family</i>". Another important
reference
point after the Council is the 1981 Apostolic Exhortation <i>Familiaris
Consortio. </i>This text takes into account a vast and complex
experience
with regard to the family, which among different peoples and countries
always and everywhere continues to be the "way of the Church".
In a certain sense it becomes all the more so precisely in those places
where the family is suffering from internal crises or is exposed to
adverse
cultural, social and economic influences which threaten its inner unity
and strength, and even stand in the way of its very formation.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>Prayer</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">4. In this Letter I wish to speak not to
families "in the abstract"
but <i>to every particular family in every part of the world, </i>wherever
it is located and whatever the diversity and complexity of its culture
and history. The love with which God "loved the world" (<i>Jn
</i>3:16), the love with which Christ loved each and every one "to
the end" (<i>Jn </i>13:1), makes it possible to address this message
to each family, as a living "cell" of the great and universal
"family" of mankind. The Father, Creator of the Universe, and
the Word Incarnate, the Redeemer of humanity, are the source of this
universal
openness to all people as brothers and sisters, and they impel us <i>to
embrace them in the prayer </i>which begins with the tender words: <i>"Our
Father</i>".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Prayer makes the Son of God present
among us: "For where two or
three are gathered in my name, I am there among them" (<i>Mt</i>
18:20).
This <i>Letter to Families </i>wishes in the first place to be a
prayer
to Christ to remain in every human family; an invitation to him, in and
through the small family of parents and children, to dwell in the great
family of nations, so that together with him all of us can truly say:
"Our
Father"! Prayer must become the dominant element of the Year of the
Family in the Church: prayer by the family, prayer for the family, and
prayer with the family.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">It is significant that precisely <i>in
and through prayer, man comes
to discover in a very simple and yet profound way his own unique
subjectivity:
</i>in prayer the human "I" more easily perceives the depth of
what it means to be a person. <i>This is also true of the family, </i>which
is not only the basic "cell" of society, but also possesses a
particular subjectivity of its own. This subjectivity finds its first
and
fundamental confirmation, and is strengthened, precisely when the
members
of the family meet in the common invocation: "Our Father". Prayer
increases the strength and spiritual unity of the family, helping the
family
to partake of God's own "strength". In the solemn nuptial blessing
during the Rite of Marriage, the celebrant calls upon the Lord in these
words: "Pour out upon them 1 the grace of the Holy Spirit so that
by your love poured into their hearts they will remain faithful in the
marriage covenant". This "visitation" of the Holy Spirit
gives rise to the inner strength of families, as well as the power
capable
of uniting them in love and truth.</font></p>
. . . .<br>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Let us pray for families throughout the
world. Let us pray, through
Christ, with him and in him, to the Father "from whom every family
in heaven and on earth is named" (<i>Eph </i>3:15).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>I</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>THE CIVILIZATION OF LOVE</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>"Male and female he created them"</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">6. The universe, immense and diverse as
it is, the world of all living
beings, <i>is inscribed in God's fatherhood, which is its source </i>(cf.
<i>Eph </i>3:14-16). This can be said, of course, on the basis of an
analogy,
thanks to which we can discern, at the very beginning of the Book of
Genesis,
the reality of fatherhood and motherhood and consequently of the human
family. The interpretative key enabling this discernment is provided by
the principle of the "image" and "likeness" of God
highlighted by the scriptural text (<i>Gen </i>1:26). God creates by
the
power of his word: "Let there be...!" (e.g., <i>Gen </i>1:3).
Significantly, in the creation of man this word of God is followed by
these
other words: <i>"Let us make man </i>in our image, after our
likeness"
(<i>Gen</i> 1:26). Before creating man, the Creator withdraws as it
were
into himself, in order to seek the pattern and inspiration in the
mystery
of his Being, which is already here disclosed as the divine "We".
From this mystery the human being comes forth by an act of creation: <i>"God
created man in his own image, </i>in the image of God he created him;
male
and female he created them" (<i>Gen</i> 1:27).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">God speaks to these newly-created beings
and he blesses them: "Be
fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it" (<i>Gen</i>
1:28). The Book of Genesis employs the same expressions used earlier
for
the creation of other living beings: "multiply". But it is clear
that these expressions are being used in an analogous sense. Is there
not
present here the analogy of begetting and of fatherhood and motherhood,
which should be understood in the light of the overall context? No
living
being on earth except man was created "in the image and likeness of
God". Human fatherhood and motherhood, while remaining <i>biologically
similar </i>to that of other living beings in nature, contain in an
essential
and unique way a <i>"likeness" to God </i>which is the basis
of the family as a community of human life, as a community of persons
united
in love (<i>communio personarum</i>).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In the light of the New Testament it is
possible to discern how<i> the
primordial model of the family is to be sought in God himself, </i>in
the
Trinitarian mystery of his life. The divine "We" is the eternal
pattern of the human "we", especially of that "we"
formed by the man and the woman created in the divine image and
likeness.
The words of the Book of Genesis contain that truth about man which is
confirmed by the very experience of humanity. Man is created "from
the very beginning" as male and female: the life of all humanity
&#8212;whether
of small communities or of society as a whole&#8212;is marked by this
primordial
duality. From it there derive the "masculinity" and the "femininity"
of individuals, just as from it every community draws its own unique
richness
in the mutual fulfilment of persons. This is what seems to be meant by
the words of the Book of Genesis: "Male and female he created them"
(<i>Gen </i>1:27). Here too we find the first statement of the equal
dignity
of man and woman: both, in equal measure, are persons. Their
constitution,
with the specific dignity which derives from it, defines "from the
beginning" the qualities of the common good of humanity, in every
dimension and circumstance of life. To this common good both man and
woman
make their specific contribution. Hence one can discover, at the very
origins
of human society, the qualities of communion and of complementarity.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>The marital covenant</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">7. The family has always been considered
as the first and basic expression
of man's <i>social nature. </i>Even today this way of looking at
things
remains unchanged. Nowadays, however, emphasis tends to be laid on how
much the family, as the smallest and most basic human community, owes
to
the personal contribution of a man and a woman. The family is in fact a
community of persons whose proper way of existing and living together
is
communion: <i>communio personarum. </i>Here too, while always
acknowledging
the absolute transcendence of the Creator with regard to his creatures,
we can see the family's ultimate relationship to the divine "We".
<i>Only persons are capable of living "in communion". </i>The
family originates in a marital communion described by the Second
Vatican
Council as a "covenant", <i>in which man and woman "give
themselves to each other and accept each other</i>".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">. . . . <br>
When, in union with the Apostle, we bow our knees before the Father
from whom all fatherhood and motherhood is named (cf. <i>Eph</i>
3:14-15),
we come to realize that parenthood is the event whereby the family,
already
constituted by the conjugal covenant of marriage, is brought about "in
the full and specific sense".<i> Motherhood necessarily implies
fatherhood,
</i>and in turn,<i> fatherhood necessarily implies motherhood. </i>This
is the result of the duality bestowed by the Creator upon human beings
"from the beginning".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">I have spoken of two closely related yet
not identical concepts: the
concept of "communion" and that of "community".<i>
"Communion</i>" has to do with the personal relationship between
the "I" and the "thou". <i>"Community</i>"
on the other hand transcends this framework and moves towards a
"society",
a "we". The family, as a community of persons, is thus the first
human "society". It arises whenever there comes into being the
conjugal covenant of marriage, which opens the spouses to a lasting
communion
of love and of life, and it is brought to completion in a full and
specific
way with the procreation of children: the "communion" of the
spouses gives rise to the "community" of the family. The "community"
of the family is completely pervaded by the very essence of
"communion".
On the human level, can there be any other <i>"communion</i>"
comparable to that <i>between a mother and a child</i> whom she has
carried
in her womb and then brought to birth?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In the family thus constituted there
appears a new unity, in which the
relationship "of communion" between the parents attains complete
fulfilment. Experience teaches that this fulfilment represents both a
task
and a challenge. The task involves the spouses in living out their
original
covenant. <i>The children </i>born to them&#8212;and here is the challenge<i>&#8212;should
consolidate that covenant, </i>enriching and deepening the conjugal
communion
of the father and mother. When this does not occur, we need to ask if
the
selfishness which lurks even in the love of man and woman as a result
of
the human inclination to evil is not stronger than this love. Married
couples
need to be well aware of this. From the outset they need to have their
hearts and thoughts turned towards the God "from whom every family
is named", <i>so that their fatherhood and motherhood will draw from
that source the power to be continually renewed in love</i>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Fatherhood and motherhood are themselves
a particular proof of love;
they make it possible to discover love's extension and original depth.
But this does not take place automatically. Rather, it is a task
entrusted
to both husband and wife. In the life of husband and wife together,
fatherhood
and motherhood represent such a sublime "novelty" and richness
as can only be approached "on one's knees".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Experience teaches that human love,
which naturally tends towards fatherhood
and motherhood, is sometimes affected by a profound <i>crisis </i>and
is
thus seriously threatened. In such cases, help can be sought at
marriage
and family counselling centres, where it is possible, among other
things,
to obtain the assistance of specifically trained psychologists and
psychotherapists.
At the same time, however, we cannot forget the perennial validity of
the
words of the Apostle: "I bow my knees before the Father, from whom
every family in heaven and on earth is named". Marriage, the Sacrament
of Matrimony, is a covenant of persons in love. And <i>love can be
deepened
and preserved only by Love, </i>that Love which is "poured into our
hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (<i>Rom
</i>5:5). During the Year of the Family should our prayer not
concentrate
on the crucial and decisive moment of the passage from conjugal love to
childbearing, and thus to fatherhood and motherhood? Is that not
precisely
the moment when there is an indispensable need for the "outpouring
of the grace of the Holy Spirit" invoked in the liturgical celebration
of the Sacrament of Matrimony?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">. . . <br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">This rich and meaningful formulation
first of all confirms what is central
to the identity of every man and every woman. This identity consists in
the <i>capacity to live in truth and love; </i>even more, it consists
in
the need of truth and love as an essential dimension of the life of the
person. Man's need for truth and love opens him both to God and to
creatures:
it opens him to other people, to life "in communion", and in
particular to marriage and to the family. In the words of the Council,
the "communion" of persons is drawn in a certain sense from the
mystery of the Trinitarian "We", and therefore "conjugal
communion" also refers to this mystery. The family, which originates
in the love of man and woman, ultimately derives from the mystery of
God.
This conforms to the innermost being of man and woman, to their innate
and authentic dignity as persons.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In marriage man and woman are so firmly
united as to become&#8212;to use the
words of the Book of Genesis&#8212;"one flesh" (<i>Gen </i>2:24). Male
and female in their physical constitution, the two human subjects, even
though physically different, <i>share equally in the capacity to live
"in
truth and love". </i>This capacity, characteristic of the human being
as a person, has at the same time both a spiritual and a bodily
dimension.
It is also through the body that man and woman are predisposed to form
a "communion of persons" in marriage. When they are united by
the conjugal covenant in such a way as to become <i>"one flesh</i>"
(<i>Gen </i>2:24), their<i>union </i>ought to take place <i>"in
truth
and love</i>", and thus express the maturity proper to persons created
in the image and likeness of God.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">. . . .<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">As the Council affirms, man is "the only
creature on earth whom
God willed for its own sake". Man's coming into being does not conform
to the laws of biology alone, but also, and directly, to God's creative
will, which is concerned with the genealogy of the sons and daughters
of
human families. <i>God "willed" man from the very beginning,
and God "wills" him in every act of conception and every human
birth. </i>God "wills" man as a being similar to himself, as
a person. This man, every man, is created by God <i>"for his own sake</i>".
That is true of all persons, including those born with sicknesses or
disabilities.
Inscribed in the personal constitution of every human being is the will
of God, who wills that man should be, in a certain sense, an end unto
himself.
God hands man over to himself, entrusting him both to his family and to
society as their responsibility. Parents, in contemplating a new human
being, are, or ought to be, fully aware of the fact that God "wills"
this individual "for his own sake".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">This concise expression is profoundly
rich in meaning. From the very
moment of conception, and then of birth, the new being is meant <i>to
express
fully his humanity, </i>to "find himself" as a person. This is
true for absolutely everyone, including the chronically ill and the
disabled.
"To be human" is his fundamental vocation: "to be human"
in accordance with the gift received, in accordance with that "talent"
which is humanity itself, and only then in accordance with other
talents.
In this sense God wills every man "for his own sake". <i>In God's
plan,</i> however, the vocation of the human person extends beyond the
boundaries of time. It encounters the will of the Father revealed in
the
Incarnate Word: <i>God's will is to lavish upon man a sharing in his
own
divine life. </i>As Christ says: "I came that they may have life and
have it abundantly" (<i>Jn </i>10:10).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Does affirming man's ultimate destiny
not conflict with the statement
that God wills man "for his own sake"? If he has been created
for divine life, can man truly exist "for his own sake"? This
is a critical question, one of great significance both for the
beginning
of his earthly life and its end: it is important for the whole span of
his life. It might appear that in destining man for divine life God
definitively
takes away man's existing "for his own sake". What then is the
relationship between the life of the person and his sharing in the life
of the Trinity? Saint Augustine provides us with the answer in his
celebrated
phrase: "Our heart is restless until it rests in you". This "restless
heart" serves to point out that between the one finality and the other
there is in fact no contradiction, but rather a relationship, a
complementarity,
a unity. By his very genealogy, the person created in the image and
likeness
of God,<i> exists "for his own sake" </i>and reaches fulfilment
precisely <i>by sharing in God's life. </i>The content of this
self-fulfilment
is the fullness of life in God, proclaimed by Christ (cf. <i>Jn </i>6:37-40),
who redeemed us precisely so that we might come to share it (cf.<i> Mk
</i>10:45).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">It is for themselves that married
couples want children; in children
they see the crowning of their own love for each other. They want
children
for the family, as a <i>priceless gift</i>. This is quite
understandable.
Nonetheless, in conjugal love and in paternal and maternal love we
should
find inscribed the same truth about man which the Council expressed in
a clear and concise way in its statement that God "willed man for
his own sake". It is thus necessary that the will of the parents should
be in harmony with the will of God. <i>They must want the new human
creature
in the same way as the Creator wants him: </i>"for himself". <br>
. . . .<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>The common good of marriage and
the family</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">10. Marital consent defines and
consolidates <i>the good common to marriage
and to the family. </i>"I, N., take you, N., to be my wifehusband.
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and
in
health. I will love you and honour you all the days of my life".
Marriage
is a unique communion of persons, and it is on the basis of this
communion
that the family is called to become a community of persons. This is a
commitment
which the bride and groom undertake "before God and his Church",
as the celebrant reminds them before they exchange their consent. Those
who take part in the rite are witnesses of this commitment, for in a
certain
sense they represent the Church and society, the settings in which the
new family will live and grow.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The words of consent define the common
good of the <i>couple and of
the family. </i>First, the common good of the spouses: love, fidelity,
honour, the permanence of their union until death&#8212;"all the days of
my life". The good of both, which is at the same time the good of
each, must then become the good of the children. The common good, by
its
very nature, both unites individual persons and ensures the true good
of
each. If the Church (and the State for that matter) receives the
consent
which the spouses express in the words cited above, she does so because
that consent is "written in their hearts" (<i>Rom </i>2:15).
It is the spouses who give their consent to each other by a solemn
promise,
that is by confirming the truth of that consent in the sight of God. As
baptized Christians, they are the ministers of the Sacrament of
Matrimony
in the Church. Saint Paul teaches that this mutual commitment of theirs
is a "great mystery" (<i>Eph </i>5:32).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The words of consent, then, express what
is essential to the common
good of the spouses, and <i>they indicate what ought to be the common
good
of the future family. </i>In order to bring this out, the Church asks
the
spouses if they are prepared to accept the children God grants them and
to raise the children as Christians. This question calls to mind the
common
good of the future family unit, evoking the genealogy of persons which
is part of the constitution of marriage and of the family itself. The
question
about children and their education is profoundly linked to marital
consent,
with its solemn promise of love, conjugal respect, and fidelity until
death.
The acceptance and education of children&#8212;two of the primary ends of the
family&#8212;are conditioned by how that commitment will be fulfilled.
Fatherhood
and motherhood represent a <i>responsibility which is not simply
physical
but spiritual in nature; </i>indeed, through these realities there
passes
the genealogy of the person, which has its eternal beginning in God and
which must lead back to him.<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">. . . . .<br>
In prayer everyone should be present: the living and those who have
died,
and also those yet to come into the world. Families should pray for all
of their members, in view of the good which the family is for each
individual
and which each individual is for the whole family. Prayer strengthens
this
good, precisely as the common good of the family. Moreover, it creates
this good ever anew. In prayer, the family discovers itself as the
first
"us", in which each member is <i>"I</i>" and <i>"thou</i>";
each member is for the others either husband or wife, father or mother,
son or daughter, brother or sister, grandparent or grandchild.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Are all the families to which this
Letter is addressed like this? Certainly
a good number are, but the times in which we are living tend to
restrict
family units to two generations. Often this is the case because
available
housing is too limited, especially in large cities. But it is not
infrequently
due to the belief that having several generations living together
interferes
with privacy and makes life too difficult. But is this not where the
problem
really lies? <i>Families today have too little "human" life.
</i>There is a shortage of people with whom to create and share the
common
good; and yet that good, by its nature, demands to be created and
shared
with others: <i>bonum est diffusivum sui: </i>"good is diffusive of
itself". The more <i>common</i> the good, the <i>more properly one's
own </i>it will also be: mine &#8211; yours &#8211; ours. This is the logic behind
living according to the good, living in truth and charity. If man is
able
to accept and follow this logic, his life truly becomes a "sincere
gift".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>The sincere gift of self</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">11. After affirming that man is the only
creature on earth which God
willed for itself, the Council immediately goes on to say that he <i>cannot
"fully find himself except through a sincere gift of self</i>".
This might appear to be a contradiction, but in fact it is not. Instead
it is the magnificent paradox of human existence: an existence called <i>to
serve the truth in love. </i>Love causes man to find fulfilment
through
the sincere gift of self. To love means to give and to receive
something
which can be neither bought nor sold, but only given freely and
mutually.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">By its very nature the gift of the
person must be lasting and irrevocable.
The indissolubility of marriage flows in the first place from the very
essence of that gift: <i>the gift of one person to another person. </i>This
reciprocal giving of self reveals the<i> spousal nature of love. <br>
</i></font></p>
. . . .<br>
<p align="left"><font size="3">But is it really true that the new human
being is a gift for his parents?
A gift for society? Apparently nothing seems to indicate this. On
occasion
the birth of a child appears to be a simple statistical fact,
registered
like so many other data in demographic records. It is true that for the
parents the birth of a child means more work, new financial burdens and
further inconveniences, all of which can lead to the temptation not to
want another birth. In some social and cultural contexts this
temptation
can become very strong. Does this mean that a child is not a gift? That
it comes into the world only to take and not to give? These are some of
the disturbing questions which men and women today find hard to escape.
<i>A child comes to take up room, when it seems that there is less and
less room in the world. </i>But is it really true that a child brings
nothing
to the family and society? Is not every child a "particle" of
that common good without which human communities break down and risk
extinction?
Could this ever really be denied? The child becomes a gift to its
brothers,
sisters, parents and entire family. <i>Its life becomes a gift for the
very people who were givers of life </i>and who cannot help but feel
its
presence, its sharing in their life and its contribution to their
common
good and to that of the community of the family. This truth is obvious
in its simplicity and profundity, whatever the complexity and even the
possible pathology of the psychological make-up of certain persons. <i>The
common good of the whole of society dwells in man; </i>he is, as we
recalled,
"the way of the Church". Man is first of all the "glory
of God": <i>"Gloria Dei vivens homo</i>", in the celebrated
words of Saint Irenaeus, which might also be translated: "the glory
of God is for man to be alive". It could be said that here we encounter
the loftiest definition of man: <i>the glory of God is the common good
of all that exists; </i>the common good of the human race.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Yes! <i>Man is a common good: </i>a
common good of the family and of
humanity, of individual groups and of different communities. But there
are significant distinctions of degree and modality in this regard. Man
is a common good, for example, of the Nation to which he belongs and of
the State of which he is a citizen; but in a much more concrete, unique
and unrepeatable way he is a common good of his family. He is such not
only as an individual who is part of the multitude of humanity, but
rather
as <i>"this individual</i>". God the Creator calls him into existence
"for himself"; and in coming into the world he begins, in the
family, his "great adventure", the adventure of human life. "This
man" has, in every instance, <i>the right to fulfil himself on the
basis of his human dignity. </i>It is precisely this dignity which
establishes
a person's place among others, and above all, in the family. The family
is indeed&#8212;more than any other human reality&#8212; the place where an
individual
can exist "for himself" through the sincere gift of self. This
is why it remains a social institution which neither can nor should be
replaced: it is the "sanctuary of life".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The fact that a child is being born,
that "a child is born into
the world" (<i>Jn </i>16:21) is a <i>paschal sign. </i>As we read
in the Gospel of John, Jesus himself speaks of this to the disciples
before
his passion and death, comparing their sadness at his departure with
the
pains of a woman in labour: <i>"When a woman is in travail she has
sorrow </i>(that is, she suffers), because <i>her hour </i>has come;
but
when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembers the
anguish,
for <i>joy that a child is born into the world</i>" (<i>Jn </i>16:21).
The "hour" of Christ's death (cf. <i>Jn </i>13:1) is compared
here to the "hour" of the woman in birthpangs; the birth of a
new child fully reflects the victory of life over death brought about
by
the Lord's Resurrection. This comparison can provide us with material
for
reflection. Just as the Resurrection of Christ is the manifestation of
<i>Life </i>beyond the threshold of death, so too the birth of an
infant
is a manifestation of life, which is always destined, through Christ,
for
that <i>"fullness of life" which is in God himself: </i>"I
came that they may have life, and have it abundantly" (<i>Jn </i>10:10).
Here we see revealed the deepest meaning of Saint Irenaeus's
expression:
<i>"Gloria Dei vivens homo</i>".</font></p>
. . . .<br>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>Responsible fatherhood and
motherhood</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">12. It is now time, in this Letter to
Families, to bring up two closely
related questions. The first, more general, concerns the <i>civilization
of love; </i>the other, more specific, deals with<i> responsible
fatherhood
and motherhood.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">We have already said that marriage
engenders a particular responsibility
for the common good, first of the spouses and then of the family. This
common good is constituted by man, by the<i> worth of the person </i>and
by everything which represents the<i> measure of his dignity. </i>This
reality is part of man in every social, economic and political system.
In the area of marriage and the family, this responsibility becomes,
for
a variety of reasons, even more "demanding". The Pastoral Constitution
<i>Gaudium et Spes </i>rightly speaks of <i>"promoting the dignity
of marriage and the family</i>". The Council sees this "promotion"
as a duty incumbent upon both the Church and the State. Nevertheless,
in
every culture this duty remains primarily that of the persons who,
united
in marriage, form a particular family. "Responsible fatherhood and
motherhood" express a concrete commitment to carry out this duty,
which has taken on new characteristics in the contemporary world.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><i>. . . . They then experience a moment
of special responsibility, </i>which
is also the result of the procreative potential linked to the conjugal
act. At that moment, the spouses can become father and mother,
initiating
the process of a new human life, which will then develop in the woman's
womb. If the wife is the first to realize that she has become a mother,
the husband, to whom she has been united in "one flesh", then
learns this when she tells him that he has become a father. Both are
responsible
for their potential and later actual fatherhood and motherhood. The
husband
cannot fail to acknowledge and accept the result of a decision which
has
also been his own. He cannot hide behind expressions such as: "I don't
know", "I didn't want it", or "you're the one who wanted
it". In every case conjugal union involves <i>the responsibility of
the man and of the woman, </i>a potential responsibility which becomes
actual when the circumstances dictate. This is true especially for the
man. Although he too is involved in the beginning of the generative
process,
he is left biologically distant from it; it is within the woman that
the
process develops. How can the man fail to assume responsibility? The
man
and the woman must assume together, before themselves and before
others,
the responsibility for the new life which they have brought into
existence.</font></p>
. . . . <br>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>The two civilizations</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">13. Dear families, the question of
responsible fatherhood and motherhood
is an integral part of the "civilization of love", which I now
wish to discuss with you. From what has already been said it is clear
that
<i>the family is fundamental to what Pope Paul VI called the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"civilization
of love</span></i><span style="font-weight: bold;">",</span> an
expression which has entered the teaching of the
Church and by now has become familiar. Today it is difficult to imagine
a statement by the Church, or about the Church, which does not mention
the civilization of love. The phrase <i>is linked to the tradition of
the
"domestic church" in early Christianity, </i>but it has a particular
significance for the present time. Etymologically the word
"civilization"
is derived from <i>"civis</i>" &#8211; "citizen", and it
emphasizes the civic or political dimension of the life of every
individual.
But the most profound meaning of the term "civilization" is not
merely political, but rather pertains to human culture. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Civilization belongs
to human history because it answers man's spiritual and moral needs</span>.
Created
in the image and likeness of God, man has received the world from the
hands
of the Creator, together with the task of shaping it in his own image
and
likeness. The fulfilment of this task gives rise to civilization, which
in the final analysis is nothing else than the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"humanization of the
world".</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In a certain sense civilization means
the same thing as "culture".
And so one could also speak of the <i style="font-weight: bold;">"culture
of love</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span>,
even though it is preferable to keep to the now familiar expression.
The
civilization of love, in its current meaning, is inspired by the words
of the conciliar Constitution <i>Gaudium et Spes: "Christ... fully
discloses man to himself and unfolds his noble calling</i>". And so
we can say that the civilization of love originates in the revelation
of
the God who "is love", as John writes (<i>1 Jn </i>4:8, 16);
it is effectively described by Paul in the hymn of charity found in his
First Letter to the Corinthians (13:1-13). This civilization is
intimately
linked to the love "poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit
which has been given to us" (<i>Rom </i>5:5), and it grows as a result
of the <i>constant cultivation </i>which the Gospel allegory of the
vine
and the branches describes in such a direct way: "I am the true vine,
and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch of mine that bears no
fruit,
he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it
may bear more fruit" (<i>Jn</i> 15:1-2).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In the light of these and other texts of
the New Testament it is possible
to understand what is meant by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"civilization
of love", and
why the </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">family is organically
linked to this civilization. </i>If the
first "way of the Church" is the family, it should also be said
that the civilization of love is also the "way of the Church",
which journeys through the world and summons families to this way; it
summons
also other social, national and international institutions, because of
families and through families. <i>The family in fact depends </i>for
several
reasons <i>on the civilization of love, </i>and finds therein the
reasons
for its existence as family. And at the same time <i>the family is the
centre and the heart of the civilization of love.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Yet there is no true love without an
awareness that God "is Love"&#8212;and
that man is the only creature on earth which God has called into
existence
"for its own sake". Created in the image and likeness of God,
man cannot fully "find himself" except through the sincere gift
of self. Without such a concept of man, of the person and the
"communion
of persons" in the family, there can be no civilization of love;
similarly,
without the civilization of love it is impossible to have <i>such a
concept
of person and of the communion of persons. </i>The family constitutes
the
fundamental "cell" of society. But Christ&#8212;the "vine"
from which the "branches" draw nourishment&#8212;is needed so that
this cell will not be exposed to the threat of a kind of <i>cultural
uprooting</i>
which can come both from within and from without. Indeed, although
there
is on the one hand the "civilization of love", there continues
to exist on the other hand <i>the possibility of a destructive
"anti-civilization",
</i>as so many present trends and situations confirm.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Who can deny that our age is one marked
by a great crisis, which appears
above all as a profound <i>"crisis of truth</i>"? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A crisis of
truth means, in the first place, a </span><i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">crisis of concepts.</span> </i>Do the
words
"love", "freedom", "sincere gift", and even
"person" and "rights of the person", really convey
their essential meaning? This is why the Encyclical on the "splendour
of truth" (<i>Veritatis Splendor</i>) has proved so meaningful and
important for the Church and for the world&#8212;especially in the West. Only
if the truth about freedom and the communion of persons in marriage and
in the family can regain its splendour, will the building of the
civilization
of love truly begin and will it then be possible to speak concretely&#8212;as
the Council did&#8212;about "promoting the dignity of marriage and the
family".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Why is the "splendour of truth" so
important? First of all,
by way of contrast: the development of contemporary civilization is
linked
to a scientific and technological progress which is often achieved in a
one-sided way, and thus appears purely positivistic. Positivism, as we
know, results in agnosticism in theory and utilitarianism in practice
and
in ethics. In our own day, history is in a way repeating itself. <i>Utilitarianism
</i>is a civilization of production and of use, a civilization of
"things"
and not of "persons", a civilization in which persons are used
in the same way as things are used. In the context of a civilization of
use, woman can become an object for man, children a hindrance to
parents,
the family an institution obstructing the freedom of its members. To be
convinced that this is the case, one need only look at <i>certain
sexual
education programmes</i> introduced into the schools, often
notwithstanding
the disagreement and even the protests of many parents; or<i>
pro-abortion
tendencies </i>which vainly try to hide behind the so-called "right
to choose" (<i>"pro-choice</i>") on the part of both spouses,
and in particular on the part of the woman. These are only two
examples;
many more could be mentioned.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">It is evident that in this sort of a
cultural situation the family cannot
fail to feel threatened, since it is endangered at its very foundations.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Everything </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">contrary to the
civilization of love </i><span style="font-weight: bold;">is contrary
to the
whole truth about man and becomes a threat to him:</span> it does not
allow him
to find himself and to feel secure, as spouse, parent, or child.
So-called
"safe sex", which is touted by the "civilization of technology",
is actually, in view of the overall requirements of the person,
radically
<i>not safe, </i>indeed it is extremely dangerous. It endangers both
the
person and the family. And what is this danger? It is <i>the loss of
the
truth about one's own self and about the family, </i>together with the
risk of a loss of <i>freedom </i>and consequently of a loss of <i>love
</i>itself. "You will know the truth", Jesus says, "and
the truth will make you free" (<i>Jn </i>8:32): the truth, and only
the truth, will prepare you for a love which can be called "fairest
love" (cf. <i>Sir </i>24:24, Vulg.).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
contemporary family, like families in every age, </span><i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">is searching
for "fairest love".</span> </i>A love which is not "fairest",
but reduced only to the satisfaction of concupiscence (cf. <i>1 Jn</i>
2:16), or to a man's and a woman's mutual "use" of each other,
makes persons <i>slaves to their weaknesses. </i>Do not certain
modern
"cultural agendas" lead to this enslavement? There are agendas
which "play" on man's weaknesses, and thus make him increasingly
weak and defenceless.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><i>The civilization of love evokes joy: </i>joy,
among other things,
for the fact that a man has come into the world (cf. <i>Jn </i>16:21),
and consequently because spouses have become parents. The civilization
of love means "rejoicing in the right" (cf. <i>1 Cor</i> 13:6).
But a civilization inspired by a consumerist, anti-birth mentality is
not
and cannot ever be a civilization of love. If the family is so
important
for the civilization of love, it is because of the particular <i>closeness
and intensity of the bonds</i> which come to be between persons and
generations
within the family. However, the family remains <i>vulnerable </i>and
can
easily fall prey to dangers which weaken it or actually destroy its
unity
and stability. As a result of these dangers families cease to be
witnesses
of the civilization of love and can even become a negation of it, a
kind
of <i>counter-sign. </i>A broken family can, for its part,
consolidate
a specific form of "anti-civilization", destroying love in its
various expressions, with inevitable consequences for the whole of life
in society.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>Love is demanding</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">14. The love which the Apostle Paul
celebrates in the First Letter to
the Corinthians&#8212;the love which is <i>"patient" and "kind",</i>
and <i>"endures all things" </i>(<i>1 Cor </i>13:4, 7)&#8212;is certainly
<i>a demanding love. </i>But this is precisely the source of its
beauty:
by the very fact that it is demanding, it builds up the true good of
man
and allows it to radiate to others. The good, says Saint Thomas, is by
its nature "diffusive". Love is true when <i>it creates the good
of persons and of communities; </i>it creates that good and <i>gives
it</i>
to others. Only the one who is able to be demanding with himself in the
name of love can also demand love from others. Love is demanding. It
makes
demands in all human situations; it is even more demanding in the case
of those who are open to the Gospel. Is this not what Christ proclaims
in "his" commandment? Nowadays people need to rediscover this
demanding love, for it is the truly firm foundation of the family, a
foundation
able to "endure all things". According to the Apostle, love is
not able to "endure all things" if it yields to "jealousies",
or if it is "boastful... arrogant or rude" (cf. <i>1 Cor </i>13:5-6).
True love, Saint Paul teaches, is different: "Love believes all things,
hopes all things, endures all things" (<i>1 Cor </i>13:7). This is
the very love which "endures all things". At work within it is
the power and strength of God himself, who "is love" (<i>1 Jn
</i>4:8, 16). At work within it is also the power and strength of
Christ,
the Redeemer of man and Saviour of the world.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Meditating on the thirteenth chapter of
the First Letter of Paul to
the Corinthians, we set out on a path which leads us to understand
quickly
and clearly the full truth about the civilization of love. No other
biblical
text expresses this truth so simply and so profoundly as the <i>hymn
to
love.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The dangers faced by love are also
dangers for the civilization of love,
because they promote everything capable of effectively opposing it.
Here
one thinks first of all of <i>selfishness, </i>not only the
selfishness
of individuals, but also of couples or, even more broadly, of social
selfishness,
that for example of a class or nation (nationalism). Selfishness in all
its forms is directly and radically opposed to the civilization of
love.
But is love to be defined simply as "anti-selfishness"? This
would be a very impoverished and ultimately a purely negative
definition,
even though it is true that different forms of selfishness must be
overcome
in order to realize love and the civilization of love. It would be more
correct to speak of "altruism", which is the opposite of selfishness.
But far richer and more complete is the concept of love illustrated by
Saint Paul. The hymn to love in the First Letter to the Corinthians
remains
the <i>Magna Charta </i>of the civilization of love. In this concept,
what
is important is not so much individual actions (whether selfish or
altruistic),
so much as the radical acceptance of the understanding of man as a
person
who "finds himself" by making a sincere gift of self. A gift
is, obviously, <span style="font-weight: bold;">"for others": this is </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">the most important dimension
</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">of the civilization of love.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">We thus come to the very heart of the
Gospel truth about<i><span style="font-weight: bold;"> freedom.</span>
</i>The person realizes himself by the exercise of freedom in truth.
Freedom
cannot be understood as a license to do<i> absolutely anything: </i>it
means a <i>gift of self. </i>Even more: it means an <i>interior
discipline
of the gift. </i>The idea of gift contains not only the free
initiative
of the subject, but also the aspect of<i> duty. </i>All this is made
real
in the "communion of persons". We find ourselves again at the
very heart of each family.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Continuing this line of thought, we also
<i>come upon <span style="font-weight: bold;">the antithesis
between individualism and personalism. </span></i>Love, the
civilization of love,
is bound up with personalism. Why with personalism? And <i>why does
individualism
threaten the civilization of love? </i>We find a key to answering this
in the Council's expression, a "sincere gift". Individualism
presupposes a use of freedom in which the subject does what he wants,
in
which he himself is the one to "establish the truth" of whatever
he finds pleasing or useful. He does not tolerate the fact that someone
else "wants" or demands something from him in the name of an
objective truth. He does not want to "give" to another on the
basis of truth; he does not want to become a "sincere gift".
Individualism thus remains egocentric and selfish. The real antithesis
between individualism and personalism emerges not only on the level of
theory, but even more <i>on that of "ethos". </i>The "ethos"
of personalism is altruistic: it moves the person to become a gift for
others and to discover joy in giving himself. This is the joy about
which
Christ speaks (cf. <i>Jn </i>15:11; 16:20, 22).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">What is needed then is for human
societies, and the families who live
within them, often in a context of struggle between the civilization of
love and its opposites, to seek their solid foundation in a correct
vision
of man and of everything which determines the full "realization"
of his humanity. <i>Opposed to the civilization of love </i>is
certainly
the phenomenon of so-called<i> "free love</i>"; this is particularly
dangerous because it is usually suggested as a way of following one's
"real"
feelings, but it is in fact destructive of love. How many families have
been ruined because of "free love"! To follow in every instance
a "real" emotional impulse by invoking a love "liberated"
from all conditionings, means nothing more than to make the individual
a slave to those human instincts which Saint Thomas calls "passions
of the soul". "Free love" exploits human weaknesses; it
gives them a certain "veneer" of respectability with the help
of seduction and the blessing of public opinion. In this way there is
an
attempt to "soothe" consciences by creating a "moral alibi".
But not all of the consequences are taken into consideration,
especially
when the ones who end up paying are, apart from the other spouse, the
children,
deprived of a father or mother and condemned to be in fact <i>orphans
of
living parents.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">As we know, at the foundation of ethical
utilitarianism there is the
continual quest for "maximum" happiness. But this is a<i> "utilitarian
happiness</i>", seen only as pleasure, as immediate gratification
for the exclusive benefit of the individual, apart from or opposed to
the
objective demands of the true good.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The programme of utilitarianism, based
on an individualistic understanding
of freedom<i>&#8212;a freedom without responsibilities</i>&#8212;is the opposite of
love, even as an expression of human civilization considered as a
whole.
When this concept of freedom is embraced by society, and quickly allies
itself with varied forms of human weakness, it soon proves a systematic
and permanent threat to the family. In this regard, one could mention
many
dire consequences, which can be statistically verified, even though a
great
number of them are hidden in the hearts of men and women like painful,
fresh wounds.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><i>The love of spouses and parents has
the capacity to cure these kinds
of wounds, </i>provided the dangers alluded to do not deprive it of
its
regenerative force, which is so beneficial and wholesome a thing for
human
communities. This capacity depends on the divine grace of forgiveness
and
reconciliation, which always ensures the spiritual energy to begin
anew.
For this very reason family members need to encounter Christ in the
Church
through the wonderful Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In this context, we can realize how
important <i>prayer </i>is with
families and for families, in particular for those threatened by
division.
We need to pray that married couples <i>will love their vocation, </i>even
when the road becomes difficult, or the paths become narrow, uphill and
seemingly insuperable; we need to pray that, even then, they will be
faithful
to their covenant with God.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">"The family is the way of the Church".
In this Letter we wish
both to profess and to proclaim <i>this way</i>, which leads to the
kingdom
of heaven (cf. <i>Mt </i>7:14) through conjugal and family life. It
is
important that the "communion of persons" in the family should
become a preparation for the "communion of Saints". This is why
the Church both believes and proclaims the love which "endures all
things" (<i>1 Cor </i>13:7); with Saint Paul she sees in it <i>"the
greatest</i>" virtue of all (cf. <i>1 Cor </i>13:13). The Apostle
puts no limits on anyone. Everyone is called to love, including spouses
and families. In the Church everyone is called equally to perfect
holiness
(cf. <i>Mt </i>5:48).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>The fourth commandment: "Honour
your father and your mother"</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">15. The fourth commandment of the
Decalogue deals with the family and
its interior unity&#8212;its solidarity, we could say.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In its formulation, the fourth
commandment does not explicitly mention
the family. In fact, however, this is its real subject matter. In order
to bring out the communion between generations, <i>the divine
Legislator
could find no more appropriate word than this: </i>"Honour..."
(<i>Ex </i>20:12). Here we meet another way of expressing what the
family
is. This formulation does not exalt the family in some "artificial"
way, but emphasizes its subjectivity and the rights flowing from it.
The
family is a community of particularly intense interpersonal
relationships:
between spouses, between parents and children, between generations. It
is a community which must be safeguarded in a special way. And God
cannot
find a better safeguard than this: "Honour".<br>
. . . . <br>
In any event,
this does not lessen the fundamental meaning of the imperative <i>"honour</i>",
which by its nature suggests an <i>attitude of unselfishness. </i>To
honour
never means: "calculate the benefits". It is difficult, on the
other hand, not to acknowledge the fact that an attitude of mutual
honour
among members of the family community also brings certain advantages. <i>"Honour"
is certainly something useful, </i>just as every true good is "useful".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In the first place, the family achieves
the good of "being together".
This is the good par excellence of marriage (hence its indissolubility)
and of the family community. It could also be defined as a good of the
subject as such. Just as the person is a subject, so too is the family,
since it is made up of persons, who, joined together by a profound bond
of communion, form a single <i>communal subject.</i> Indeed, the
family
is more a subject than any other social institution: more so than the
nation
or the State, more so than society and international organizations.
These
societies, especially nations, possess a proper subjectivity to the
extent
that they receive it from persons and their families. Are all these
merely
"theoretical" observations, formulated for the purpose of "exalting"
the family before public opinion? No, but they are another way of
expressing
what the family is. And this too can be deduced from the fourth
commandment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">This truth deserves to be emphasized and
more deeply understood: indeed
it brings out the importance of the fourth commandment for the modern
system
of <i>human rights. </i>Institutions and legal systems employ
juridical
language. But God says: "honour". <span style="font-weight: bold;">All
"human rights"
are ultimately fragile and ineffective, if at their root they lack the
command to "honour"; in other words, if they lack </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">an acknowledgment
of the individual</i><span style="font-weight: bold;"> simply because
he is an individual, "this"
individual. </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Of themselves, rights
are not enough.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is
not an exaggeration to reaffirm that the life of nations, of states,
and of international organizations "passes" through the family
and "is based" on the fourth commandment of the Decalogue.</span> The
age in which we live, notwithstanding the many juridical Declarations
which
have been drafted, <i>is still threatened to a great extent by
"alienation".
</i>This is the result of "Enlightenment" premises according
to which a man is "more" human if he is "only" human.
It is not difficult to notice how alienation from everything belonging
in various ways to the full richness of man threatens our times. And
this
affects the family. Indeed, <i>the affirmation of the person </i>is
in
great measure to be referred back <i>to the family </i>and
consequently
to the fourth commandment. In God's plan the family is in many ways the
first school of how to be human. <i>Be human! </i>This is the
imperative
passed on in the family&#8212;human as the son or daughter of one's country,
a citizen of the State, and, we would say today, a citizen of the
world.
The God who gave humanity the fourth commandment is "benevolent"
towards man (<i>philanthropos, </i>as the Greeks said). The Creator of
the universe is <i>the God of love and of life: </i>he wants man to
have
life and have it abundantly, as Christ proclaims (cf. <i>Jn </i>10:10);
that he may have life, first of all thanks to the family.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">At this point it seems clear that the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"civilization of love"
is strictly bound up with the family.</span> <i>For many people the
civilization
of love is still a pure utopia. </i>Indeed, there are those who think
that
love cannot be demanded from anyone and that it cannot be imposed: love
should be a free choice which people can take or leave.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">There is some truth in all this. And yet
there is always the fact that
Jesus Christ left us the commandment of love, just as God on Mount
Sinai
ordered: "Honour your father and your mother". Love then is not
a utopia: it is given to mankind as a task to be carried out with the
help
of divine grace. It is entrusted to man and woman, in the Sacrament of
Matrimony, as the basic principle of their "duty", and it becomes
the foundation of their mutual responsibility: first as spouses, then
as
father and mother. In the celebration of the Sacrament, the spouses
give
and receive each other, declaring their willingness to welcome children
and to educate them. On this hinges human civilization, which cannot be
defined as anything other than a "civilization of love".</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The family is an expression and source
of this love. <i style="font-weight: bold;">Through the
family passes the primary current of the civilization of love, </i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">which
finds therein its "social foundations".</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The Fathers of the Church, in the
Christian tradition, have spoken of
the family as a "domestic church", a "little church".
They thus referred to the civilization of love as a possible system of
human life and coexistence: "to be together" as a family, to
be for one another, to make room in a community for affirming each
person
as such, for affirming "this" individual person. At times it
is a matter of people with physical or psychological handicaps, of whom
the so-called "progressive" society would prefer to be free.
Even the family can end up like this kind of society. It does so when
it
hastily rids itself of people who are aged, disabled or sick. This
happens
when there is a loss of faith in that <i>God for whom "all live"
</i>(cf. <i>Lk </i>20:38) and are called to the fullness of Life.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Yes, <i>the civilization of love is
possible; it is not a utopia.</i>
But it is only possible by a constant and ready reference to the
"Father
from whom all fatherhood 1 on earth is named" (cf. <i>Eph</i>
3:14-15),
from whom every human family comes.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>Education</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">16. <i>What is involved in raising
children? </i>In answering this question
two fundamental truths should be kept in mind: first, that man is
called
to live in truth and love; and second, that everyone finds fulfilment
through
the sincere gift of self. This is true both for the educator and for
the
one being educated. Education is thus a unique process for which the
mutual
communion of persons has immense importance. <i>The educator </i>is a
person
who<i> "begets" in a spiritual sense. </i>From this point of
view, <i>raising children can be considered a genuine apostolate. </i>It
is a living means of communication, which not only creates a profound
relationship
between the educator and the one being educated, but also makes them
both
sharers in truth and love, that final goal to which everyone is called
by God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">. . . .<br>
If it is true that by giving life <i>parents </i>share in God's
creative
work, it is also true that by raising their children they <i>become
sharers
in his paternal and at the same time maternal way of teaching. </i>According
to Saint Paul, God's fatherhood is the primordial model of all
fatherhood
and motherhood in the universe (cf. <i>Eph </i>3:14-15), and of human
motherhood
and fatherhood in particular. We have been completely instructed in
God's
own way of teaching by the eternal Word of the Father who, by becoming
man, revealed to man the authentic and integral greatness of his
humanity,
that is, being a child of God. In this way he also revealed the true
meaning
of human education. <i>Through Christ </i>all education, within the
family
and outside of it, <i>becomes part of God's own saving pedagogy, </i>which
is addressed to individuals and families and culminates in the Paschal
Mystery of the Lord's Death and Resurrection. The "heart" of
our redemption is the starting-point of every process of Christian
education,
which is likewise always an education to a full humanity.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><i>Parents </i>are <i>the first and
most important educators </i>of
their own children, and they also possess a <i>fundamental competence </i>in
this area: they are <i>educators because they are parents. </i>They
share
their educational mission with other individuals or institutions, such
as the Church and the State. But the mission of education must always
be
carried out in accordance with a proper application of the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: bold;">principle
of subsidiarity</span>. </i>This implies the legitimacy and indeed the
need of
giving assistance to the parents, but finds its intrinsic and absolute
limit in their prevailing right and their actual capabilities. The
principle
of subsidiarity is thus at the service of parental love, meeting the
good
of the family unit. For parents by themselves are not capable of
satisfying
every requirement of the whole process of raising children, especially
in matters concerning their schooling and the entire gamut of
socialization.
Subsidiarity thus complements paternal and maternal love and confirms
its
fundamental nature, inasmuch as all other participants in the process
of
education are only able to carry out their responsibilities <i>in the
name
of the parents, with their consent</i> and, to a certain degree, <i>with
their authorization.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">. . . . <br>
The <i>gospel of love </i>is the inexhaustible source of all that
nourishes
the human family as a "communion of persons". In love the whole
educational process finds its support and definitive meaning as the
mature
fruit of the parents' mutual gift. Through the efforts, sufferings and
disappointments which are part of every person's education, love is
constantly
being put to the test. To pass the test, a source of spiritual strength
is necessary. This is only found in the One who "loved to the end"
(<i>Jn </i>13:1). Thus <i>education is fully a part of the
"civilization
of love". </i>It depends on the civilization of love and, in great
measure, contributes to its upbuilding.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The Church's constant and trusting
prayer during the Year of the Family
is <i>for the education of man, </i>so that families will persevere
in
their task of education with courage, trust and hope, in spite of
difficulties
occasionally so serious as to appear insuperable. The Church prays that
the forces of the "civilization of love", which have their source
in the love of God, will be triumphant. These are forces which the
Church
ceaselessly expends for the good of the whole human family.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><i>Family and society</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">17. The family is a community of persons
and the smallest social unit.
As such it is an <i style="font-weight: bold;">institution </i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fundamental to the life of every society.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">What does the family as an institution
expect from society? First of
all, it expects <i>a recognition of its identity </i>and an
acceptance
of its <i>status as a subject in society. </i>This "social
subjectivity"
is bound up with the proper identity of marriage and the family.
Marriage,
which undergirds the institution of the family, is constituted by the
covenant
whereby "a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership
of their whole life", and which "of its own very nature is ordered
to the well-being of the spouses and to the procreation and upbringing
of children". Only such a union can be recognized and ratified as
a "marriage" in society. Other interpersonal unions which do
not fulfil the above conditions cannot be recognized, despite certain
growing
trends which represent a serious threat to the future of the family and
of society itself.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">No human society can run the risk of
permissiveness in fundamental issues
regarding the nature of marriage and the family! Such moral
permissiveness
cannot fail to damage the authentic requirements of peace and communion
among people. It is thus quite understandable why the Church vigorously
defends the identity of the family and encourages responsible
individuals
and institutions, especially political leaders and international
organizations,
not to yield to the temptation of a superficial and false modernity.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">As a community of love and life, the
family is a firmly grounded social
reality. It is also, in a way entirely its own, a <i>sovereign
society,
</i>albeit conditioned in certain ways. This affirmation of the
family's
sovereignty as an institution and the recognition of the various ways
in
which it is conditioned naturally leads to the subject of <i>family
rights.
</i>In this regard, the Holy See published in 1983 the <i>Charter of
the
Rights of the Family; </i>even today this document has lost none of
its
relevance.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The rights of the family are closely <i>linked
to the rights of the
person: </i>if in fact the family is a communion of persons, its
self-realization
will depend in large part on the correct application of the rights of
its
members. Some of these rights concern the family in an immediate way,
such
as the right of parents to responsible procreation and the education of
children. Other rights however touch the family unit only indirectly:
among
these, the right to property, especially to what is called family
property,
and the right to work are of special importance.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">But the rights of the family <i>are not
simply the sum total </i>of
the rights of the person, since the family is <i>much more </i>than
the
sum of its individual members. It is a community of parents and
children,
and at times a community of several generations. For this reason its
"status
as a subject", which is grounded in God's plan, gives rise to and
calls for certain proper and specific rights. <i>The Charter of the
Rights
of the Family, </i>on the basis of the moral principles mentioned
above,
consolidates the existence of the institution of the family in the
social
and juridical order of the "greater" society&#8212;those of the nation,
of the State and of international communities. Each of these "greater"
societies is at least indirectly conditioned by the existence of the
family.
As a result, the definition of the rights and duties of the "greater"
society with regard to the family is an extremely important and even
essential
issue.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In the first place there is<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> the almost organic link existing between
</span><i><span style="font-weight: bold;">the family and the nation</span>.
</i>Naturally we cannot speak in all cases
about a nation in the proper sense. Ethnic groups still exist which,
without
being able to be considered true nations, do fulfil to some extent the
function of a "greater" society. In both cases, the link of the
family with the ethnic group or the nation is founded above all on <i>a
participation in its culture.</i> In one sense, parents also give birth
to children for the nation, so that they can be members of it and can
share
in its historic and cultural heritage. From the very outset the
identity
of the family is to some extent shaped by the identity of the nation to
which it belongs.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">By sharing in the nation's cultural
heritage, the family contributes
to that <i>specific sovereignty, </i>which has its origin in a
distinct
culture and language. I addressed this subject at the UNESCO Conference
meeting in Paris in 1980, and, given its unquestionable importance, I
have
often returned to it. Not only the nations, but every family realizes
its
<i>spiritual sovereignty</i> through culture and language. Were this
not
true, it would be very difficult to explain many events in the history
of peoples, especially in Europe. From these events, ancient and
modern,
inspiring and painful, glorious and humiliating, it becomes clear how
much
the family is an organic part of the nation, and the nation of the
family.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In regard to the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">State,
</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">the link with the family is
somewhat
similar and at the same time somewhat dissimila</span>r. The State, in
fact, is
distinct from the nation; it has a less "family-like" structure,
since it is organized in accordance with a political system and in a
more
"bureaucratic" fashion. Nonetheless, the apparatus of the State
also has, in some sense, a "soul" of its own, to the extent that
it lives up to its nature as a "political community" juridically
ordered towards the common good. Closely linked to this "soul"
is the family, which is connected with the State precisely by reason of
the <i>principle of subsidiarity.</i> Indeed, the family is a social
reality
which does not have readily available all the means necessary to carry
out its proper ends, also in matters regarding schooling and the
rearing
of children. The State is thus called upon to play a role in accordance
with the principle mentioned above. Whenever the family is
self-sufficient,
it should be left to act on its own; an excessive intrusiveness on the
part of the State would prove detrimental, to say nothing of lacking
due
respect, and would constitute an open violation of the rights of the
family.
Only in those situations where the family is not really self-sufficient
does the State have the authority and duty to intervene.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Beyond child-rearing and schooling at
all levels, State assistance,
while not excluding private initiatives, can find expression in
institutions
such as those founded to safeguard the life and health of citizens, and
in particular to provide social benefits for workers. <i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Unemployment</span> </i>is
today one of the most serious threats to family life and a rightful
cause
of concern to every society. It represents a challenge for the
political
life of individual States and an area for careful study in the Church's
social doctrine. It is urgently necessary, therefore, to come up with
courageous
solutions capable of looking beyond the confines of one's own nation
and
taking into consideration the many families for whom lack of employment
means living in situations of tragic poverty.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">While speaking about employment in
reference to the family, it is appropriate
to emphasize how important and burdensome is <i>the work women do
within
the family unit:</i> <i>that work should be acknowledged and deeply
appreciated.
</i>The "toil" of a woman who, having given birth to a child,
nourishes and cares for that child and devotes herself to its
upbringing,
particularly in the early years, is so great as to be comparable to any
professional work. This ought to be clearly stated and upheld, no less
than any other labour right. Motherhood, because of all the hard work
it
entails, should be recognized as giving the right to financial benefits
at least equal to those of other kinds of work undertaken in order to
support
the family during such a delicate phase of its life.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Every effort should be made so that the
family will be recognized as
the <i>primordial </i>and, in a certain sense "sovereign<i>"
society! </i><span style="font-weight: bold;">The "sovereignty" of the
family is essential for
the good of society.</span> A truly sovereign and spiritually vigorous
nation
is always made up of strong families who are aware of their vocation
and
mission in history. <i>The family is at the heart</i> of all these
problems
and tasks. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To relegate it to a
subordinate or secondary role, excluding
it from its rightful position in society, would be to inflict grave
harm
on the authentic growth of society as a whole</span>.</font></p>
