<b><font size=+2>I-II.27.1: WHETHER GOOD IS
THE ONLY CAUSE OF LOVE?</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b>Objection 1.</b> It would seem that good is not the only cause of
love. For good does not cause love, except because it is loved. But it
happens that evil also is loved, according to Ps. 10:6: "He that loveth
iniquity, hateth his own soul": else, every love would be good. Therefore
good is not the only cause of love.
<p><b>Objection 3.</b> Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that not
"the good" only but also "the beautiful is beloved by all."
<p><b>On the contrary,</b> Augustine says (De Trin. viii, 3): "Assuredly
the good alone is beloved." Therefore good alone is the cause of love.
<p><b>I answer that,</b> As stated above (26, 1), Love belongs to the appetitive
power which is a passive faculty. Wherefore its object stands in relation
to it as the cause of its movement or act. Therefore the cause of love
must needs be love's object. Now the proper object of love is the good;
because, as stated above (26, 1,2), love implies a certain connaturalness
or complacency of the lover for the thing beloved, and to everything, that
thing is a good, which is akin and proportionate to it. It follows, therefore,
that good is the proper cause of love.
<p><b>Reply to Objection 1.</b> Evil is never loved except under the aspect
of good, that is to say, in so far as it is good in some respect, and is
considered as being good simply. And thus a certain love is evil, in so
far as it tends to that which is not simply a true good. It is in this
way that man "loves iniquity," inasmuch as, by means of iniquity, some
good is gained; pleasure, for instance, or money, or such like.
<p><b>Reply to Objection 3.</b> The beautiful is the same as the good,
and they differ in aspect only. For since good is what all seek, the notion
of good is that which calms the desire; while the notion of the beautiful
is that which calms the desire, by being seen or known. Consequently those
senses chiefly regard the beautiful, which are the most cognitive, viz.
sight and hearing, as ministering to reason; for we speak of beautiful
sights and beautiful sounds. But in reference to the other objects of the
other senses, we do not use the expression "beautiful," for we do not speak
of beautiful tastes, and beautiful odors. Thus it is evident that beauty
adds to goodness a relation to the cognitive faculty: so that "good" means
that which simply pleases the appetite; while the "beautiful" is something
pleasant to apprehend.

<p><b><font size=+2>I-II.27.3: WHETHER LIKENESS IS A CAUSE OF LOVE?</font></b>
<p>OBJ 1: It would seem that likeness is not a cause of love. For the same
thing is not the cause of contraries. But likeness is the cause of hatred;
for it is written (Prov. 13:10) that "among the proud there are always
contentions"; and the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 1) that "potters quarrel
with one another." Therefore likeness is not a cause of love.
<p>OBJ 2: Further, Augustine says (Confess. iv, 14) that "a man loves in
another that which he would not be himself: <b>Thus</b> he loves an actor,
but would not himself be an actor." But it would not be so, if likeness
were the proper cause of love; for in that case a man would love in another,
that which he possesses himself, or would like to possess. Therefore likeness
is not a cause of love.
<p>OBJ 3: Further, everyone loves that which he needs, even if he have
it not: <b>Thus</b> a sick man loves health, and a poor man loves riches.
But in so far as he needs them and lacks them, he is unlike them. Therefore
not only likeness but also unlikeness is a cause of love.
<p>OBJ 4: Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "we love those
who bestow money and health on us; and also those who retain their friendship
for the dead." But all are not such. Therefore likeness is not a cause
of love.
<p><i>On the contrary,</i> It is written (Ecclus. 13:19): "Every beast
loveth its like."
<p><i>I answer that,</i> Likeness, properly speaking, is a cause of love.
But it must be observed that likeness between things is twofold. One kind
of likeness arises from each thing having the same quality actually: for
example, two things possessing the quality of whiteness are said to be
alike. Another kind of likeness arises from one thing having potentially
and by way of inclination, a quality which the other has actually: <b>Thus</b>
we may say that a heavy body existing outside its proper place is like
another heavy body that exists in its proper place: or again, according
as potentiality bears a resemblance to its act; <b>since</b> act is contained,
in a manner, in the potentiality itself.
<p>Accordingly the first kind of likeness causes <i>love-of-friendship</i>
or well-being. For the very fact that two men are alike, having, as it
were, one form, makes them to be, in a manner, one in that form: <b>Thus</b>
two men are one thing in the species of humanity, and two white men are
one thing in whiteness. <b>Hence</b> the affections of one tend to the
other, as being one with him; and he wishes good to him as to himself.
But the second kind of likeness causes <i>love-of-concupiscence</i>, or
friendship founded on usefulness or pleasure: <b>because</b> whatever is
in potentiality, as such, has the desire for its act; and it takes pleasure
in its realization, if it be a sentient and cognitive being.
<p>Now it has been stated above (Q26, A4), that in the <i>love-of-concupiscence</i>,
the lover, properly speaking, loves himself, in willing the good that he
desires. But a man loves himself more than another: <b>because</b> he is
one with himself substantially, whereas with another he is one only in
the likeness of some form. <b>Consequently</b>, if this other's likeness
to him arising from the participation of a form, hinders him from gaining
the good that he loves, he becomes hateful to him, not for being like him,
but for hindering him from gaining his own good. This is why "potters quarrel
among themselves," <b>because</b> they hinder one another's gain: and why
"there are contentions among the proud," <b>because</b> they hinder one
another in attaining the position they covet.
<p><b>Hence</b> the Reply to the First Objection is evident.
<p>Reply OBJ 2: Even when a man loves in another what he loves not in himself,
there is a certain likeness of proportion: <b>because</b> as the latter
is to that which is loved in him, so is the former to that which he loves
in himself: for instance, if a good singer love a good writer, we can see
a likeness of proportion, inasmuch as each one has that which is becoming
to him in respect of his art.
<p>Reply OBJ 3: He that loves what he needs, bears a likeness to what he
loves, as potentiality bears a likeness to its act, as stated above.
<p>Reply OBJ 4: According to the same likeness of potentiality to its act,
the illiberal man loves the man who is liberal, in so far as he expects
from him something which he desires. The same applies to the man who is
constant in his friendship as compared to one who is inconstant. For in
either case friendship seems to be based on usefulness. We might also say
that although not all men have these virtues in the complete habit, yet
they have them according to certain seminal principles in the reason, in
force of which principles the man who is not virtuous loves the virtuous
man, as being in conformity with his own natural reason.
