<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Part One: Natural Law's Nature,
History and Current Status</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The earliest written reference to the natural moral law, that I know of
[within the Greco-Roman west<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>], was 2500
years ago, when an ancient Athenian [Sophocles] wrote the play "Antigone"
around 441 B.C. In this play, Antigone defied an unjust law and said this
in explanation:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Neither Zeus nor Justice,
dweller with the Nether Gods, gave such a law to men; nor did I deem your
ordinance of so much binding force, as that a mortal man could overbear
the unchangeable unwritten code of Heaven. This is not of today and yesterday,
but lives for ever, having origin whence no man knows.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>This quote shows that natural law originated
as a moral law binding all--including rulers and the not-always-good ancient
Greek gods. Desires--even of the most powerful--were thereby bound by the
good. Herein lay the ancient Greek answer to Plato's Euthyphro question:
Is it good because it is desired or desired because it is good? Plato's
contribution to natural law was that goodness is the supreme value that
made all intelligible; this linked morality to intelligibility and rationality.
Thus, the ancient Greek formulations of natural law bestowed upon it four
basic characteristics, namely, (1) universality, (2) indefeasibility, (3)
rationality, and, (4) the ability to void unjust laws. As a result, moral
obligations were indispensable and binding upon all.</font></font>
<br><font size=-1><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although these four characteristics endured through time, their distinguishing
features have not remain constant. The ancient Roman Stoics, who were responsible
for bequeathing the idea of natural law both to medieval and Renaissance
thinkers, argued that natural law was an expression of universal and divine
reason. St. Paul, whose hometown (Tarsus) was a Stoic center, wrote not
only that creation reveals a Supreme Being and His Law but that this law
is written in the human heart (Rom. 1: 19-20 and 2:15). That the Creator
was the ultimate source of natural law became central to Christianity's
characterization of natural law. Aquinas, who is perhaps the definitive
natural law theorist, defined the natural law as the human participation
through reason in God's eternal law.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>
This definition enabled Aquinas to preserve the Divine origin of natural
law by linking human nature to the Creator, while identifying the indefeasibility
and universality of natural law with a rationally undeniable first principle,
namely, this one: "Good is to be done and pursued while evil is to be avoided."
This precept, called the <i>Bonum Precept, </i>also enabled Aquinas to
identify the full intelligibility of goodness with happiness, thereby characterizing
natural law norms as the maxims of human joy and flourishing.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup></font><font face="Arial Bold">Aquinas
also identified the Decalogue proscriptions of harming others in thought,
word and deed as well as the Decalogue prescriptions of honoring God and
parents as the central precepts of morality. He also argued--as I argue
in the book I'm finishing up---that the obligations to love God above all
and to love neighbors as oneself are the primary precepts of both natural
law and faith. This grounding of natural law in love, however, was not
continued by the natural law tradition, even though every tradition has,
in some form, the obligation to treat others as one would be treated. In
any case, the Greco-Latin tradition culminated by adding three additional
characteristics to the Greek basic four, namely, that natural law principles
are written on the human heart by God; that the happiness of human flourishing
is the end of morality; and that others are not to be harmed in thought,
word or deed. (This last characteristic forbids, for example, racist thoughts,
bearing false witness and murder).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the Greco-Latin period, natural law continued to influence the international
laws pertaining to war. Particularly helpful in preserving and enhancing
the Greco-Latin tradition were a Spanish Thomist,<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup>
who argued that the Native Americans of the New World could not be conquered
with impunity; and, Hugo Grotius (1583-1645), who wrote the three volume
masterpiece <i>On the Law of War and Peace</i>. In this regard, it is perhaps
important to note that the history of morally constraining the acts of
war stretches back through the dawn of recorded history--as argued by Leon
Friedman (1972, 3):</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Virtually every civilization
of which we have record placed some limitations on the conduct of its own
warfare. As early as the Egyptian and Sumerian wars of the second millennium
B.C., there were rules . . . In his famous book <i>The Art of War</i>,
written in the fourth century B.C., Sun Tzu noted that it was forbidden
to injure an enemy previously wounded . . . . . About the same time, the
Hindu civilization in neighboring India produced a body of rules (found
in the Book of Manu) . . .[containing] the following: '. . .let him not
strike with weapons concealed (in wood), nor . . . bared, poisoned, or
the points of which are blazing with fire. Let him not strike one . . .
who is disarmed, nor one who looks on without taking part in the fight
. . .nor one whose weapons are broken . . .nor one who has turned to flight;
(but in all these cases let him) remember the duty (of honorable warriors).'
. . . . The Babylonians of the seventh century B.C., also treated prisoners
and captured peoples with restraint in accordance with well-established
rules.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>In contemporary times, international
agreements about the morality of war acts began with the 1868 Declaration
of St. Petersburg (which proscribed "the employment of arms which uselessly
aggravate the sufferings of disabled men, or render their death inevitable,
. . . [including explosive or fulminating or inflammable projectiles of
less than 400 grams]);" <sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup> and with the
1874 Brussels Declaration (which denied an unlimited right to injure the
enemy, forbade attacking or bombing open and undefended towns, and required
the humane treatment of prisoners).<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup> Such
proscriptions were included in the 1899 and 1907 Conventions of The Hague
Peace Conferences, the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
In addition, there are various resolutions of the United Nations' General
Assembly, namely, the 1961 Resolution Number 1653 on Nuclear Weapons, the
1968 Resolution # 2444 on Human Rights, the 1970 Resolution # 2675 on the
Protection of Civilians.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup> These resolutions
and agreements honor the natural law by seeking to minimize the harms unavoidable
in war.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Natural law also became---for a while---influential within political philosophy.
The almost virtual disappearance of natural law influence within political
philosophy may not seem surprising given the current popularity of utilitarianism,
moral relativism, and legal positivism. Nevertheless, it seems to me somewhat
surprising, given that natural law enabled the diverse peoples of the world
to unite and support the United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, a document described by the Pope as ". . .one of the highest
expressions of the human conscience of our time."<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup>
Natural law as specifically expressed by Aquinas also provided the theoretical
context for the nonviolent civil disobedience practiced by Martin Luther
King Jr. and his followers. Natural law also played an indispensable role
in establishing a country still in existence today, namely, the United
States of America. That natural law with all of its seven characteristics
was indeed the basis of the American political system and can be seen in
her foundational document, the Declaration of Independence.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup></font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>When in the course of
human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political
bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers
of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature
and of nature's god entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are
instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these
ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute
new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
safety and happiness."</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>This rather lengthy quotation not
only enables us to follow the Pope's 1995 exhortation<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>
to reclaim the insights of American culture, but it also enables us to
note that the Declaration of Independence advances the Greco-Latin characteristics
of natural law while including an emphasis upon the unalienable rights
of life and liberty. In this regard, our country's founders were most insightful.
For life and liberty are mutually interdependent: without freedom, human
life cannot express the human heart; and without life, freedom lacks a
criterion to avoid the harm that is so destructive of freedom. Indeed,
life and liberty are foundational goods both for morality and for political
systems. In fact, they are so foundational that apart from them, neither
morality or politics is possible. This is because both morality and politics
presuppose the existence of values; and, values presuppose life and liberty.
Ayn Rand (<i>The Objectivist Ethics,
</i>15-6) explains:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>"Value" is that which
one acts to gain and/or keep. The concept "value" is not a primary; it
presupposes an answer to the question: of value to <i>whom</i> and for
<i>what?</i>
It presupposes an entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face
of an alternative. Where no alternative exists, no goals and no values
are possible. . . .There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe:
existence or nonexistence--and it pertains to a single class of entities;
to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional,
the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action.
Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to
exist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative:
the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generating
action. If an organism fails in that action, it dies . . .It is only the
concept of "Life" that makes the concept of "Value" possible. It is only
to a living entity that things can be good or evil.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Since values presuppose life, death
cannot be a value; it can never be, in itself, good. When we say, with
tears in our eyes, that a friend is better off dead, what we mean is that
it is good that he suffers no more. We are not speaking precisely but emotionally;
and so, we commit a category mistake and call death good.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Values not only presuppose life, but they also presuppose rational choice
and the need for a moral code. Once again, Ayn Rand explains:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[<i>The Objectivists
Ethics, </i>22] Man is not exempt from the laws of reality, he is a specific
organism of a specific nature that requires specific actions to sustain
his life. . . .That which his survival requires is set by his nature and
is not open to his choice. What is open to his choice is only whether he
will discover it or not, whether he will choose the right goals and values
or not. He is free to make the wrong choice, but not free to succeed with
it. . . .[25] Man has to be man by choice--and it is the task of ethics
to teach him how to live like man."</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>To live like man, to live like a
human being is to <i>choose</i> to live in accordance with the truths known
by reason. Freedom lies in acting rationally; happiness lies in being good.
So says the ancient Greeks and Romans. So says the Christians. So says
the natural law tradition. So says Ayn Rand. So says the American tradition
of natural law as found in the Declaration of Independence. So says the
Geneva Conventions and the U.N.'s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">Not so, says the postmodern. Not so, says current
American pop culture. As Billy Joel sings: I rather laugh with the sinners
than cry with the saints. Goodness is boring. Wickedness is fun. Freedom
is best experienced in defying moral norms; hence, for example, the American
sexual revolution was first marketed as "free love." Natural law died within
American pop culture, when that culture succumbed to the lies of youthful
rebelliousness, that is to the beliefs that freedom is willfulness, and
that happiness is capriciousness. These lies were first told in the Garden
of Eden, when Satin promised that eating of the Tree of Good and Evil would
free human beings from having to recognize what it good and evil and enable
them to designate as good and evil whatever they wanted;<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup>
in the words of <i>Genesis</i>: You would be as Gods. And, in the words
of <i>Fides et Ratio</i>:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n.80]: The problem of
moral evil--the most tragic of evil's forms--is also addressed in the Bible,
which tells us that such evil stems not from any material deficiency, but
is a wound inflicted by the disordered exercise of human freedom. . . .
. [n.22]: The symbol is clear: man was in no position to discern and decide
for himself what was good and what was evil, but was constrained to appeal
to a higher source.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>And so, we enter into the mystery
of cultural decay and immorality: evil is always rooted, as Aquinas points
out, <sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup> in the choice to reject the truths
known by reason. If this were not so, then immorality would be impossible
because it would be impossible for any free choice to be wrong.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is yet another argument that freedom cannot be wilfulness and happiness
cannot be capriciousness. The heart of this argument is the now controversial
claim that freedom is dependent on truth. This claim, often made by John
Paul II, <sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup> is so basic that upon it
rests the validity as well as the vitality of the natural moral law. Thus,
it behooves us to pause and seek to understand why there is no freedom
without truth. Today, I have two additional arguments for you. The first
concerns personal freedom and the second political freedom.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First argument begins with the nature of human action. Human action occurs
as an expression of desire; we do not act for what we do not desire; we
are goal-directed beings. This means that choice cannot create desires
but only channel them.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup> If nothing is
desired, choice is not, as it were, activated. Since this is so, the question
becomes what is necessary for desire? Desires have directions for objects
that have the potential to satisfy desire. Desires are directed towards
ends. Must these ends be real--must they be really able to satisfy desire?
If so, then knowing the truth about various possible ends is necessary.
For example, which oxygen tank will provide the air necessary while swimming
underwater? Better find out the truth about those gauges: what do they
read? Can they be trusted? One more example, suppose that there is a black
box that electronically stimulates human brains so that they experience
intense pleasure. Would we sign up for the experience? Perhaps, as a lark.
But would we do it, if it were irreversible? Is it even desirable to spend
a lifetime experiencing the pleasures of a black box? I think not. Desires
are not for the illusionary but for the real. Hence, desires presuppose
truth. And, if desires presuppose truth, then the freedom of deciding which
desire to satisfy also presupposes truth.</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">Why does freedom presuppose truth? Here is the
second argument from the nature of political freedom. Political freedom
presupposes that citizens respect rather than fear each other. Respect
for the other, according to Aquinas, requires--at very least----caring
about the other's good to the extent that harm is never willed to the other.
Since whatever is contrary to the physical, social or spiritual life of
another is harmful, there are objective standards of harm that freedom
must honor. As the Pope wrote in <i>Veritatis Splendor</i>:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>n 13.2: In this commandment
[love thy neighbor as thyself], we find a precise expression of the singular
dignity of the human person, "the only creature that God has wanted for
its own sake." The different commandments of the Decalogue are really only
so many reflections of the one commandment about the good of the person
at the level of many different goods which characterize his identity as
a spiritual and bodily being, in relationship with God, with his neighbor
and with the material world. . . . . [13.4]: The commandments thus represent
the basic condition for love of neighbor . . . .They are the first necessary
step on the journey toward freedom, its starting point. "The beginning
of freedom," St. Augustine writes, "is to be free from crimes . . .such
as murder, adultery, fornication, theft, fraud, sacrilege and so forth."
[n.17.2] The follower of Christ knows that his vocation is to freedom.
(See Gal. 5:13).</font></font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>In the absence of truth, there
are no standards for acting humanely; as a result, harm is done and fear
becomes widespread. As the Pope wrote in <i>The Gospel of Life (Evangelium
Vitae</i> 1995 n.20.3):</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>To claim the right to
abortion, infanticide and euthanasia, and to recognize that right in law,
means to attribute to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: that
of an absolute power over others and against others. This is the death
of true freedom."</font></font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>It is the death of true freedom,
and of natural law, because any power that denigrates human life harms
human beings. This is especially the case when human freedom and happiness
is identified with caprice, because caprice unleashes such threats to human
life that the largest tribe or gang will think there is no alternative,
but to enter into a political unity ruled by those powerful enough to secure
their safety by eliminating freedom, especially the freedom of religious
belief--as Jacques Rousseau argued long ago. Within such a system, questions
of truth and happiness are replaced by the pragmatics of personal security
and physical well-being. Such repression of truth and freedom is not the
American way--as shown by the emphasis upon the rights of life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness expressed by the
<i>Declaration of Independence</i>
as well as by those rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">Nevertheless, the lie that truth and certitude
undermine both freedom and happiness is so prevalent within American pop
culture that the question arises about whether the end of this millennium
will also be the end of natural law. <i>On the one hand</i>, it seems that
natural law is dead and cannot be resurrected: its seven basic characteristics
have become alien concepts. For example, nature no longer seems to be the
handiwork of God: science has made nature less a thing of wonder than an
object of dissection. Science has also, through its shifting paradigms
and the influence of Kuhn's <i>The Structures of Scientific Revolutions</i>,
combined with American pragmatism, agnosticism, and ethical relativism
to make certitude (and, thereby, the universality and indefeasibility of
natural law) seem naive and narrowminded. As a result, reason itself seems
to be presumptuous: there is no intelligibility to life; it is rather meaningless.
To be cynical and pessimistic is to be cool; love--true love--is an illusion;
and, beauty is to be scorned (hence, the popularity of body-piercing, tatoos
and the grunge-look).</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">If we move beyond pop culture to the culture at
large, these elements are still present: they drive consumerism (if one
has the latest gadget, one can be neither uncool nor without value). Consumerism
focuses one's attention upon acquiring more and more money thereby identifying
efficiency and productivity as core values. When these values become ingrained
within a culture, others become viewed either as promoting or hindering
one's efficiency and productivity; they are no longer respected as their
own ends: only the self's ends or goals count. At this point, technology
becomes valued only in relation to the ends of its users and not in relation
to whether it is enabling life to become more humane. Fear of technology
thus makes sense, since technology in the wrong hands enslaves or kills.
"Man," writes the Pope in <i>Dives Misericordia</i> [p.34], "rightly fears
falling victim to an oppression that will deprive him of his interior freedom
. . ." And, he warns in <i>Fides et Ratio</i>: [n. 81]"If . . . technology
is not ordered to something greater than a merely utilitarian end, then
it could soon prove inhuman and even become a potential destroyer of the
human race."<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup> Accordingly, America---as
the technological society par excellence--undercuts its natural law heritage
to the degree that its culture becomes driven by consumerism and utilitarianism.
From this perspective, natural law is either dead or dying; it is now conceivable
that the natural moral law could become as irrelevant as the ancient Greek
and Roman religions. But if the United States betrays its natural law foundation,
then we will lose the confidence that reasonable people of good will can
work out their differences as well as the universal moral code that made
such confidence realistic by establishing the obligation not to harm the
weak. We cannot afford to lose our natural law heritage. Is there any reason
for hope? Is natural law theory about to perish from the face of the earth?</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=+1>Part Two: Grounds for Hope</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are two grounds for hope. The first is that, as St. Paul wrote in
Romans 2:15, the moral law is indelibly written within the human heart.
Indeed, as Aquinas pointed out, all know that they are obligated to do
good and avoid evil; and, as I argue in the book I'm finishing up, all
also know that neighbors should be loved as oneself and that God--if He
exists--should be loved above all. The problem is that we are now faced
with a generation that is so confused about the fundamentals that they
are unsure of whether God exists and whether every human being is a neighbor.
This generation also is so confused about the nature of good and evil that
they do not recognize that life is always good and that the suffering need
loving care---not poison! A generation that cannot value life is a generation
that has lost the criterion of identifying what is harmful to human beings
and have thereby voided their ability to apply universally known maxims
to specify particular acts. Accordingly, assisted suicide, for example,
can be promoted as a loving act: love is no longer life-enhancing. Once
life is lost as a basic human good, natural law unravels as a coherent
system. This means that we may well be witnessing the total collapse of
the natural law context that has underwritten this country's political
philosophy for over two hundred years and western civilization's morality
for over two thousand years. So, it seems that our first ground of hope
is not very strong and warrants a great deal of worry and fear.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the Pope says, "Fear not." We ask: Why not? Here is the explanation
he gave to the United Nations in 1995:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n. 16-17]: We must learn
not to be afraid, we must rediscover a spirit of hope and a spirit of trust.
Hope is not empty optimism springing from a naive confidence that the future
will necessarily be better than the past. Hope and trust are the premise
of responsible activity and are nurtured in that inner sanctuary of conscience
where "man is alone with God" (Gaudium et Spes, 16) and he thus perceives
that he is not alone amid the enigmas of existence, for he is surrounded
by the love of the Creator! . . .the destiny of all nations lies in the
hands of a merciful Providence.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>In other words, it is our faith that
sustains our hope. We can trust our heavenly Father will not abandon us;
He will make all things new; and He has placed all under the maternal protection
of His own son's mother. That protection is a great comfort: mothers thwart
harm very effectively. And, ". . .Mary," writes the Pope in his 1990 <i>Redemptoris
Missio [n.92.3]</i>, "is the model of that maternal love which should inspire
all who cooperate in the Church's apostolic mission for the rebirth of
humanity." So, a rebirth of humanity is coming. When it comes it will necessarily
be linked with a renewal of natural law because the rules for treating
each other humanely and for being happy are within natural law and its
two great principles: always love thy neighbor as thyself and always love
God above all.</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">Thus, the question is not whether things will
improve but when?</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">The Pope has consistently expressed much hope
that this century has been preparing for a "rebirth of humanity" linked
to a "great springtime for Christianity." Here are his words from <i>Redemptoris
Missio </i>[86.1]:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>As the third millennium
of the Redemption draws near, God is preparing a great springtime for Christianity,
and we can already see its first signs [in the rejection of war and violence,
the respect for human rights, the desire for freedom, the justice and brotherhood,
the surmounting of racism and nationalism, and the affirmation of the dignity
and role of women].</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>The coming Christian springtime will
rebirth humanity, because, the natural law principles obligating love of
others and God are also the principles of Christian action.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Furthermore, as the Pope says in <i>Fides et Ratio</i> [n.12] through the
Incarnation, "God takes on a human face." This means that, on the one hand,
the world cannot be more humane, without also becoming more Christlike;
and, on the other hand, the world cannot be more Christlike, without also
becoming more humane. Mother Teresa of Calcutta proves that this is the
case. The path of being humane, of being kind to one another is true to
Christ--and it is Church's current mission. As the Pope writes in <i>Dives
in Misericordia</i></font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n.14.7]: Certainly,
the Second Vatican Council also leads us in this direction, when it speaks
repeatedly of the need to <i>make the world more human</i>,<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>
and says that the realization of this task is precisely the mission of
the Church in the modern world.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Essential to this mission is the
realization that Christ is the model human being. "Christ," as the Pope
often repeats, "reveals man to himself."<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup>
This revelation is not only about being human and caring for humans but
also about being in relation to the truth. The Cross thus speaks volumes
to the nonChristian:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Dives in Misericordia
[7.4]: "The suffering Christ speaks in a special way to man, and not only
to the believer. The non-believer also will be able to discover in Him
the eloquence of solidarity with the human lot, as also the harmonious
fullness of a disinterested dedication to the cause of man, to truth and
to love.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>In other words, the world cannot
but notice that the Christian God is motivated by the love of truth and
human beings. <sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup> Since this is so, a
Christian springtime cannot but promote human beings and the natural law
that obligates loving them.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That this is the case can also been seen by the emphasis upon toleration
found in the Pope's 1995 speech to the United Nations. "Faith in Christ,"
the Pope said, "does not impel us to intolerance." That Christianity obligates
tolerance is rather shocking for those Americans who have heard, over and
over again, our cultural elites tell us that truth causes the certitude
that breeds intolerance, and so, lack of certitude---especially in morality
and religion---is crucial for the survival of civilization. But this is
a lie: there are two certitudes, one of philosophy and one of Christianity,
which necessitate toleration. The philosophical certitude is that human
beliefs can never be coerced: it is not possible to force one to believe
what one knows to be false. Hence, the cause of truth is only promoted
when another's intelligence and freedom is respected. The Christian certitude
that promotes toleration is that the human face of God requires every human
face to be respected and treated with dignity. These foundations of Christian
tolerance characterize it not as a negative virtue of selectively ignoring
what is different from oneself, but as a positive virtue of extending consideration
for the other. This means that tolerance cannot be divorced from listening
and dialoguing with the other. As John Paul II writes in <i>Redemptoris
Missio</i> 1990:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n.56.1]: Dialogue is
demanded by deep respect for everything that has been brought about in
human beings by the Spirit who blows where He wills. [n. 57.2]: Each member
of the faithful and all Christian communities are called to practice dialogue,
although not always to the same degree or in the same way.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>The Pope continues that we should
have confidence that such efforts can be fruitful, because</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n.45.3]: . . .that through
the workings of the Spirit, there already exists in individuals and peoples
an expectation, even if an unconscious one, of knowing the truth about
God, about man, and about how we are to be set free from sin and death.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>The Christian obligation to dialogue
requires the willingness to witness, while forbidding coercive measures.
As the Pope said in 1995 at the United Nations:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n.17]: Faith in Christ
does not impel us to intolerance. On the contrary, it obliges us to engage
others in a respectful dialogue. Love of Christ does not distract us from
interest in others, but rather invites us to responsibility for them, to
the exclusion of no one and indeed, if anything, with a special concern
for the weakest and the suffering. Thus, as we approach the two thousandth
anniversary of the birth of Christ, the Church asks only to be able to
propose respectfully this message of salvation, and to be able to promote,
in charity and service, the solidarity of the entire human family.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>To propose is not to impose. Hence,
the Pope writes in Redemptoris Missio [n. 29.2]: "The Church proposes;
she imposes nothing. She respects individuals and cultures, and she honors
the sanctuary of conscience." After all, it would be immoral, writes the
Pope, ". . . to offend in anyone, beginning with oneself, the personal
dignity common to all."<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup> Let me hasten
to add that this respect for human dignity entails a basic human right
that should always be a civil right, namely, the right and the obligation
to never support or cooperate with the evil acts of another.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If, then, Christians are obligated to promote human dignity and if the
Pope is right that a rebirth of humanity linked to a Christian springtime
is coming, the question is what are we to do? How are we to make straight
the path of the Lord? How shall we counter our culture's growing insensitivity
to others and to the natural moral law? Somehow, we must transform the
growing culture of death that identifies freedom with the ability to guarantee,
through abortion and assisted suicide, that one is not bothered by one's
own relatives.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=+1>Part Three: Recommendations for
promoting natural law</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let us begin by briefly considering the recommendations of various encyclicals
and then conclude with those of <i>Fides et Ratio.</i><sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup>
In <i>Redemptoris Missio</i>, the Pope writes that although individuals
and communities may witness in various ways, the one way in which all are
called to witness is through living a Christian life.<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup>
At this point, I cannot help but recall the wisdom of the Church's newest
doctor and patron saint of the missions, St. Theresa of the Little Flower.
She taught that the key to Christian living was doing little things with
great love. Great love is merciful. And, as the Pope points out in <i>Dives
in Misericordia</i>:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n.7.6]: [Mercy] is as
it were love's second name and, at the same time, the specific manner in
which love is revealed and effected vis-a-vis the reality of the evil that
is in the world, affecting and besieging man, insinuating itself even into
his heart and capable of causing him to "perish in Gehenna (Mt 10:280)."</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Merciful love is thus that which
is best able to counter evil. Merciful love is even more important than
justice--not because it displaces justice but because it ". . .is, so to
speak, the most profound source of justice."<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup>
Christian mercy, explains the Pope [<i>Dives Misericordia],</i></font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n. 14.5]: . . .is, in
a certain sense, the most perfect incarnation of "equality" between people,
and therefore also the most perfect incarnation of justice as well, insofar
as justice aims at the same result in its own sphere. However, the quality
brought by justice is limited to the realm of objective and extrinsic goods,
while love and mercy bring it about that people meet one another in that
value which is man himself, with the dignity that is proper to him.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[14.6] Thus, mercy becomes an
indispensable element for shaping mutual relationships between people,
in a spirit of deepest respect for what is human, and in a spirit of mutual
brotherhood.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>The Pope continues in this encyclical
to explain that merciful love is also sensitive, tender and forgiving without
also indulging evil.<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup> It is thus vital
for Christians to practice forgiveness and justice while living in the
awareness of being trespassers against each other; this awareness ". .
.goes hand in hand with the call to fraternal solidarity, which Saint Paul
[Eph 4:2; cf Gal 6:2] expressed in his concise exhortation to "forbear
one another in love."</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the <i>Gospel of Life</i>, [ev], John Paul II advises us to undertake
certain actions and to teach certain points that celebrate the Gospel of
Life [83.1], and the God of Life [84.1], through songs of thanksgiving
and praise [83.3], daily prayers [84.2], liturgical celebrations [84.3],
by personal witness, volunteer work, social activity and political commitment
[87.1] as well as by adopting a new lifestyle of being rather than having
[98.1]; by teaching responsible procreation [97.2-3]; by promoting a Christian
feminism <sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup>[???]; by forming consciences
[96.1]; by re-linking life and freedom and freedom and truth [96.1-2];
and by fostering "a contemplative outlook" that sees the Creator's image
in creatures and that always seeks to encounter others with dialogue and
solidarity [83.2].</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">In a way, all these recommendations are the Christian
versions of what is required by natural law. In <i>Veritatis Splendor</i>,
John Paul II spells out these requirements of natural law as not only doing
good and avoiding evil but also as being concerned for the transmission
and preservation of life and the development of the material world's riches,
as well as cultivating one's social life, seeking the truth and contemplating
beauty. Of all the actions recommended by these two encyclicals the one
most conducive to happiness--the one that Aquinas identified as happiness--is
the loving contemplation of God.</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">We, very practical Americans, especially need
to cultivate a contemplative spirit content to walk in the presence of
God. A first step in learning the skill of contemplation, according to
Plato, is to begin by appreciating physical beauty, for example, a glorious
sunset; then proceed to the appreciation of just laws and goodness itself.
A similar method, although without metaphysical underpinnings, is given
by Dr. Elaine Scarry, a Harvard professor, in her book <i>On Beauty and
Being Just</i> (1999). She argues that the wonder evoked by beauty decenters
oneself<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup> and thereby leads not only
to the appreciation of justice as beautiful but to the seeking of justice.
This occurs because beauty decenters oneself by making one step outside
of one's own concerns, in a way so pleasurable that, according to Scarry
[1999, 114],</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[it creates] the sense
that it is . . . adjacency that is pleasure-bearing. This seems a gift
in its own right, and a gift as a prelude to or precondition of enjoying
fair relations with others. It is clear that an ethical fairness which
requires "a symmetry of everyone's relation" will be greatly assisted by
an aesthetic fairness that creates in all participants a state of delight
in their own lateralness.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Beauty, in other words, makes us
realize that there is a joy in relationships that is not based upon being
center-stage. For example, visitors to Niagara Falls enjoy sharing their
appreciation for its thundering and surging waters. Likewise, sports fans
love being part of a crowd cheering on their team and doing 'the wave.'
Parents enjoy watching each other watch their first born walk and talk.
In enjoying being adjacent to the main event, beauty-lovers, sports fans
and parents are equal participants; there is symmetry in their relatedness
that involves no subordination, no lost of self, no sacrifice. Experiencing
beauty, thus, teaches that justice---which requires seeing oneself as adjacent
to fairness---need be neither self-threatening nor unpleasurable; it also
teaches that the symmetry of equality in justice is itself beautiful.</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">Beauty also promotes justice because, as Scarry
writes [p.80] , ". . . the fact that something is perceived as beautiful
is bound up with an urge to protect it, or act on its behalf, in a way
that appears to be tied up with the perception of its lifelikeness." Here
Scarry is arguing that our instinct to protect the beautiful is linked
to its life-giving character. Beauty makes us appreciate being alive. "Beauty,"
Scarry [89] writes, "seems to place requirements on us for attending to
the aliveness or (in the case of objects) quasi-aliveness of our world,
and for entering into its protection." Beauty, thus, inspires us to appreciate
life and to seek justice. Scarry's insights here are profound: to so appreciate
the beauty of justice that one enjoys being just does require appreciating
the commonality of adjacency; for, neither oneself nor the other exists
simply to serve another's ends--a fact that is easily lost within cultures
that value efficiency and productivity above all else. Beauty also teaches
us to be truthseekers. Scarry (p.31) explains:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[Beauty] incites in us
the longing for truth because it provides by its compelling "clear discernibility"
an introduction (perhaps even our first introduction) to the state of certainty
. . .and so pleasurable a mental state [is this certainty] that ever afterwards
one is willing to labor, struggle, wrestle with the world to locate enduring
sources of conviction--to locate what is true. . . .beauty is a starting
point for education.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>This explanation correctly points
out that the "clarity" of beautiful truth is a joy; but it overemphasizes
the role this joy plays: do we seek the truth because it is pleasurable
or is it pleasurable because it is true? If pleasure is the reason why
truth is sought, then unpleasurable facts would not be sought. But we do
seek unpleasurable truths: is this lump cancer? Is my child abusing drugs?
Are my students cheating on their exams? Pleasure then does not make truth
valuable; rather it is the ability to understand reality that makes truth
valuable. Truth is pleasurable, and also beautiful, when its provides insight,
when it makes the complex clear, when it shows the unity or symmetry of
many factors.</font></font>
<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Arial Bold">John Paul II takes pains in <i>Fides et Ratio</i>
to emphasize that human beings are naturally truthseekers--even though
truth, and its attainment, is elusive. This is no less the case for believers
in God. Their struggles to understand the truth are no less difficult because
they know that God is truth and that it is possible for their efforts to
be rewarded. The Pope encourages us to undertake this difficult task in
<i>Fides
et Ratio</i> with these words:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n.21]: Yet, for all
the toil involved, believers do not surrender. They can continue on their
way to the truth because they are certain that God has created them "explorers"
(cf. Eccl 1:13), whose mission it is to leave no stone unturned, though
the temptation to doubt is always there. Leaning on God, they continue
to reach out, always and everywhere, for all that is beautiful, good and
true.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>The beautiful, the good and the true
reached their greatest instantiation in the incarnation of Christ. This
means that believers can--and should--always evaluate their pet theories
in the light of Christian revelation. "Of itself," the Pope writes in <i>Fides
et Ratio,</i></font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>[n.23] philosophy is
able to recognize the human being's ceaselessly self-transcendent orientation
towards the truth; and, with the assistance of faith, it is capable of
accepting the "foolishness" of the Cross as the authentic critique of those
who delude themselves that they possess the truth, when in fact they run
it aground on the shoals of a system of their own devising.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Presupposed in this "critique of
the Cross" is the idea that since truth is necessarily universal, so is
the truth of the Cross.<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup> For the human
project is God's project. Therefore, the Pope considers it possible for
philosophy to enable people ". . .to realize that their humanity is all
the more affirmed the more they entrust themselves to the Gospel and open
themselves to Christ."<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup> Bringing this
fact to the attention of the world's philosophers and urging them to reclaim
the wisdom tradition of philosophy was one of the main goal of <i>Fides
et Ratio.</i><sup><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, besides acting as Christians and contemplating truths including Christian
ones, what else can we--as laity, as parents, and as teachers---do to hasten
the rebirth of natural law and humanity? We can seek to eliminate the fears
that have made natural law unpopular and the Good News a threat; we can
especially support the naturally fearless, namely, the young. The natural
fearlessness of the young means that they are not repelled by negatives
as much as they are attracted to positives. The Pope tells us that this
is the case even in their search for love:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>. . .young people are
always searching for beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful.
If they give in to weakness . . .in the depths of their hearts they still
desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls.
Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result,
they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices
this may entail.<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup> They know that their
life has meaning to the extent that it becomes a free gift for others.<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup></font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Difficulties are thus challenges
to be met and not reasons for settling for less. The young respond to knowing
that their destiny is eternal; they are not what they have been told by
pop culture. The Pope writes that the Church needs the young's enthusiasm
and joy of life: "In it is reflected something of the original joy God
had in creating man. The young experience this same joy within themselves.
This joy is the same everywhere, but it is also ever new and original."<sup><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a></sup></font></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Perhaps, another reason why the Pope
calls the young the hope of the Church<sup><a href="#N_33_">(33)</a></sup>
is that their natural fearlessness helps protect them against the siren
song of certain lies that appeal to the fearful. There are six such lies
that either have had, or continue to have, tremendous influence in American
culture.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>The first of these lies is that truth
and goodness diminish freedom. The second lie is that the physical pain
sometimes involved in dying is not controllable by pain management specialists.
The third lie is that the unborn are not really human persons. The second
and third lies have been especially influential in changing the laws forbidding
assisted suicide and abortion; they have identified death as good and have
thereby begun destroying the appreciation of life so basic to natural law.
These two lies are so outrageous that in a few more years--if nothing changes--none
will recall that these were the lies that wedged open our resistance to
killing innocent human beings. The fourth and the fifth lies of our pop
culture are that truth is uncertain and private; wisdom unattainable. The
sixth lie is that love is having another meet one's own expectations.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>As a result of these lies, our pop
culture misrepresents the nature of freedom, the universal certitude of
truth, the possibility of wisdom, and the nature of love and happiness.
As a result, Americans fear truth, morality, and sacrificial love. This
paper has already argued that since freedom is enhanced when channeled
by goodness, freedom is best understood---not as caprice---but as a moral
self-determination based upon the rationally undeniable principles of natural
law. The best argument that I know against reducing truth and wisdom to
being mere expressions of private opinion is that such a reduction cannot
explain the typical experience of knowing that something is true or morally
obligated or wise when one strongly prefers the opposite. The reason why
this experience is evidence against the private view of truth, morality
and wisdom is that if these were indeed merely private opinions relative
to each person, then it would be impossible for anyone to have the experience
of having one's own thoughts oppose one's own preferences. Another argument
was given by Socrates. He argued that falsity becomes impossible when truth
becomes private or relative to each person, because then truth become a
term expressing only that a particular belief is held by oneself and this
is always true as long as one holds the belief--regardless of whether or
not the belief accurately reflects the world. Furthermore, Socrates argues
that when truth is only relative to individuals, then no one can claim
that another's judgement is false. Consequently, one who claims that truth
is relative to each person's perspective must admit that the beliefs of
others are true for them--even when they believe that truth is not relative.
As a result, one claiming that all truth is relative must also claim that
truth is not relative for those denying the relativity of truth. This person
must then claim that all truth is relative and that some truth is not relative.
Such contradictions are self-refuting. Therefore, it cannot be the case
that truth is merely a private matter lacking in universal import.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>A last argument that truth, morality
and wisdom must be universal is based upon the idea that human beings are
the same at all times and all places: they have a nature that cannot be
denied. Hence, for example, it is universally the case that the lack of
food and drink kills, that the lack of friends cause loneliness, and that
to be convinced that life is meaningless causes anxiety and fear.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Consequently, every person, as
<i>Fides
et Ratio</i> [n.27] points out, has a personal philosophy in which they
necessarily seek a comprehensive vision for interpreting life, since the
awareness of one's own mortality necessarily raises the question of whether
there is an after life and what is the meaning of this life? Accordingly,
<i>Fides
et Ratio</i> [n.1] points out that five fundamental questions pervade human
life: "Who am I? Where have I come from and where am I going? Why is there
evil? What is there after this life?" These reveal the need for an answer
that "refers to nothing beyond itself and which puts an end to all questioning."<sup><a href="#N_34_">(34)</a></sup>
<i>Fides et Ratio</i> continues by pointing out that the first answers
to these questions, given by philosophy, identify the Creator [n.19); faith
then allows human beings to know that they exist in relationship to God
and others and that within these relationships lie life's meaning [n.20-21].
These relationships also make it clear that humans are truth-seekers relying
on social bonds involving trust [n.28, 31-4]. And so, all must answer the
question: Whom shall I trust? And why? We should trust only those who have
our best interests at heart and who respect and value our humanity. "In
Jesus Christ," writes the Pope [n.33], ". ..faith recognizes the ultimate
appeal to humanity, an appeal made in order that what we experience as
desire and nostalgia [for God] may come to its fulfillment."<sup><a href="#N_35_">(35)</a></sup>
Christianity is thus worthy of trust because it respects human nature and
unites philosophical and revealed truth. This unity of truth--as personified
in Jesus Christ and expressed by the unification of faith and reason through
the basic obligations to love God and others---enables both reason and
faith to walk, albeit with different strides, upon the path of life and
wisdom.<sup><a href="#N_36_">(36)</a></sup></font></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>This raises our last topic for today:
the nature of human love. American pop culture teaches not what we can
do for love but what love can do for us: it keeps us from being lonely
and bored. Hence, Americans fear Christian love that teaches that we must
die to ourselves<sup><a href="#N_37_">(37)</a></sup> and unite ourselves
to the Cross and love as Christ loved. The price of self-sacrifice seems
way too steep. On the other hand, to love only when it is convenient is
not really to love the other for the other's own sake. And, it is to ignore
what every mother, and every father knows: love not only counts sacrifices
as naught but even counts them as joy: it is a joy to restore one's infant
to a clean diaper; to feed a hungry baby, etc. Parents also know that families
are bonded in such a way that happy children make happy parents and happy
parents make happy children. The communal nature of happiness is true of
all relationships in which love stretches one's self to include another.
In every love, the self is "lost" and ceases to live for itself and by
itself; no self in a loving relationship is autonomous and consumed only
with solitary concerns. In love, one loses the isolated self only to gain
a relational self--- an interdependent self with a greater scope for its
concerns, actions, and joys. All in love rejoice that their solitary worlds
have been lost and replaced by the dynamics of relationship. Thus, to fear
Christianity because of the love it requires is not to understand the nature,
and the joy, of love. Since this is so, the question becomes how can we
show that love need not be feared?</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>The best way is, of course, by example.
Joyfully living in love shows others that which may not seem even imaginable.
The joy, the tenderness and the kindness of love is so good that it is
like a beacon promising that safety and happiness in love is really possible.
To see--to experience--the goodness of love creates more love, as Aquinas
explains (I-II.27.1), love is caused by goodness. The goodness of love
thus inspires us to love properly. "See how they love one another." <sup><a href="#N_38_">(38)</a></sup></font></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>Fear of love is also eliminated when
one finds someone to love. We can assist this process by enabling others
to be seen as like the self: we naturally love ourselves and seek our good;
we also naturally love others and seek their good when they are united
to us through some commonality, for example, the commonality of being human.
The commonality of being human is the basis of the natural law obligation
to love others as oneself and to treat every human being with kindness
and consideration. Since this is so, we can do a great service by simply
pointing out the humanity of those who are different, especially of those
who are poor, sick or in pain. Perhaps, it would be helpful to run a billboard
campaign of faces with the slogan, "I need as much love as you." Or, "I
am as human as you."</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>In any case, given that God is kind
and merciful and given that our Pope is wise, we can be sure that, with
sufficient prayers and sacrifices, there will be both a springtime of Christianity
and a rebirth of humanity that includes its natural law of love. As a result,
we will be able to soar upon the wings of faith and reason.</font></font>

years there has been arguments seeking to disprove the traditional view
that the natural moral law shaped the American conscience and that it did
so as a theistic doctrine. The chief line of attack seems to be that John
Locke's natural law was not that influential and/or that it was not theistic.
See, for example, Hans Aarsleff (1969), Richard Ashcraft (1969), Thomas
Prangle (1990). In defense of the traditional view is Stephen Dworetz (1990)
and the definitive work of Forrest McDonald (1985). Another line of attack
is that the Declaration of Independence is not a foundational document,
since it was surpassed by the Constitution of the United States. But Abraham
Lincoln, in his <i>First Inaugural Address</i>, argued that this was not

freedom originates in the exaltation of freedom so that it is the source
of values and conscience becomes the supreme tribunal of moral judgment.</font></font>

that they need God to cause at least one desire to establish human agency.

[n.10], 'fully reveals man to himself. . . .The man who wishes to understand
himself thoroughly . . .must . . .draw near to Christ. . . .[The]Redemption
that took place through the Cross has definitively restored to man his
dignity and given back meaning to his life in the world."'</font></font>

gods were responsible for much suffering: for example, Greek legends have
it that the gods split human beings into men and women because they were
too happy. The god(s) of the Aztec and Mayan Indians could only be appeased
by human sacrifices. Buddha loves human beings.</font></font>

<p><a NAME="N_21_"></a><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>21. In <i>Fides
et Ratio [n.72]</i>, the Pope identifies three criteria necessary for evangelization:
(1) a recognition that the human spirit, and its basic needs, is the same
in every culture; (2) an appreciation of the Greco-Latin heritage of the
Church which cannot be rejected without denying "the providential plan
of God who guides His Church down the paths of time and history;" and (3)
an avoidance of identifying a legitimate defense of a culture's uniqueness
and original with isolationism and opposition to other traditions. The
gist of <i>Fides et Ratio</i> is primarily concerned with the first criteria
which acknowledges that once human beings are aware of their mortality,
they necessarily wonder whether there is an afterlife and whether there
is any meaning to this life.</font></font>

Missio n.42.1: "The witness of a Chrstian life is the first and irreplaceable
form of mission . . .42.2: "The first form of witness is the very life
of the missionary, of the Christian family, and of the ecclesial community,
which reveal a new way of living. . . .But everyone in the Church, striving
to imitate the Divine Master, can and must bear this kind of witness, in
many cases it is the only possible way of being a missionary."</font></font>

to divorce mercy and justice ". . .fail to see the fundamental link between
mercy and justice spoken of by the whole biblical tradition, and above
all by the messianic mission of Jesus Christ."</font></font>
<p><a NAME="N_24_"></a><font face="Arial Bold"><font size=-1>24. [<i>Dives</i>

or insult."</font></font>

(1999, 112): "It is not that we cease to stand at the center of the world,
for we never stood there. It is that we cease to stand even at the center
of our own world. We willingly cede our ground to the thing that stands
before us."</font></font>

ground for understanding and dialogue with those who do not share our faith.
. . . .the most pressing issues facing humanity--ecology, peace and the
co-existence of different races and cultures, for instance--may possibly
find a solution if there is a clear and honest collaboration between Christians
and the followers of other religions and all those who, while not sharing
a religious belief, have at heart the renewal of humanity. The Second Vatican
Council said as much: 'for our part, the desire for such dialogue, . .
.excludes no one, neither those who cultivate the values of the human spirit
while not yet acknowledging their Source, nor those who are hostile to
the Church . . . .' A philosophy in which there shines even a glimmer of
the truth of Christ, the one definitive answer to humanity's problems,
will provide a potent underpinning for the true and planetary ethics which
the world now needs."</font></font>

themselves to Christ."</font></font>

is not opposed to the truths which philosophy perceives. On the contrary,
the two modes of knowledge lead to truth in all its fullness. This unity
