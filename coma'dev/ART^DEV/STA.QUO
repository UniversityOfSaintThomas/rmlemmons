I, 60, 3 ad 3: ". . .sicut amor est actio manens in agente, itaest motus manens in amante, non autem tendens in aliquid aliud exnecessitate; sed potest reflecti super amantem, ut amet seipsum,sicut et cognitio reflectitur in cognoscentem, ut cognoscatseipsum."





 Indeed the immoral love themselves by seeking satisfaction fortheir passions and for the irrational or sensitive part of thesoul, see ”In IX N.E.• lec. 8, n. 1864.

 I©II, 29, 4c: "Properly speaking it is impossible for a man tohate himself. . . .But accidentally it happens that a man hateshimself: and this in two ways.  First, on the part of the good .. .[willed]. For it happens sometimes that what is desired asgood in some particular respect, is simply evil; and in this way,a man accidentally wills evil to himself; and thus hates himself. Secondly, in regard to himself, to whom he wills good. . . .Andit happens that some men account themselves as being principallythat which they are in their material and sensitive nature. Wherefore they love themselves according to what they takethemelves to be, while they hate that which they really are, bydesiring what is contrary to reason."
