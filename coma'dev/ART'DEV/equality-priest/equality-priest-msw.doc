{\plain \b\fs22 \tab }{\plain \fs22 It is widely argued that neither John Paul II nor the Catholic Church could possibly be 
committed to gender equality, since woman cannot be ordained. This argument presupposes 
that equality precludes gender differentiation. If so, then differentiated gender roles reflect 
inequality. But is this right? Must all forms of equality obliterate all differences? Or, is it possible 
for there to be \'93an equality of difference?\'94\par
}{\plain \fs22 \tab On the one hand, it does not seem possible for the different to be equal, because the 
different\'97as such---lack some commonality whereby they can be compared and known as 
equal, or even as inferior/superior. Accordingly, \'93an equality of difference\'94 would be 
oxymoronic, if it did not presuppose some type of commonality whereby comparisons could be 
made.  So the question becomes whether the commonality that allows comparison must be 
identical; must \'93equality\'94 be a univocal concept? For example, the equality of car drivers is 
univocal, or the same: the role of driving is the same for each, each must obey traffic rules and 
each is penalized in the same way for traffic violations.  Contrast the univocal nature of driving a 
car with the analogical nature of being an artist: not all artists function in the same way, e.g., 
some make music, others make paintings. Yet, for example, Beethoven and Michelangelo are 
equally great artists. In this sense, the equality of Beethoven and Michelangelo, while based 
upon the commonality of excellence, is not based upon the same excellence but upon an 
analogous excellence arising from the relationship of the artist to art: Beethoven is related to 
music }{\plain \i\fs22 as}{\plain \fs22  Michelangelo is related to painting; since those relationships pertain to excellence, 
they are equals; but since their excellences are different, their equality is analogical. Could it 
thus be that such an \'93equality of difference\'94 underlies John Paul II\'92s rejection of ordaining 
women?  If so, then three conditions would have to be met: (1) John Paul II would have to be 
unequivocally supportive of equality between men and women, while (2) upholding gender roles 
that would allow equality to be based upon a commonality that is analogous rather than 
univocal; and, (3) he would also have to hold that ordained priesthood is a gender role. \par
}{\plain \fs22 \tab That John Paul II meets these three conditions can be seen in his Apostolic Letter, }{\plain \i\fs22 On 
the Dignity and Vocation of Women (Mulieris Dignitatem).{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240 
{\plain \super \chftn }{}{\plain }{\plain Boston: Pauline Books and Media.}}}
}{\plain \b\fs22 }{\plain \b\fs22  In this letter, John Paul II expresses 
a commitment to gender equality based upon a sacramental theology wherein nature images 
the divine and wherein the equality of man and woman was definitively established by Genesis 
1:27: \'93God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and 
female He created them.\'94 }{\plain \b\i\fs22 \par

{\plain \b\i\fs22 Mulieris Dignitatem}{\plain \b\fs22  n.6: \'93At this point, however, we can say that the biblical account puts

{\plain \b\fs22 Man and woman equally image God. So, why are these equal images sexually differentiated? 
Could it be that male and female\'97as a pair---also image God? John Paul II thinks so:\par
}\pard \li720 
{\plain \b\fs22 If . . .we wish to draw also from the narrative of the Yahwist text the concept of \'93image of 
God,\'94 we can then deduce that man became the \'93image and likeness\'94 of God not only 
through his own humanity, but also through the communion of persons which man and 
woman form right from the beginning. The function of the image is to reflect the one who 
is the model, to reproduce its own prototype. Man becomes the image of God not so 
much in the moment of solitude as in the moment of communion. He is . . . essentially 
an image of the inscrutable divine communion of Persons.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240

{\plain \b\fs22 Accordingly, heterosexual love and spousal oneness image nothing less than the love and 
oneness of the Trinity, wherein the distinction of persons\'97and roles---preclude neither unity nor 
equality. Since the Trinity constitutes the inner life of God, whatever best images the Trinity 
becomes the definitive and paradigmatic image of God.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240 
{\plain \b\super \chftn }{}{\plain \b }{\plain There are various images of God, e.g. Shepherd, Bridegroom, etcetera. The one that 
images the Trinitarian life of God is most accurate and hence becomes the paradigmatic image 
into which all others must be integrated. }}}
}{\plain \fs22  The spousal unification in love excels 
in imaging the triune God in the following ways: (1) by being a unit constituted by love; (2) by 
being a fecund unit that is not closed in upon itself but is turned outward in the bringing forth of 
new life; (3) by being a unit of }{\plain \i\fs22 distinct }{\plain \fs22  equals.  In this way, the loving heterosexual marriage, as 
the best icon of the Trinity, becomes not only the definitive and paradigmatic image of God but 
also of life and love; we live to love.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240 
{\plain \super \chftn }{}{\plain }{\plain Cf}{\plain \i . Fides et Ratio}{\plain  n. 7: \'93As the source of love, God desires to make himself known; and

differentiated the human race.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240

}{\plain \fs22  Hence, the human mission to love in the image of the Trinity 
bestows upon femininity and masculinity their proper meanings: the meaning of femininity is to 
facilitate woman\'92s ability to enter into relationships of fruitful love and unity between equals; the 
meaning of masculinity is likewise to facilitate man\'92s ability to enter into relationships of fruitful 
love and unity between equals.  Sexuality is for facilitating a Trinitarian-like love.\par
}{\plain \fs22 \tab It has been argued---on the basis of Scripture---that marriage institutionalizes sexual 
inequality. In this regard, two passages are cited most frequently:}{\plain \i\fs22  Genesis}{\plain \fs22  2:18-25 in which 
God declares that Adam will receive a helper fit for him; and }{\plain \i\fs22 Eph.}{\plain \fs22  5:22-23 in which wives are 
told to be submissive to their husbands.  Being a helper and being submissive can be 
understood either as a gender role peculiar to wives or as a spousal role common to both men 
and women. The first interpretation establishes an inequality that contradicts }{\plain \i\fs22 Genesis}{\plain \fs22  1:27 
which, according to }{\plain \i\fs22 Mulieris Dignitatem }{\plain \fs22 n. 6}{\plain \i\fs22 ,}{\plain \fs22  establishes that  \'93 . . . both man and woman are 
human beings to an equal degree, both are created in God\'92s image.\'94   John Paul II also argues 
that the }{\plain \i\fs22 Genesis}{\plain \fs22  text that brings woman forth from Adam\'92s rib confirms her equality.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240

}{\plain \fs22   Taking 
these texts as his guide, John Paul II argues that the Scriptural texts identifying the wife as 
helper and as submissive are identifying spousal roles: man is also the wife\'92s helper{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240

}{\plain \b\fs22  The latter account is particularly explicit: \par

{\plain \b\fs22 The author of the Letter to the Ephesians . . . \'91Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to 
the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife\'92 (5:22-23) . . . knows that this way of 
speaking, so profoundly rooted in the customs and religious tradition of the time, is to be 
understood and carried out in a new way: as a \'93}{\plain \b\i\fs22 mutual subjection out of reverence for 
Christ}{\plain \b\fs22  (cf. Eph. 5:21). . . . in the relationship between husband and wife the \'91subjection\'92

}\pard \sl480 
{\plain \b\fs22 John Paul II\'92s treatment of these Scriptural passages reveals a deep commitment to the 
equality of men and women.\par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab John Paul II\'92s treatment also reveals a sensitivity to the radical nature of the Gospel 
message: Christ sought to restore woman to the equality, respect and dignity }{\plain \b\fs22 that was hers in 
the beginning, that is, before Original Sin.  Original Sin not only ruptured the relationship of 
human beings to God but also the relationship between men and women. }{\plain \b\i\fs22 Genesis}{\plain \b\fs22  3:16 is quite 
explicit that some penalties of Original Sin are gender-specific affecting even the spousal union 
of love:  \'93Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.\'94  In other words, 
}{\plain \b\fs22 Original Sin left woman with the desire to close her love in upon her husband and make him the 
lord, while Original Sin left men with the desire to dominate women. Yielding to either desire is 
the wellspring of all gendered sins\'97even, in today\'92s world.\par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab Neither the gender ramifications of Original Sin nor their gravity have been fully 
recognized. Spouses have suffered much their effects. Moreover, John Paul II teaches, in 
}{\plain \b\i\fs22 Mulieris Dignitatem}{\plain \b\fs22   n. 10, that the }{\plain \b\i\fs22 Genesis}{\plain \b\fs22  punishments \'93refer directly to marriage, but 
indirectly they concern the different spheres of social life: the situations in which the woman 
remains disadvantaged or discriminated against by the fact of being a woman.\'94  Original sin 
thus is responsible for the cultural prevalence of chauvinistic male domination.  Male domination 
has been responsible for much suffering on the part of woman valued as existing only for the 
sake of man\'97and not for her own sake. This is particularly the case since lust gives male 
domination its particular color. A man\'92s lust confirms his dominating tendency and prevents the 
woman from being seen as man\'92s equal; she is, for the man, an object of sexual gratification. 
As a result, lust and its presuppositions of inequality are especially destructive of spousal love 
which requires each spouse to be a gift of love for the other. Lust and inequality block the ability 
of the husband to recognize the wife\'92s acts of love as gifts; rather, such husbands treat any act 
of love as acknowledgment of his superiority. In such relationships, there is nothing the woman 
can do that can be recognized as a spousal love-gift; her initiatives are misunderstood as 
attempts to gain power over the man; they are not perceived as}{\plain \b\i\fs22  inviting}{\plain \b\fs22  }{\plain \b\i\fs22 an equal}{\plain \b\fs22  to a union of 
love. As a writer to Ann Landers complained:{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240

Variety, p. E2. This letter-writer also asserted: \'93Many other cultures openly accept polygamy.  . . 
. And in many countries, adultery is accepted and shrugged off as nothing to get excited about. 
The wife gets the financial support and social position, and the mistress gets the sex. This 
sounds like a fair exchange to me.\'94}{\plain \b  }}}
}{\plain \b\fs22 \par
}\pard \li720 
{\plain \b\fs22 The truth is, there is not a woman on the planet who can fully satisfy the needs of a 
powerful male. When women quit asking men to make them the center of their universe 
and learn to accept a strong man\'92s desire for more than one female companion, families 
will live together longer, more happily and with less rancor.\par

{\plain \b\fs22 \par
}\pard \sl480 
{\plain \b\fs22 Prejudice is blinding. For this reason, male chauvinism is not merely selfishness but a destroyer 
of the possibility of interpersonal love between equals. As the Pope points out: \par
}\pard \li720 
{\plain \b\fs22 . . . \'93domination\'94 indicates the disturbance and loss of the stability of that fundamental 
equality which the man and the woman possess in the \'93unity of the two\'94 and this is 
especially to the disadvantage of the woman, whereas }{\plain \b\i\fs22 only the equality }{\plain \b\fs22 resulting from 
their dignity as persons can give to their mutual relationship the character of an 
}{\plain \b\i\fs22 authentic}{\plain \b\fs22  \'93communio personarum.\'94  }{\plain \b\i\fs22 Mulieris Dignitatem}{\plain \b\fs22   n. 10 (emphasis mine)\par

{\plain \b\fs22 \par
}\pard \sl480 
{\plain \b\fs22 Equality, thus, for John Paul II, is a necessary presupposition to marital love.  Unless a man }{\plain \b\i\fs22 first}{\plain \b\fs22  
affirms that a woman is his equal, her love can neither be recognized as a gift nor reciprocated; 
without reciprocation, an \'93authentic\'94 spousal communion cannot be established. In other words, 
the man\'92s affirmation of a woman\'92s equality necessarily precedes her ability to be a gift of love 
to the man as well as the man\'92s ability to be a gift of love to the woman. Thus, John Paul II\'97in 
order to protect the conditions necessary for spousal love\'97denounces inequality and 
domination----and encourages all to resist the effects of Original Sin.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240

actual existence of such situations and at the same time proclaim the need for conversion, that 
is to say, for purification from evil and liberation from sin: from what offends neighbor, what 
\'93diminishes\'94 man, not only the one who is offended but also the one who causes the offence. 
This is the unchangeable message of the Word revealed by God.\'94}}}
}{\plain \b\fs22   This resistance requires 
recognizing that interpersonal relations belong to the category of love that seeks to serve and 
not to the category of power that seeks to dominate. That this is so was revealed by Christ:  
\'93Christ  . . . fully reveals man to himself and brings to light his most high calling\'94    (}{\plain \b\i\fs22 Gaudium et 
Spes  }{\plain \b\fs22 n. 22).  }{\plain \b\fs22 John Paul II frequently cites this text and acknowledges that it \'93serves as a 
constant reference point\'94 of his teaching.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240

}{\plain \b\fs22  \par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab The gender-specific weaknesses resulting from Original Sin identify not only the 
characteristic ways in which men and women sin against each other but they also the ways in 
which healing must occur. Overcoming the }{\plain \b\i\fs22 Genesis}{\plain \b\fs22  penalties requires healing not only the rift 
between earth and heaven but also the rift between man and woman. Jesus Christ is the healer 
of both rifts.  So the question before us is why is the Divine Healer male? Could \par

human beings and God while also healing the relationship between men and women?\par

}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab A female Christ could not have healed the male heart and given men the realization that 
they ought to be lovers rather than dominators: precisely because the truth about a female 
Christ would have been as obscure to }{\plain \b\i\fs22 fallen}{\plain \b\fs22  men as the truth about women. For Original Sin left 
men blinded by the attractiveness of lust and domination. That this blindness makes it difficult 
to properly appreciate the truth about woman can be seen in the ways in which cultures 
institutionalize male chauvinism and deny woman her natural equality with men. History is filled 
with examples of such deprivations, e.g. polygamy, the exclusively male suffrage, the selling of 
daughters as brides or as prostitutes, traditional Chinese footbinding, wife-burning in pre-colonial India, etcetera.    The absence of such gross forms of injustice within any particular 
culture does not exonerate that culture, since the effects of Original Sin continue as male 
chauvinism. An example of which can be found in universal bestowal of accolades upon men 
who have risked their lives for another especially in making war insofar as women are not 
likewise honored for risking their lives in birthing children. Accordingly, the virtue of courage is 
seen in terms of a man\'92s risk of death primarily in war----rather than in terms of childbearing. 
Yet, death is death and it takes courage to risk dying. Another sign of male chauvinism is how 
men bestow praise upon women who excel; they are said to \'93play like a man,\'94 or, \'93think like a 
man.\'94 Such praise aligns superiority with masculinity rather than with femininity, or even 
humanity.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240

reinforcing the egotistical desire to excel in \'93ruling\'94 over the non-male, especially those 
identified with femininity, i.e. wives and mothers.  Masculinity, hence, becomes identified with 
power over woman. Overcoming this penalty of Original Sin requires Christ to reveal to men, 
and to women, that the mission of masculinity lies, not in egotistical domination, but in the 
continual laying down of one\'92s life for the sake of love.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240

{\plain \b\fs22 Christ\'92s affirmation of the equality and dignity of woman through \'93. . .the Gospel of His words

}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab Perhaps even more radical is the message delivered by His rebuke of Martha in }{\plain \b\i\fs22 Luke}{\plain \b\fs22  
10:38-42: \'93Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things. There is need of 
only one thing.\'94  What was the only thing, that the eminently practical Martha had overlooked? 
The need to do what Mary was doing, namely, sitting \'93at the feet of the Master.\'94{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240 
{\plain \b\super \chftn }{}{\plain \b }{\plain Leora Weitzman made this point in conversation, January 2001. That this is also how

}{\plain \b\fs22  To so sit 
means to be dedicated to learning. This is a radical teaching, a counter-cultural teaching----delivered to a woman, for the sake of all women: women have minds and souls that not only 
must learn the meaning of life, but that also enable them to live the life of learning: (}{\plain \b\i\fs22 Lk}{\plain \b\fs22  10:42), 
\'93Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her.\'94  Christ thereby disagreed 
with Martha\'92s view of womanly duties: femininity calls one to be practical, asserted Martha; 
femininity calls one to learn, responded Christ.  \'93The one thing that is needful\'94 is learning about 
God; it is femininity\'92s higher function. Femininity is not reducible to the realm of 
practicality\'97and husbands. The husband is not the adequate object of all feminine yearning: 
this yearning includes a thirst for God and for learning. Hence the error of male chauvinists and 
of the world\'92s \'93Marthas\'94 who consider the feminine mind as qualified only for practical concerns 
and not for the highest forms of wisdom. This error was thoroughly trounced, according to John 
Paul II,  when Christ discussed the \'93most profound mysteries of God\'94 with the \'93Samaritan 
woman at the well of Sychar.\'94{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240 
{\plain \b\super \chftn }{}{\plain \b }{\plain }{\plain \i Mulieris Dignitatem}{\plain  n.15: }{\plain \'93[Christ] speaks to her of God\'92s infinite gift of love, which is 
like a \'91spring of water welling up to eternal life\'92 (}{\plain \i Jn}{\plain  4:14). He speaks to her [the Samaritan 
woman] about God who is Spirit, and about the true adoration which the Father has a right to 
receive in spirit and truth (cf. Jn 4:24). Finally he reveals to her that he is the Messiah promised 
to Israel (cf. }{\plain \i Jn}{\plain  4:26).  This is an event without precedent: that a }{\plain \i woman}{\plain , . . .become a 
\'93disciple\'94 of Christ. Indeed, once taught, she proclaims Christ to the inhabitants of Samaria, so 
that they too receive him with faith (cf. }{\plain \i Jn }{\plain 4:39-42). This is an unprecedented event, if one 
remembers the usual way women were treated by those who were teachers in Israel; whereas 
in Jesus of Nazareth\'92s way of acting such an event becomes normal.\'94}}}
}{\plain \b\fs22 \par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab The feminine mind, moreover, is not only able to excel in understanding but it can do so 
without sacrificing practicality. Christ, as if to stress this point, asked }{\plain \b\i\fs22 Martha---}{\plain \b\fs22 the woman 
identified with practical concerns and worries---}{\plain \b\fs22 whether she believed the greatest mystery of 
our faith, namely, that Christ is \'93the resurrection and the life.\'94 This question was very abstract 
and hence, many would assume, be not only beyond the cognitive abilities of }{\plain \b\i\fs22 any}{\plain \b\fs22  woman but 
especially beyond those of a }{\plain \b\i\fs22 practical}{\plain \b\fs22  woman. But Martha grasps the question and her 
response is neither a gushy, emotional affirmation nor a deferral to the judgments of men. 
Rather her response shows keen insight into the true identity of Christ: (Jn. 11:27),  \'93I have 
come to believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, The One who is coming into the 
world.\'94  By this response, Martha not only shows that she has acquired that \'93one needful thing,\'94 
but that she has done so with excellence. For she has acquired the deepest understanding of 
the identity of Christ: Christ is THE resurrection and THE life----not because He is merely a 
great prophet with special God-given powers\'97but because He }{\plain \b\i\fs22 is}{\plain \b\fs22  God, THE Messiah. Thus, 
femininity, even in its most practical embodiment, is revealed as being able to intellectually 
excel. Femininity is also revealed in the Gospels\'97according to John Paul II{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240 
{\plain \b\super \chftn }{}{\plain \b }{\plain Cf. }{\plain \i Mulieris Dignitatem}{\plain  n. 16: \'93From the beginning of Christ\'92s mission, women show to

Woman is the equal of man\'97not his tool. Her ability to give love\'97as a woman\'97is for her own 
sake, so that she may discover that femininity is not enslaving but enriching. True love does not 
diminish equality.  }{\plain \b\i\fs22 Gaudium et Spes }{\plain \b\fs22 22 can therefore be read in a way that makes its 
application to woman explicit: Christ fully reveals woman to herself and brings to light her most 
high calling.  This revelation of Christ to woman penetrates her heart and heals the wounding of 
Original Sin that left her \'93desiring/obsessing over her husband/man.\'94 This desire is sinful, as 
sinful as male oppression, because it makes the \'93husband\'94 the }{\plain \b\i\fs22 supreme}{\plain \b\fs22  focal point of woman\'92s 
love. In other words, Original Sin so wounded femininity that woman\'92s love for her man 
becomes paramount\'97so paramount, for example, that no sacrifice is too great. Even maternity, 
for example, is often sacrificed upon the altars of woman\'92s love. \par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab This wounding of femininity by Original Sin can be handled either by refusing to enter 
into marriage or by integrating the love of one\'92s man with the love of God. The first option would 
have been seen as reasonable, if Christ had been incarnated as a woman\'97for three reasons. 
First, a female Christ would have been seen\'97not as rebuking\'97but as confirming the common 
prejudice that woman is to live as the tool of man: a female Christ would have been seen as 
adding the role of liaison with God to the ways in which woman serve man. Secondly, a female 
Christ would not have been able to give masculinity a face responsive to woman\'92s dignity and 
equality. Only a male incarnation of Christ could enable woman to experience that man need 
not be her subjugator. Thirdly, a female Christ would not have been able to heal the ache, left 
by Original Sin, to be fulfilled through love. Jesus Christ, as the perfect embodiment of 
masculinity, enables woman to place her love for }{\plain \b\i\fs22 fallen}{\plain \b\fs22  man into its proper context: there is only 
one truly }{\plain \b\i\fs22 divine}{\plain \b\fs22  man.  God, and not }{\plain \b\i\fs22 fallen}{\plain \b\fs22  man, is to be loved with the entirety of one\'92s mind, 
heart and soul.  Therefore, a female Christ could not have healed woman\'92s heart from the 
wounding of Original Sin; Christ needed to be a man in order to accomplish the divine Gender 
Mission.\par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab A female Christ would thus have convinced neither woman nor man that love is 
liberating and enriching rather than enslaving. For the gendered weaknesses of Original Sin 
disposed the sexes to misconceive gender roles as being constituted by power games or by 
subservience.  It is only Jesus Christ, who is able to heal\'97by His life and by His grace---the rift 
between men and women that obscured the ability of both men and women to see the true 
dignity and equality of each other and, thereby, to enter into paired relationships of love that 
image the Trinity. Love is best between equals, teaches the Trinity. Thus, Jesus Christ\'97by 
restoring the equality of woman with man and by liberating woman from her own enslaving 
desires----enables the sexes to be equal love-gifts for each other.  Jesus Christ thus made it 
possible for men and women to lay down their lives in love---without compromising their 
equality, sexuality, or dignity. As a result, sexual gender roles can now be empowering by 
bringing their participates into the greatest mysteries of joyful love. As John Paul II explains: \par
}\pard \li720 
{\plain \b\fs22 In Christ the mutual opposition between man and woman\'97which is the inheritance of 
original sin\'97is essentially overcome. \'93For you are all one in Jesus Christ,\'94 St. Paul will 
write }{\plain \b\i\fs22 (ibid.).  }{\plain \b\fs22 These words concern that original \'93unity of the two\'94 which is linked with the 
creation of the human being as male and female, made in the image and likeness of 
God, and based on the model of that most perfect communion of Persons which is God 
himself.\'94 }{\plain \b\i\fs22  Mulieris Dignitatem}{\plain \b\fs22   n. 11.}{\plain \b\i\fs22 \par
}\pard 
{\plain \b\i\fs22 \par
}\pard \sl480 
{\plain \b\fs22 In other words, Jesus Christ reconciles man to woman and woman to man, thereby enabling 
their reciprocated love-gifts to joyfully image nothing less than the Trinity. \par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab Since, as we have seen, this reconciliation relies upon the }{\plain \b\fs22 masculinity of Christ, 
masculinity }{\plain \b\i\fs22 seems}{\plain \b\fs22  to be privileged over femininity in salvation history. This element of inequality 
}{\plain \b\i\fs22 seems}{\plain \b\fs22  to be confirmed by John Paul II\'92s insistence upon reserving the ordained priesthood to 
men: after all, if the masculinity of Christ is essential to His mission of healing the rift between  
men and women, then those who image Him in His }{\plain \b\i\fs22 Gender Mission }{\plain \b\fs22 must be men. And, their 
masculinity must be identified with }{\plain \b\i\fs22 that}{\plain \b\fs22  mission, i.e., with the laying down of one\'92s life both in 
the loving service to others and in }{\plain \b\fs22 the affirmation of woman\'92s equality and dignity. This means 
that the masculinity of ordained priests becomes iconic: it historically links the current age to 
The Fall and to God\'92s Gender Mission, thereby teaching that none of us escapes the 
weaknesses of the Fall, nor the need of divine mercy; it draws attention to the gender-specific 
weaknesses of Original Sin, thereby identifying the mission of masculinity with loving service 
and with restoring, and preserving, the dignity and equality of women; it images male-atonement for sins against women, thereby reminding all that ordained priests function as the 
image of The One, who as the sacrificial lamb atoned for all sins, at all times and at all places. 
Ordained priests are thus double icons of sacrificial atonement: their masculinity reflects the 
Gender Mission of God; their humanity, His Humanitarian Mission .\par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab The iconic status of ordained priests }{\plain \b\i\fs22 also seems}{\plain \b\fs22  to promote sexual inequality in so far 
as ordaining only men }{\plain \b\i\fs22 seems}{\plain \b\fs22  to entail (a) a power differential between men and women; (b) a 
restriction of Church authority to men; and (c) an identification of masculinity as being more 
important for salvation than femininity. In regard to the first point, I do not deny that ordaining 
only men creates a power differential between men and women. However,  if masculinity is 
requisite for ordained priests in so far as they image God\'92s Gender Mission, then the resulting 
power differential favors women. For, then, not only must priests model that the mission of 
masculinity lies in loving service that includes affirming the dignity and equality of every woman, 
but priests must oppose the mistreatment of woman\'97as did Christ. If priests thereby image the 
mission of Christian masculinity, then each man must do likewise. Men, and especially priests, 
are thus placed in the service of woman in three ways: (1) by obligating men to honor\'97and to 
promote---the truths of woman\'92s dignity and equality; (2) by requiring men to subordinate---to 
these truths---their inclinations, arising from Original Sin, to dominate women; and, (3) by giving 
every woman the power\'97and the right---of appealing to the consciences of men. This pro-woman power shift does not create a new form of sexual inequality, but only begins to restore 
the sexual equality once lost----and continually being lost\'97by the wounding of Original Sin.\par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab The second point that ordaining only men }{\plain \b\fs22 restricts Church authority to men mistakenly 
assumes that Church authority stems from the sex, or the gender, of the Church legislator 
rather than from the Cross. The authority of the Cross legislates obligations for all who would 
be saved by the Cross. Hence, for example, child abuse, incest, etcetera, are wrong, not 
because they have been proscribed by men, but because they violate the maxims of human 
love and despise the love of the Creator-Redeemer. Furthermore, if Church authority could 
reside only in men, then the Church could not have recognized women{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240 
{\plain \b\super \chftn }{}{\plain \b }{\plain This point made by Siobhan Marshall }{\plain in a conversation on January 2001.}}}
}{\plain \b\fs22 \'97especially, those with 
a typically feminine theology, such as Therese Lisieux---as Doctors of the Faith.\par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab The last point that ordaining only men entails privileging masculinity over femininity is 
the strongest basis for arguing that Catholicism entails gender inequality. However, gender 
inequality cannot result from privileging masculinity, if femininity were likewise privileged. In 
brief: either femininity is as indispensable as masculinity to salvation or gender inequality 
necessarily results from the exclusively male priesthood. The Church cannot countenance any 
version of gender inequality for two reasons. First of all, }{\plain \b\i\fs22 Genesis}{\plain \b\fs22  1:27 directly reveals that each 
sex equally images God. Secondly, gender inequality would compromise the ability of a loving 
marriage to image the Trinity (wherein distinction is not inequality).  On the other hand, the 
Church cannot preclude gender inequality by ordaining women, because, then, the priest would 
no longer be able to image Christ in His Gender Mission. Accordingly, the only viable option for 
the Church is to recognize that femininity is as necessary for salvation as masculinity\'97even 
though its gender role is not the same as the gender role of masculinity.\par
}{\plain \b\fs22 \tab John Paul II argues that femininity is as instrumental to salvation as masculinity, since 
none can be saved without reciprocating the love of Christ\'96-as a bride accepts and responds to 
her groom and since Scripture identifies the Church as the Bride of Christ.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \b\super \chftn }{}{\plain \b }{\plain }{\plain \i Mulieris Dignitatem }{\plain n. 25:  \'93. . . all human beings\'97both women and men\'97are called 
through the Church, to be the \'91Bride\'92 of Christ, the Redeemer of the world. In this way, \'91being 
the bride,\'92 and thus the \'91feminine\'92 element, becomes a symbol of all that is \'91human,\'92 according 
to the words of Paul: \'91There is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus\'92 (}{\plain \i Gal}{\plain  
3: 28). . . . .as members of the Church, men too are included in the concept of \'91Bride.\'92 . . . In the 
Church every human being\'97male and female\'97is the \'91Bride,\'92 in that he or she accepts the gift 
of the love of Christ the Redeemer, and seeks to respond to it with the gift of his or her own 
person.\'94 [sic\}.  \par
}}\pard \sa240 
{{\plain \tab Three comments. First, it should be noted that this document\'92s identification of 
femininity with responsiveness is }{\plain \i neither }{\plain an identification of femininity with passivity nor with 
subservience; both of these are ruled out by Scripture\'92s identification of the feminine/masculine 
spousal union as the image of the Trinity as well as by the friendship offered to women by 
Christ: passivity and subservience properly characterize neither spousal love nor friendship. 
Secondly, it should be noted that John Paul II\'92s argument that femininity marks the response of 
every human being to God need not be taken for anything other than the recognition that just as 
Original Sin precludes the ability for women to acquire equality independently of male 
affirmation, it also precludes the ability of any human to acquire salvation independently of 
Christ. This means that feminine responsiveness to God\'92s grace does not determine how that 
responsiveness is expressed. As a result, the Church can respond with masculine as well as 
feminine forms of piety.  In brief: femininity\'92s bridal imagery does not necessitate that all adopt, 
for example, the bridal mysticism of St. Bernard of Clairvoux. Indeed, the Gender Mission of 
Christ and its entailment of ordaining only men precludes the assumption that there is no 
masculine way to respond to God\'92s love.  Third, John Paul II\'92s most recent treatment of this 
issue in his }{\plain \i General Audience of Feb. 7}{\plain \i\super th}{\plain \i , 2001}{\plain  characterizes the Church\'92s femininity in terms of 
love and fruitfulness (n. 1): \'93The feminine symbol represents the face of the Church in her 
various aspects as betrothed, bride and mother, thus stressing a dimension of love and 
fruitfulness.\'94}}}
}{\plain \fs22   This identification 
of the Church\'92s femininity with responsiveness links the Church to the post-Fall status of 
women and men; for just as Original Sin makes the man\'92s affirmation of woman\'92s dignity and 
equality a pre-requisite for receiving her love, salvation requires that the Church receives from 
the Lord, the love which she reciprocates to Him.  To reciprocate the love of Christ is to be His 
friend and to seek what He loves.  At this point, the difference between Groom/Bride, 
masculinity/femininity and man/woman melts into unanimity as each seeks that which Christ 
loves. Or, as St. Paul said (}{\plain \i\fs22 Gal.}{\plain \fs22  3:28): \'93There is neither male nor female; for you are all }{\plain \i\fs22 one}{\plain \fs22  in 
Christ Jesus.\'94 \par
}{\plain \fs22 \tab Although gender and its roles are transcended within the realm of graced love, the ever-present gender specific weaknesses of Original Sin both within ourselves and within our gender 
culture insures that every fallen man and woman must continually seek to overcome these 
weaknesses. In any case, salvation cannot occur without both the Bridegroom and the Bride;  
none can be saved apart from Christ and His Church. Together, through the unity of their love, 
they birth\'97and rear---the children of God. And, image the Trinity---wherein persons, unified in 
self-giving love, are distinct yet equal.  As a result, }{\plain \fs22 the gender roles of masculinity and 
femininity are equally indispensable for salvation\'97even though they are distinct and even 
though being Christ and being an ordained priest are identified as male gender roles.  Gender 
equality is thus, within John Paul II\'92s theology, an analogous concept: masculinity and femininity 
share the commonality of being essential for salvation, while retaining distinct salvific roles. 
Hence, their equality is one of difference, that is to say, it is analogous. Consequently, neither 
gender nor sexual inequality results from reserving priestly ordination solely to men.\par

{\plain \fs22 \tab }{\plain \b\fs22 Argument summary:}{\plain \fs22  (1) Original Sin affected the relationship between human beings 
and God as well as the relationship between men and women. (2) Restoring the relationship 
between human beings and God (God\'92s Humanitarian Mission ) did not require essential gender 
differentiation: Christ could have been incarnated as a woman because restoring the human 
relationship to God required only that the divine incarnation be truly human }{\plain \i\fs22 and}{\plain \fs22  the sexes are 
equally human. (3) Restoring the second relationship (God\'92s Gender Mission) required a male 
incarnation because Original Sin affected the sexes so differently that their relationship could 
only be restored by a divine }{\plain \i\fs22 man}{\plain \fs22 . (4) As a result, the Gender Mission of Christ requires that 
those who are His ordained images be male. (5) Thus, the Gender Mission of Christ bestows 
upon masculinity a unique salvific role that would have impaired both gender equality and the 
human ability to image the Trinity, if femininity had not also received a unique salvific role as 
necessary as the role of masculinity. (6) The identification of Christ as the bridegroom and the 
Church as the bride establishes that the gender roles played by masculinity and femininity are 
equally necessary for salvation, although they are differentiated.  (7) This means that gender 
equality is not univocal but analogous, since masculinity and femininity share the commonality of 
being essential to salvation and since their essential roles differ.{\super \chftn {\footnote \pard \sa240
