<p><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><b>INTRODUCTION:</b>&nbsp; <b>The loves
of a people define its culture and when that culture includes rule by law,
an abhorrence of cruelty, and respect for individual freedoms that culture
is civilized. Civilization is thus a cultural expression of love for law,
civility and freedom. To define culture and civilization in terms of a
people's loves gives the political philosopher a powerful analytical tool:
love explains not only the inspiration that energizes a people but also
explains the rise and fall of governments. For example, European communism
and Philippine totalitarianism ended not through the violent overthrow
of oppressive governments but by the peaceful resistance of peoples who
loved freedom more than security/safety.<sup><a HREF="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>
Likewise, the loves of the American people---and, especially, their love
of God<sup><a HREF="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>---confined their revolutionary
fires and enables the colonies to avoid, for the most part, the terrors
of the French revolution which were fed by hatred of the monarchy and of
the Church. Marx was wrong: class hatred does not advance civilization.
Love does. Another example illustrating this point is the American Civil
Rights Campaign of the 1960's. Martin Luther King inspired by Mohandas
Gandhi used the American love of God<sup><a HREF="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>
and their inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
to argue that there were laws denying these rights to African Americans.
These examples when coupled with my research into moral foundationalism
convince me <i>not only </i>that a people is best understood according
to their loves <i>but also</i> that civilizations are advanced and preserved
when they are expressions of cultural loves for the rule of law, individual
freedom, civility and God. Thus, if love is a powerful analytical tool
for political philosophers and if civilizations of love embody the hope
of human beings, then John Paul II has been acting as a most excellent
political philosopher by using love to analyze recent and on-going historical
changes in Europe and in the world. Indeed, as far as I know, he coined
the phrase &quot;civilization of love.&quot; He has also played a critical role in
the collapse of European communism as George Weigel argues in <i>The Final
Revolution</i>. The Pope's political philosophy thus receives special attention
in this course</b>.</font>
<br><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Political philosophy needs a new tool of analysis especially within the
United States; because, contemporary political philosophers have become
concerned that public discourse defined in terms of America's dominant
political philosophy, liberalism, has increasingly treated the American
political system as reducible to the &quot;procedural republic.&quot; Love of process
is to replace love of the traditional common goods of law, civility and
freedom. The main impetus for this transformation is due to the cultural
popularity of relativism and its argument that truth promotes intolerance.
Relativism, however, is unable to sustain the natural law context given
to inalienable rights by our Founding Fathers. This is because inalienable
rights are inalienable only if they are absolutes and relativism denies
all absolutes. As we shall see, perceptive liberals recognize the self-refuting
nature of relativism and seek to avoid it. But the cultural popularity
of relativism makes redefining liberalism difficult. Yet unless this redefinition
is successful, then the cultural embeddedness of inalienable rights shall
diminish and the American civilization's emphasis upon the inalienable
rightness of life shall end. Once it does those seeking to kill the infirm
will be successful in legalizing euthanasia and establishing a cultural
component intolerant towards those who arouse pity. The resulting culture
of death opposes civilizations of love that seek to care for their infirm---not
to kill them.</b></font>
<br><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two fundamental questions thus focus this course: (1) what must a people
and its government do to protect and develop the civilization of love;
(2) granted that the loudest voice in favor of the civilization of love
now belongs to Christianity what is the proper role---if any---for that
voice within American pluralism?</font></b>
<ul>
<ul><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><font SIZE="-1">1. In this regard the
immortal words of Patrick Henry sounds in our ear: &quot;Is life so dear, or
peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?
Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as
for me, give me liberty, or give me death.&quot;&nbsp; 2. &quot;Besides, sir, we
shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over
the destinies of nations . . .&quot; Patrick Henry; same famous speech as above.&nbsp;
3. &quot;Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children.&quot;

<h2>
<b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica">COURSE OBJECTIVES</font></b></h2>
<b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica">1. To develop the skills of logical analysis
and philosophical arguments within the context of political philosophy.</font></b><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

<p><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica">2. To determine the structures and institutions
necessary to develop and to protect the civilizations of love. This objective
will be met by undertaking a philosophical analysis of certain key encyclicals
and key speeches of Pope John Paul II.</font></b><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

<p><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica">3. To identify the fears that have historically
silenced, and continue to silence, the religious voice. This objective
will be primarily met by evaluating the historical components of various
course readings.</font></b><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

<p><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica">4. To identify how religious believers
may properly promote within a pluralistic America a particular view about
shaping a people's culture and civilization. This objective will be met
by evaluating the philosophical arguments in <i>Catholicism and Liberalism</i>
and by examining whether John Paul II successfully models a way for pluralism
to hear the religious voice in his speeches found in <i>The Pope In America.</i></font></b><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

<p><b><font FACE="Arial,Helvetica">5. To develop sensitivity to the American
cultural perspective on various course topics, e.g. the proper role for
the religious voice, the culture of death, the forms of human happiness
etc.</font></b>
