harmony between heaven and earth. True feminism is the peaceful activism to promote
sexual equality in the belief that men and women really are equal to each other. In this
short paper, I argue that feminism is a part of everyone&#8217;s vocation&#8211;including the man&#8217;s.
For since the human vocation requires all to use whatever opportunities they can to fight
injustice through a love understood as a providential and collaborative care, all are
obligated to fight the oppression of women, since Original Sin makes the oppression of
women is omnipresent.</span></p>

God not only through his own humanity, but also through the communion of
persons which man and woman form right from the beginning. The function of the
image is to reflect the one who is the model, to reproduce its own prototype. Man
becomes the image of God not so much in the moment of solitude as in the
moment of communion. He is . . . essentially an image of the inscrutable divine
communion of Persons.</span>

unity nor equality. The spousal unification in love excels in imaging the triune God in the

femininity and masculinity their proper meanings: self-transcendence through a fruitful
love between distinct equals. Sexuality is for facilitating a fruitful Trinitarian-like love.

institutionalizes sexual inequality. In this regard, two passages are cited most frequently:<i>
Genesis</i> 2:18-25 in which God declares that Adam will receive a helper fit for him; and
<i>Eph.</i> 5:22-23 in which wives are told to be submissive to their husbands.  Being a helper
and being submissive can be understood either as a gender role peculiar to wives or as a
spousal role common to both men and women. The first interpretation establishes an
inequality that contradicts the equality required by <i>Genesis</i> 1:27. It also misunderstands
the story of Adam and Eve. According to John Paul II, the <i>Genesis</i> text that brings
woman forth from Adam&#8217;s rib confirms her equality.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt">  Original Sin not only ruptured the
relationship of human beings to God but also the relationship between men and women.
<i>Genesis</i> 3:16 is quite explicit that some penalties of Original Sin are gender-specific,
affecting even the spousal union of love:  &#8220;Your desire shall be for your husband, and he
shall rule over you.&#8221;  In other words, Original Sin left woman with the desire to close her
love in upon her husband and make him the lord, while Original Sin left men with the
desire to dominate women. Yielding to either desire is the wellspring of sexual inequality
and oppression. </span></p>

<i>Genesis</i> punishments, writes John Paul II,  &#8220;refer directly to marriage, but indirectly they
concern the different spheres of social life: the situations in which the woman remains
disadvantaged or discriminated against by the fact of being a woman.&#8221;</span>

valued as existing only for the sake of man&#8212;and not for her own sake. This is
particularly the case since lust gives male domination its particular color. A man&#8217;s lust
confirms his dominating tendency and prevents the woman from being seen as man&#8217;s
equal; she is, for the man, an object of sexual gratification. As a result, lust and its
presuppositions of inequality are especially destructive of spousal love which requires
each spouse to be a gift of love for the other. Lust and inequality block the ability of the
husband to recognize the wife&#8217;s acts of love as gifts; rather, such husbands treat any act of
love as acknowledgment of his superiority. In such relationships, there is nothing the
woman can do that can be recognized as a spousal love-gift; her initiatives are
misunderstood as attempts to gain power over the man; they are not perceived as<i> inviting</i>
<i>an equal</i> to a union of love. As a writer to Ann Landers complained:</span>

a powerful male. When women quit asking men to make them the center of their

<br>
<p style="line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-size: 12pt">The prejudice, shown in this letter, shows how blinding male chauvinism can be. For this

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt">. . . &#8220;domination&#8221; indicates the disturbance and loss of the stability of that
fundamental equality which the man and the woman possess in the &#8220;unity of the
two&#8221; and this is especially to the disadvantage of the woman, whereas <i>only the
equality </i>resulting from their dignity as persons can give to their mutual
relationship the character of an <i>authentic</i> &#8220;communio personarum.&#8221;  <i>Mulieris

<br>
<p style="line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Equality, thus, for John Paul II, is a necessary presupposition to marital love.  Unless a
man <i>first</i> affirms that a woman is his equal, her love can neither be recognized as a gift
nor reciprocated; without reciprocation, an &#8220;authentic&#8221; spousal communion cannot be
established. In other words, the man&#8217;s affirmation of a woman&#8217;s equality necessarily
precedes her ability to be a gift of love to the man as well as the man&#8217;s ability to be a gift
of love to the woman. </span></p>

love&#8212;denounces sexual inequality----and encourages all to resist the on-going and
persistent effects of Original Sin.  This resistance requires recognizing that interpersonal
relations are not folder for egotistical power games but for altruistic love. Altruistic love
transcends the self; it, thereby, frees the self.</span>

the obligation to counter the effects of Original Sin makes collaboration a universal duty.
As John Paul II points out:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Collaboration in the development of the whole person and of every human being
is in fact <span style="font-weight: bold">a duty of all toward all</span> . . .  If, on the contrary, people try to achieve it
in only one part, or in only one world, they do so at the expense of the others; and
, precisely because the others are ignored, their own development becomes
exaggerated and misdirected. <i>Sollicitudo Rei Socialis</i> n. 32.2.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-size: 12pt">We are an interdependent race: the confined heart is deformed and enslaved by selfish
desires. Self-development and flourishing requires being other-centered. Other-centeredness caring about the other&#8217;s perspective and needs; it requires listening to the
other; it thus requires collaboration. Collaboration expresses a caring, providential love.
Collaborative and providential love is the means for achieving the common good.  Such
love humanizes the world.</span>

oppression of all, but also the obligation to end the oppression of women. As such, it is
the obligation to be a feminist. The obligation to end the oppression of women---through
merciful love and collaboration&#8212;honors maternal relationships. It finds the killing of her
offspring, whether born or unborn, morally reprehensible and demeaning. Feminism must
be pro-life in order to be truly supportive of women&#8217;s reality and her vocation to self-transcendent love. Pro-life feminism, moreover, requires human reproduction to occur
through heterosexual love unions, since cloning or asexual reproduction is inseparable
from the destruction of embryonic human life.  Pro-life feminism thus requires all to be a
complementarian or personalist feminist. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In other words, personalist feminism argues that heterosexual reproduction of the
human race, not only identifies complementarity as essential to sexuality, but also
identifies the continuation of the race with self-transcendence through union with others.
But since there is no self-transcendence without love, personalist feminism argues that
the human destiny is achieved through love. Thus, personalist feminism holds that self-transcendence through love should characterize all human interactions&#8211;even those at
work.  Self-transcendence at work is achieved when providential and collaborative work
aims at advancing the common good. Thus, heterosexual complementarity marks each of
us as designed by the Creator for love at all times and places.</span>

identity, then there is no sure principle for guaranteeing just relations between
people. Their self-interest as a class, group or nation would inevitably set them in
opposition to one another. If one does not acknowledge transcendent truth, then
the force of power takes over, and each person tends to make full use of the means
at his disposal in order to impose his own interests or his own opinion, with no
regard for the rights of others. People are then respected only to the extent that
they can be exploited for selfish ends. <i>Centesimus Annus</i> n. 44.</span></p>
