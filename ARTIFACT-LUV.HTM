<p><strong>The goals of this course include advancing one's logical skills and one's
understanding of American culture on the nature of love, sex and friendship. For your
cultural artifact present to the class: (1) some manmade object that represents either a
dominant or a minority aspect of how American culture views love, sex or friendship; and
(2) a handout containing two arguments: (1) an argument that your artifact reflects a
cultural perspective on the nature of love, sex or friendship; and (2) an argument that
that your cultural artifact either promotes or hinders the truth about human
relationships. Presentations should be insightful, reflective and well-argued.</strong></p>
