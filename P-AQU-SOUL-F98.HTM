TO HYLOMORPHISM</b></font></big></big><b><br>
</b></big><br>
<b>Aquinas's doctrine on the soul is both like and unlike Plato's view. Like
Plato, Aquinas held that every soul is the life-force of&nbsp; all living
bodies. Unlike Plato, Aquinas held that the body results from the soul's
ability to actualize and unify matter into a living body. This actualizing
and unifying ability of the soul makes it the body's form (substantial form).
There are three different kinds of bodies, because there are three different
kinds of souls: vegetative, sentient, and rational. Although there are only
three species of souls (vegetative, sentient, and rational), there are many
individuals within each species. This is possible because the matter which
the soul actualizes is individualized: matter is the principle of individuation.
Souls are ranked according to their highest act, since being is revealed
by activity. The differences between vegetative, sentient, and rational activities
reveal that these souls differ according to their degree of actuality, immateriality
and perfection. The rational soul has the greatest degree of actuality, immateriality
and perfection. Each higher soul can do what the lower soul can do. The sentient
soul can perform vegetative activities; the rational soul can perform sentient
activities. Only the rational soul has a degree of immateriality that suffices
for subsistence, immortality and imperishability. </b><br>

<b><font face="Arial Black"><font size="+2">ON THE SOUL'S IMMATERIALITY AND
EXISTENCE</font></font></b>  
<p><br>
<b>I.75.1: WHETHER EVERY SOUL IS IMMATERIAL?</b> </p>
<p><b><i>N.B. The way in which Aquinas argues for the soul's immateriality 
identifies his philosophy as hylomorphic. Hylomorphism teaches that the soul
activates unifies individuating matter into a living body. &nbsp;Evidence
that the body's unity arises from the soul can be found in the fact that
the body disintegrates upon death, which defines the end of the soul's activation
of matter. Life is thus a unifying activity that cannot be caused by matter.
If so, then every living body is constituted by the soul's union with individuating
matter. There are different types of bodies: bodies that survive through
nutritive acts (plants), bodies that survive through sensation and perception
(animals), and bodies that survive through reasoning (human). Thus, there
are three different types of souls: vegetative, sentient and rational.&nbsp;</i></b> 
</p>
<p><b><big>I answer that,</big> To seek the nature of the soul, we must premise
that the soul is defined as the first principle of life of those things which 
live: for we call living things "animate," [*i.e. having a soul], and those 
things which have no life, "inanimate." Now life is shown principally by two
actions, knowledge and movement.</b> </p>
<p><b>[The opinion that the soul is corporeal (physical) . . .can be proved 
to be false in many ways; but we shall make use of only one proof, based on
universal and certain principles, which shows clearly that the soul is not
a body. Now, though matter may be a principle of life as the heart is a principle
of life in an animal, nothing material can be the first principle of life.
For it is clear that to be a principle of life, or to be alive, does not
belong to matter as such; since, if that were the case, all material things
would be alive. <br>
</b></p>
<p><b>Therefore matter---which is able to be a living thing or even a principle
of life---is as such only <i>potentially</i> a living body. When it is <i>actually</i>
a body, some principle must be activating its potency for being a living
body. [That principle of activation is the soul.] Accordingly, the soul as
the first principle of life [does not consists of matter; it is rather immaterial
so that it can animate matter into a living body.]</b> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.75.5: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM?</b> </p>
<p><b><i>N.B. Within this article are two arguments; your selection concerns 
the second argument, which relies upon the individuating character of matter 
to prove that the human soul must be totally immaterial..</i></b> </p>
<p><b><big>I answer that,</big> The soul has no matter [because] . . . it
is clear that whatever is received into something is received according to
the condition of the recipient. Now a thing is known in as far as its form
is in the knower. But the intellectual soul [understands the universal natures
of things]: for instance, it knows a stone according to its nature as a stone 
[[as it knows wax according to its nature as wax]]; and therefore the form 
of a stone universally considered is in the intellectual soul. ...<i>But if
the intellectual soul were composed of matter and form, the forms of things
would be received into it as individuals, and so it would only know the individual</i>:
just as it happens with the sensitive powers which receive forms in a corporeal
organ; since matter is the principle by which forms are individualized. It
follows, therefore, that the intellectual soul, and every intellectual substance
which has knowledge of [universals] is exempt from composition of matter
and form.</b> <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p><b>I.75.2: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS SOMETHING SUBSISTENT?</b> </p>
<p><b><i>N.B. Since subsistence means to exist on one's own, this article 
is asking whether the human soul has the type of existence that enables it
to exist on its own, i.e. independently of matter. If the human soul does
not subsist, then its existence relies upon matter and ceases when the body
is unable to sustain life.</i></b> </p>
<p><b><i>ARTICLE COMMENTARY: In this article Aquinas relies upon the principle 
that ACTION FOLLOWS EXISTENCE, i.e. a thing acts according to its mode of
existence. Thus, if the intellect has an act that is independent of matter,
then it must exist independently of matter (it must be its own subsistence).
The intellect has such an act because its ability to know all material things
presupposes that it does not consists of matter; the intellect is not the
brain. This article thus presents a key argument against materialism.</i></b> 
</p>
<p><b><i>Another argument based upon Thomistic principles is that since matter
is the principle of individuation, universals can neither exist in matter
nor be known by a material entity. Therefore, the intellectual soul which
knows universals cannot be material. See I.75.5 for Aquinas' more detailed
argument.</i></b> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>OBJ 3: Further, if the soul were subsistent, it would have some operation 
apart from the body. But it has no operation apart from the body, not even 
that of understanding: for the act of understanding does not take place without
a <i>sense image</i>, which cannot exist apart from the body. Therefore the
human soul is not something subsistent.</b> </p>
<p><b><big>I answer that,</big> It must necessarily be allowed that the principle 
of intellectual operation which we call the soul, is a principle both incorporeal 
and subsistent. For it is clear that by means of the intellect man can have
knowledge of all corporeal things. Now whatever knows certain things cannot
have any of them in its own nature; because that which is in it naturally
would impede the knowledge of anything else. Thus we observe that . . . [none
can sense the temperature of water when the hand is as warm as the water].
Hence, if the intellectual principle contained the nature of a body it would
be unable to know all bodies. Therefore, since every body has its own determinate
nature, it is impossible for the intellectual principle to be a body. It
is likewise impossible for it to understand by means of a bodily organ; since
the determinate nature of that organ would impede knowledge of all bodies;
as when a certain determinate color is not only in the pupil of the eye,
but also in a glass vase, the liquid in the vase seems to be of that same
color.</b> </p>
<p><b>Therefore the intellectual principle which we call the mind or the intellect
has an operation in and through itself apart from the body. Now only that
which subsists can have an operation in and through itself. For nothing can
operate but what is actual: for which reason we do not say that heat imparts
heat, but that what is hot gives heat. We must conclude, therefore, that
the human soul, which is called the intellect or the mind, is something incorporeal
and subsistent.</b> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Reply OBJ 3: The body is necessary for the action of the intellect, 
not as its origin of action, but on the part of the object; for the sense 
image is to the intellect what color is to the sight. Neither does such a
dependence on the body prove the intellect to be non-subsistent; otherwise 
it would follow that an animal is non-subsistent, since it requires external 
objects of the senses in order to perform its act of perception.</b> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.75.3: WHETHER THE SOULS OF BRUTE ANIMALS ARE SUBSISTENT?</b> </p>
<p><b><i>N.B. Brute animals are those with all of the external and internal
senses, e.g., apes, ducks, cats.&nbsp; If animal souls were subsistent, then
it would be possible for animals to be immortal.</i></b> </p>
<p><b><big>I answer that, </big><i>The ancient philosophers</i> made no distinction 
between sense and intellect, and referred both to a corporeal principle, as
has been said (A1). <i>Plato</i>, however, drew a distinction between intellect
and sense; yet he referred both to an incorporeal principle, maintaining
that sensing, just as understanding, belongs to the soul as such. From this
it follows that even the souls of brute animals are subsistent. <br>
</b></p>
<p><b>But <i>Aristotle</i> held that of the operations of the soul, understanding 
alone is performed without a corporeal organ. [Thus, we can determine whether 
animals have subsistent souls by whether sensation and perception are bodily 
activities.&nbsp; If they are bodily activities, then the souls of animals 
are not subsistent. But,] . . . sensation and the consequent operations of
the sensitive soul are evidently accompanied with change in the body; thus
in the act of vision, the pupil of the eye is affected by a reflection of
color: and so with the other senses. Hence [since sensation and perception 
are bodily activities] it is clear that the sensitive soul has no act in and
through itself, and that every operation of the sensitive soul belongs to
the composite. <br>
</b></p>
<p><b>Therefore we conclude that since the souls of brute animals have no
acts in and through themselves, they are not subsistent. For the operation
of anything follows the mode of its being.</b> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.75.4: WHETHER THE SOUL IS THE PERSON OR WHETHER THE PERSON IS A UNION
OF SOUL AND MATTER?</b> </p>
<p><b><i>N.B. If Aquinas would argue that the soul is man, then Aquinas would
hold the same position as Plato.</i></b> <b><i>Moreover, if the soul is man,
then the transmigration of the human soul into another body would be possible.
Accordingly, this article is important not only because it differentiates
Aquinas from Plato but also because its emphasis upon the importance of matter
to human nature strengthens our understanding of Thomistic hylomorphism.</i></b> 
<br>
&nbsp;<b><br>
<big>I answer that,</big> [If the soul is man, then bodily acts would not
be the act of the person.] . . . But it has been shown above (A3) that sensation 
is not the operation of the soul only. Since, then, sensation is an operation 
of man, but not proper to him, it is clear that man is not a soul only, but
something composed of soul and body. <i>Plato</i>, through supposing that
sensation was proper to the soul, could maintain man to be a soul making
use of the body.</b> <br>
</p>
&nbsp; <br>
<p> </p>
<p><b>I.75.6: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS INCORRUPTIBLE?</b> </p>
<p><b><i>N.B. If the soul is incorruptible, then it is immortal because existence
cannot be separated from what is incorruptible. Aquinas' argument that the
human soul is incorruptible relies upon the ideas that nothing is divisible
from itself and that the human soul and its subsistence are one.</i></b> </p>
<p><b><big>I answer that,</big> We must assert that the intellectual principle
which we call the human soul is incorruptible. [For since the mode of activity 
reveals the mode of existence, the ability of the human soul to act independently 
of matter (as it does when it knows universals) means that the soul has an
existence independent of matter, i.e. the human soul subsists.&nbsp; <br>
</b></p>
<p><b>If the human soul subsists, then separation from matter by death will
not affect its existence. If death does not affect the existence/subsistence 
of the soul, then subsisting souls are incorruptible/immortal] . . . <i>For</i> 
it is clear that what belongs to a thing by virtue of itself is inseparable 
from it; but subsistence belongs to those forms which have an act that is
NOT in and through matter by virtue of itself. <br>
</b></p>
<p><b>Therefore, matter acquires actual existence as it acquires the form;
while it is corrupted so far as the form is separated from it. But it is
impossible for a form to be separated from itself [and its own act of subsisting];
and therefore it is impossible for a subsistent form to cease to exist.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>... Moreover ...a sign [that this argument is right may be taken] from
the fact that everything naturally aspires to existence after its own manner.
Now, in things that have knowledge, desire ensues upon knowledge. The senses
indeed do not know existence, except under the conditions of "here" and "now,"
whereas the intellect apprehends existence absolutely, and for all time;
so that everything that has an intellect naturally desires always to exist.
[<i>And, if] a natural desire cannot be in vain, . . .</i>every intellectual
substance is incorruptible.</b> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.75.7: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS AN ANGEL?</b> 
</p>
<p><b><i>N.B. If the human soul is subsistent, then it seems that it is angelic.
So the question arises whether human beings are really angels. This article's
argument relies upon the individuating character of quantified matter in
order to explain why there are many individuals within the human species
while there is only one individual within each of the many species of angels.</i></b> 
</p>
<p><b><i>ON THE CONTRARY</i>, Things which have different natural operations 
are of different species. <i>[ACTIVITIES REVEAL NATURE</i>.] But the natural 
operations of the soul and of an angel are different; since, as Dionysius 
says (Div. Nom. vii), "Angelic minds have simple and blessed intelligence, 
not gathering their knowledge of Divine things from visible things." Subsequently 
he says the contrary to this of the soul. Therefore the soul and an angel 
are not of the same species.</b> </p>
<p><b><big>I answer that,</big> angels and human souls cannot belong to the
same species; for [human souls, as the substantial form activating matter
into living bodies, have a relation to matter that enable many human beings
to belong to the same species. Since angels are not substantial forms activating 
matter into bodies, they cannot be multiplied in this way. Instead, every 
angel belongs to its own species.] . . . For a separate form cannot be understood
otherwise than as one of a single species; thus, supposing a separate whiteness
to exist, it could only be one; forasmuch as one whiteness does not differ
from another except as in this or that subject. . . [Hence, since the human
soul differs from angels in having a relationship to matter, human souls
and angels cannot belong to the same species of immaterial entities.]</b>
