<P>I<B>NTRODUCTION:</B></P>

<P>What is the meaning of life? What is the significance of happiness?
What are the institutions that facilitate successful living? Can anyone
know the truth about human life? Do humans have souls? Is it possible to
know for sure whether animals think and whether computers are conscious?
These questions set the parameters for our study of the Philosophy of the
Person. The Philosophy of the Person has a long history, a history which
when understood illuminates various key concepts and illustrates the philosophical
method. In addition, historical study of the Philosophy of the Person reveals
the perennial nature of discussions about the existence and character of
the human soul.</P>

<P>OBJECTIVES:</P>

<P>1. To understand the paradigmatic characterizations of human nature
and human happiness in both its western and eastern foundations. </P>

<P>2. To identify the perennial arguments and relevance of the materialistic,
dualistic and hylomorphic characterizations of human nature and happiness
in ancient, medieval, modern and contemporary western history. </P>

<P>3. To develop the skills of philosophical analysis and disputation.</P>

<P>4. To develop sensitivity to the American cultural perspective on the
soul, human happiness and the nature of the human person. TEXTS: </P>

<P>Course packet; Phaedo by Plato; Meditations on First Philosophy by Rene
Descartes; A Rulebook for Arguments by Anthony Weston.</P>

<P>GRADING</P>

<P>60% three essay exams; 20% class participation and quizzes; 20% cultural
artefact presentation</P>

<P>CULTURAL ARTEFACT PRESENTATION</P>

<P>Themes central to the Philosophy of the Person are found in various
popular songs, movies and advertising. Present to the class one of these
themes, e.g. materialism, dualism or nature of human happiness. VCRs and
cassette players will be available. If a song or an excerpt from a movie
or a television show is shown, the lyrics or the video's dialogue must
be printed out and distributed to the class. </P>

<P>PROPER PROCEDURE TO FOLLOW</P>

<P>1. Pass out copies of any dialogue whether in a song or in a video excerpt.</P>

<P>2. Play the song or the video excerpt; show the advertisement. </P>

<P>3. Ask the class to identify the Philosophy of Person theme present
in the song, video or advertisement. Is only one theme expressed by the
artefact?</P>

<P>4. Explain the theme that you identified the artefact as expressing.
</P>

<P>5. Present an argument about whether you consider American culture to
be dominated by the theme captured by the artefact. </P>

<P>5. Hand in a summary of your presentation (one typed page). The summary
should (1) identify the artefact and its theme and (2) present your argument
about the prevalence of that theme within American culture.</P>

<P>Artefact grading will be based upon presentation interest, clarity,
argumentation and depth of insight into American culture.</P>

to ancient materialism and relativism. Focus Questions: (1) Identify the

the contemporary saying that &quot;nothing is true for everyone&quot; or

likely? </P>

<P>2. From middle p. 506 to top 507. Focus question: If the sayings of

<P>ASIGNMENT SHEET # 6</P>

<P>Due Tuesday, March 26th: Minds, Brains and Evolution. Video, &quot;The
Brain: Universe Within&quot; (#6636), and Class discussion.</P>

<P>Due Thursday, March 28th: Logic Quiz on Refutations and Can Computers
Think? Read Searle, &quot;Can Computers Think?&quot; pp.63-69 in the Blue
Book. Searle is arguing against the claim that computers think; because
he thinks that only biological systems---like the human brain-- -can sustain
thought. His argument relies upon a distinction between the semantics and
the syntax of a language or symbols. Semantics is the meaning of a language
or a symbol; syntax is the grammar of a language or the application of
certain rules. Syntactical processes are purely &quot;formal&quot; which
means that their functions do not depend upon the meaning of the symbols
manipulated; syntax is independent of semantics. Focus Questions: (1) How
does the Chinese Room thought experiment argue that syntactical processes
can occur independently of semantics? (2) Are there any other arguments
that computers cannot think? (3) If Searle is right about computers, then
is he also necessarily right about &quot;brains causing minds&quot;? (4)
How could Aquinas and Descartes argue against Searle's materialism?</P>
