<p><strong>I.78.1: WHETHER THERE ARE TO BE DISTINGUISHED FIVE GENERA OF POWERS IN
THE SOUL?	</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, The Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 3), "The powers are the vegetative, the
sensitive, the appetitive, the locomotion, and the intellectual."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, There are five genera of powers of the soul, as above numbered. Of these, three are
called souls, and four are called modes of living. <strong>The reason of this</strong> diversity lies in the various souls being
distinguished accordingly as the operation of the soul transcends the operation of the corporeal nature in
various ways; <strong>for</strong> the whole corporeal nature is subject to the soul, and is related to it as its matter and
instrument. There exists, <strong>therefore</strong>, an operation of the soul which so far exceeds the corporeal nature that
it is not even performed by any corporeal organ; and such is the operation of the "rational soul." Below
this, there is another operation of the soul, which is indeed performed [in an organ, but not by a
biochemical process] and this is the operation of the "sensitive soul"; <strong>  </strong> although [neural processes] are
required for the work of the senses, they are not required in such a way that [sensation is reduced to those
processes]. The lowest of the operations of the soul is that which is performed in and by a corporeal organ
[e.g. nutrition, oxygenation of the blood]. Yet [even these purely corporeal processes] transcends the
operation of [inanimate matter]; <strong>because</strong> the movements of bodies are caused by an extrinsic principle,
while these operations are from an intrinsic principle; <strong>for</strong> this is common to all the operations of the soul;
<strong>since</strong> every animate thing, in some way, moves itself. ....

<p>	Now the powers of the soul are distinguished generically by their objects. <strong>For</strong> the higher a power
is, the more universal is the object to which it extends, as we have said above (Q77, A3, ad 4). But the
object of the soul's operation may be considered in a triple order. <strong>For</strong> in the soul there is a power the object
of which is only the body that is united to that soul; the powers of this genus are called "vegetative" for the
vegetative power acts only on the body to which the soul is united. There is another genus in the powers of
the soul, which genus regards a more universal object---namely, every sensible body, not only the body to
which the soul is united. And there is yet another genus in the powers of the soul, which genus regards a
still more universal object---namely, not only the sensible body, but all being in universal. <strong>Therefore</strong> it is
evident that the latter two genera of the soul's powers have an operation in regard not merely to that which
is united to them, but also to something extrinsic. Now, <strong>since</strong> whatever operates must in some way be
united to the object about which it operates, it follows of necessity that this something extrinsic, which is
the object of the soul's operation, must be related to the soul in a twofold manner. First, inasmuch as this
something extrinsic has a natural aptitude to be united to the soul, and to be by its likeness in the soul. In
this way there are two kinds of powers ---namely, the "sensitive" in regard to the less common object---the
sensible body; and the "intellectual," in regard to the most common object---universal being. Secondly,
forasmuch as the soul itself has an inclination and tendency to the something extrinsic. And in this way
there are again two kinds of powers in the soul: one---the "appetitive"---in respect of which the soul is
referred to something extrinsic as to an end, which is first in the intention; the other---the "locomotive"
power---in respect of which the soul is referred to something extrinsic as to the term of its operation and
movement; <strong>for</strong> every animal is moved for the purpose of realizing its desires and intentions.

<p>	The modes of living are distinguished according to the degrees of living things. There are some
living things in which there exists only vegetative power, as the plants. There are others in which with the
vegetative there exists also the sensitive, but not the locomotive power; such as immovable animals, as
shellfish. There are others which besides this have locomotive powers, as perfect animals, which require
many things <strong>for</strong> their life, and <strong>consequently</strong> movement to seek necessaries of life from a distance. And
there are some living things which with these have intellectual power---namely, men. But the appetitive
power does not constitute a degree of living things; <strong>because</strong> wherever there is sense there is also appetite
(De Anima ii, 3).

<p><strong>I.78.2: WHETHER THE PARTS OF THE VEGETATIVE SOUL ARE FITTINGLY
DESCRIBED AS THE NUTRITIVE, AUGMENTATIVE, AND GENERATIVE?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, The vegetative part has three powers. <strong>For</strong> the vegetative part, as we have said (A1),
has for its object the body itself, living by the soul; for which body a triple operation of the soul is required.
One is whereby it acquires existence, and to this is directed the "generative" power. Another is whereby the
living body acquires its due quantity; to this is directed the "augmentative" power. Another is whereby the
body of a living thing is preserved in its existence and in its due quantity; to this is directed the "nutritive"
power.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.78.3: WHETHER [THERE ARE] FIVE EXTERIOR SENSES?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, ....	the number and distinction of the exterior senses [are] ascribed to that
which belongs to the senses properly and through and in themselves. Now, sense is a passive power, and is
naturally immuted by the exterior sensible. <strong>Therefore</strong> the exterior cause of such immutation is what is "per
se" perceived by the sense, and according to the diversity of that exterior cause are the sensitive powers
diversified.

<p>	Now, <em>immutation</em> is of two kinds, one <em>natural</em>, the other <em>immaterial</em>. <em>Natural immutation</em> takes
place by the form of the immuter being received according to its natural existence, into the thing immuted,
as heat is received into the thing heated. Whereas <em>immaterial</em> <em>immutation</em> takes place by the form of the
immuter being received, according to an immaterial mode of existence, into the thing immuted, as the form
of color is received into the pupil which does not thereby become colored. Now, for the operation of the
senses, a <em>immaterial immutation</em> is required, whereby an intention of the sensible form is effected in the
sensile organ. Otherwise, if a <em>natural immutation</em> alone sufficed for the sense's action, all natural bodies
would feel when they undergo alteration.

<p><strong>I.78.4: WHETHER THE INTERIOR SENSES ARE SUITABLY DISTINGUISHED?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, <em>Avicenna</em> (De Anima iv, 1) assigns five interior sensitive powers; namely,
"communal sense, phantasy, imagination, and the estimative and memorative powers."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, As nature does not fail in necessary things, there must needs be as many actions of
the sensitive soul as may suffice for the life of a perfect animal. If any of these actions cannot be reduced to
the same one principle, they must be assigned to diverse powers; <strong>since</strong> a power of the soul is nothing else
than the proximate principle of the soul's operation.

<p>	Now we must observe that for the life of a perfect animal, the animal should apprehend a thing not
only at the actual time of sensation, but also when it is absent. Otherwise, <strong>since</strong> animal motion and action
follow apprehension, an animal would not be moved to seek something absent: the contrary of which we
may observe specially in perfect animals, which are moved by progression, <strong>for</strong> they are moved towards
something apprehended and absent. <strong>Therefore</strong> an animal through the sensitive soul must not only receive
the species of sensible things, when it is actually affected by them, but it must also retain and preserve
them. Now to receive and retain are, in corporeal things, reduced to diverse principles; <strong>for</strong> moist things are
apt to receive, but retain with difficulty, while it is the reverse with dry things. <strong>therefore</strong>, <strong>since</strong> the
sensitive power is the act of a corporeal organ, <strong>it follows that</strong> the power which receives the species of
sensible things must be distinct from the power which preserves them.

<p>	Again we must observe that if an animal were moved by pleasing and disagreeable things only as
affecting the sense, there would be no need to suppose that an animal has a power besides the apprehension
of those forms which the senses perceive, and in which the animal takes pleasure, or from which it shrinks
with horror. But the animal needs to seek or to avoid certain things, not only <strong>because</strong> they are pleasing or
otherwise to the senses, but also on account of other advantages and uses, or disadvantages: just as the
sheep runs away when it sees a wolf, not on account of its color or shape, but as a natural enemy: and
again a bird gathers together straws, not <strong>because</strong> they are pleasant to the sense, but <strong>because</strong> they are useful
for building its nest. Animals, <strong>therefore</strong>, need to perceive such intentions, which the exterior sense does not
perceive. And some distinct principle is necessary for this; <strong>since</strong> the perception of sensible forms comes by
an immutation caused by the sensible, which is not the case with the perception of those intentions.

<p>	<strong>Thus</strong>, <strong>therefore</strong>, for the reception of sensible forms, the external senses and the communal sense
are appointed, and of their distinction we shall speak farther on (ad 1,2). But for the retention and
preservation of these forms, the "phantasy" or "imagination" is appointed; which are the same, <strong>for</strong> phantasy
or imagination is as it were a storehouse of forms received through the senses. Furthermore, for the
apprehension of intentions which are not received through the senses, the "estimative" power is appointed:
and for the preservation thereof, the "memorative" power, which is a storehouse of such-like intentions. A
sign of which we have in the fact that the principle of memory in animals is found in some such intention,
<strong>for</strong> instance, that something is harmful or otherwise. And the very formality of the past, which memory
observes, is to be reckoned among these intentions.

<p>	Now, we must observe that as to sensible forms there is no difference between man and other
animals; <strong>for</strong> they are similarly immuted by the extrinsic sensible. But there is a difference as to the above
intentions: <strong>for</strong> other animals perceive these intentions only by some natural instinct, while man perceives
them by means of coalition of ideas. <strong>Therefore</strong> the power by which in other animals is called the natural
estimative, in man is called the "cogitative," which by some sort of collation discovers these intentions.
<strong>Therefore</strong> it is also called the "particular reason," to which medical men assign a certain particular organ,
namely, the middle part of the head: <strong>for</strong> it compares individual intentions, just as the intellectual reason
compares universal intentions. As to the memorative power, man has not only memory, as other animals
have in the sudden recollection of the past; but also "reminiscence" by syllogistically, as it were, seeking for
a recollection of the past by the application of individual intentions. <em>Avicenna</em>, however, assigns between
the estimative and the imaginative, a fifth power, which combines and divides imaginary forms: as when
from the imaginary form of gold, and imaginary form of a mountain, we compose the one form of a golden
mountain, which we have never seen. But this operation is not to be found in animals other than man, in
whom the imaginative power suffices thereto. To man also does <em>Averroes</em> attribute this action in his book
De sensu et sensibilibus (viii). So there is no need to assign more than four interior powers of the sensitive
part---namely, the communal sense, the imagination, and the estimative and memorative powers.
