<p><strong>I.75.1: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IMMATERIAL? </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 3: Further, between the mover and the moved there must be contact. But contact is only
between bodies. <strong>Since</strong>, <strong>therefore</strong>, the soul moves the body, it seems that the soul must be a material body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that,</strong> To seek the nature of the soul, we must premise that the soul is defined as the first
principle of life of those things which live: <strong>for</strong> we call living things "animate," [*i.e. having a soul], and
those things which have no life, "inanimate." Now life is shown principally by two actions, knowledge and
movement. 

<p>	<em>The philosophers of old</em>, not being able to rise above their imagination, supposed that the principle
of these actions was something corporeal: <strong>for</strong> they asserted that only bodies were real things; and that what
is not corporeal is nothing: <strong>hence</strong> they maintained that the soul is something corporeal. This opinion can be
proved to be false in many ways; but we shall make use of only one <strong>proof</strong>, based on universal and certain
principles, which shows clearly that the soul is not a body.

<p>	Now, though matter may be a principle of life as the heart is a principle of life in an animal,
nothing material can be the first principle of life. <strong>For</strong> it is clear that to be a principle of life, or to be alive,
does not belong to matter as such; <strong>since</strong>, if that were the case, all material things would be alive. <strong>Therefore</strong>
matter---which is able to be a living thing or even a principle of life---is as such only  <em>potentially</em> a living
body. When it is <em>actually</em> a body, some principle must be activating its potency for being a living body.
[That principle of activation is the soul.] Accordingly, the soul as the first principle of life [does not
consists of matter; it is rather immaterial so that it can animate matter into a living body.] 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 3: [Not all contact is between bodies.] There are two kinds of contact; of "quantity,"
and of "power." By the former a body can be touched only by a body; by the latter a body can be touched
by an incorporeal thing, which moves that body.

<p><strong><strong>I.75.2: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS SOMETHING SUBSISTENT?</strong>

<p><strong>[Since subsistence means to exist on one's own, this article is asking whether the human soul has the
type of existence that enables it to exist on its own, i.e. independently of matter. If the human soul
does not subsist, then it exists only when making a body be alive.]</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 3: Further, if the soul were subsistent, it would have some operation apart from the body. But
it has no operation apart from the body, not even that of understanding: <strong>for</strong> the act of understanding does
not take place without a <em>sense image</em>, which cannot exist apart from the body. <strong>Therefore</strong> the human soul is
not something subsistent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, It must necessarily be allowed that the principle of intellectual operation which we
call the soul, is a principle both incorporeal and subsistent. <strong>For</strong> it is clear that by means of the intellect man
can have knowledge of all corporeal things. Now whatever knows certain things cannot have any of them in
its own nature; <strong>because</strong> that which is in it naturally would impede the knowledge of anything else. <strong>Thus</strong> we
observe that [none can sense the temperature of water when the hand is as warm as the water].<strong> Hence, </strong>if
the intellectual principle contained the nature of a body it would be unable to know all bodies. <strong>Therefore,
</strong>since every body has its own determinate nature, it is impossible for the intellectual principle to be a body.
It is likewise impossible for it to understand by means of a bodily organ; <strong>since</strong> the determinate nature of
that organ would impede knowledge of all bodies; as when a certain determinate color is not only in the
pupil of the eye, but also in a glass vase, the liquid in the vase seems to be of that same color.

<p>	<strong>Therefore</strong> the intellectual principle which we call the mind or the intellect has an operation in and
through itself apart from the body. Now only that which subsists can have an operation in and through
itself. <strong>For</strong> nothing can operate but what is actual: <strong>for</strong> which reason we do not say that heat imparts heat,
but that what is hot gives heat. We must conclude, <strong>therefore</strong>, that the human soul, which is called the
intellect or the mind, is something incorporeal and subsistent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 3: The body is necessary for the action of the intellect, not as its origin of action, but on
the part of the object; <strong>for</strong> the sense image is to the intellect what color is to the sight. Neither does such a
dependence on the body prove the intellect to be non-subsistent; otherwise <strong>it would follow</strong> that an animal is
non-subsistent, <strong>since</strong> it requires external objects of the senses in order to perform its act of perception.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>ARTICLE COMMENTARY:</strong> 

<p>	In this article Aquinas relies upon the principle that ACTION REVEALS NATURE, i.e. a thing
acts according to its nature. Thus, if the intellect has an act that is independent of matter, then it must exist
independently of matter (it must be its own subsistence). The intellect has such an act because its ability to
know all material things presupposes that it does not consists of matter; the intellect is not the brain. This
article thus presents a key argument against materialism.

<p>	Another argument based upon Thomistic principles is that since matter is the principle of
individuation, universals can neither exist in matter nor be known by a material entity. Therefore, the
intellectual soul which knows universals cannot be material. See I.75.5 for Aquinas' more detailed
argument.

<p><strong>I.75.3: WHETHER THE SOULS OF BRUTE ANIMALS ARE SUBSISTENT?</strong>

<p><strong>[If animal souls are subsistent, then it would be possible for animals to be immortal.]</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 1: It would seem that the souls of brute animals are subsistent. <strong>For</strong> man is of the same 'genus'
as other animals; and, as we have just shown (A2), the soul of man is subsistent. <strong>Therefore</strong> the souls of
other animals are subsistent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 3: Further, the soul of brute animals moves the body. But the body is not a mover, but is
moved. <strong>Therefore</strong> the soul of brute animals has an operation apart from the body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, <em>The ancient philosophers</em> made no distinction between sense and intellect, and
referred both a corporeal principle, as has been said (A1). <em>Plato</em>, however, drew a distinction between
intellect and sense; yet he referred both to an incorporeal principle, maintaining that sensing, just as
understanding, belongs to the soul as such. From this <strong>it follows that</strong> even the souls of brute animals are
subsistent. But <em>Aristotle</em> held that of the operations of the soul, understanding alone is performed without a
corporeal organ. <em></em>

<p><em>	On the other hand</em>, sensation and the consequent operations of the sensitive soul are evidently
accompanied with change in the body; <strong>thus</strong> in the act of vision, the pupil of the eye is affected by a
reflection of color: and so with the other senses. <strong>Hence</strong> it is clear that the sensitive soul has no act in and
through itself, and that every operation of the sensitive soul belongs to the composite. <strong>Therefore</strong> we
conclude that <strong>since</strong> the souls of brute animals have no acts in and through themselves, they are not
subsistent. <strong>For</strong> the operation of anything follows the mode of its being.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 1: Although man is of the same "genus" as other animals, he is of a different "species."
Specific difference is derived from the difference of form; nor does every difference of form necessarily
imply a diversity of "genus."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 3: Motive power is of <em>two</em> kinds. <em>One</em>, the appetitive power, commands motion. The
operation of this power in the sensitive soul is not apart from the body; <strong>for</strong> anger, joy, and passions of a
like nature are accompanied by a change in the body. The <em>other</em> motive power is that which executes
motion in adapting the members for obeying the appetite; and the act of this power does not consist in
moving, but in being moved. Whence it is clear that to move is not an act of the sensitive soul without the
body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.75.4: WHETHER THE SOUL IS MAN?</strong>

<p><strong>[If Aquinas would argue that the soul is man, then Aquinas would hold the same position as Plato.}</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 1: It would seem that the soul is man. <strong>For</strong> it is written (2 Cor. 4:16): "Though our outward
man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." But that which is within man is the soul.
<strong>Therefore</strong> the soul is the inward man.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, Augustine (De Civ. Dei xix, 3) commends Varro as holding "that man is
not a mere soul, nor a mere body; but both soul and body."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, The assertion "the soul is man," can be taken in <em>two</em> senses. <em>First</em>, that man is a
soul; though this particular man, Socrates, <strong>for</strong> instance, is not a soul, but composed of soul and body. I say
this, <strong>for</strong> as much as some held that the form alone belongs to the species; while matter is part of the
individual, and not the species. This cannot be true; <strong>for</strong> to the nature of the species belongs what the
definition signifies; and in natural things the definition does not signify the form only, but the form and the
matter. <strong>Hence</strong> in natural things the matter is part of the species; not, indeed, <em>signate matter</em>, which is the
principle of individuality; but the <em>common matter</em>. <strong>For</strong> as it belongs to the notion of this particular man to
be composed of this soul, of this flesh, and of these bones; so it belongs to the notion of man to be
composed of soul, flesh, and bones; <strong>for</strong> whatever belongs in common to the substance of all the individuals
contained under a given species, must belong to the substance of the species.

<p>	It may also be understood in this sense, that this soul is this man; and this could be held if it were
supposed that the operation of the sensitive soul were proper to it, apart from the body; <strong>because</strong> in that
case all the operations which are attributed to man would belong to the soul only; and whatever performs
the operations proper to a thing, is that thing; <strong>therefore</strong> that which performs the operations of a man is
man. But it has been shown above (A3) that sensation is not the operation of the soul only. <strong>Since</strong>, then,
sensation is an operation of man, but not proper to him, it is clear that man is not a soul only, but
something composed of soul and body. <em>Plato</em>, through supposing that sensation was proper to the soul,
could maintain man to be a soul making use of the body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 1: According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix, 8), a thing seems to be chiefly what is
principle in it; <strong>thus</strong> what the governor of a state does, the state is said to do. In this way sometimes what is
principle in man is said to be man; sometimes, indeed, the intellectual part which, in accordance with truth,
is called the "inward" man; and sometimes the sensitive part with the body is called man in the opinion of
those whose observation does not go beyond the senses. And this is called the "outward" man.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.75.5: WHETHER THE SOUL IS COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM?</strong>

<p>	

<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, The soul has no matter. We may consider this question in two ways. <em>First,</em> from the
notion of a soul in general; <strong>for</strong> it belongs to the notion of a soul to be the form of a body. Now, <em>either</em> it is a
form by virtue of itself, in its entirety, <em>or</em> by virtue of some part of itself. If by virtue of itself in its entirety,
then it is impossible that any part of it should be matter, if by matter we understand something purely
potential: <strong>for</strong> a form, as such, is an act; and that which is purely potentiality cannot be part of an act, <strong>since</strong>
potentiality is repugnant to actuality as being opposite thereto. If, however, it be a form by virtue of a part
of itself, then we call that part the soul: and that matter, which it actualizes first, we call "[a living] body." 

<p>	<em>Secondly</em>, we may proceed from the specific notion of the human soul inasmuch as it is intellectual.
<strong>For</strong> it is clear that whatever is received into something is received according to the condition of the
recipient. Now a thing is known in as far as its form is in the knower. But the intellectual soul [understands
the universal natures of things]: for instance, it knows a stone according to its nature as a stone [[as it
knows wax according to its nature as wax]]; and <strong>therefore</strong> the form of a stone universally considered is in
the intellectual soul. <strong>...</strong><em>But if the intellectual soul were composed of matter and form, the forms of things
would be received into it as individuals, and so it would only know the individual</em>: just as it happens with
the sensitive powers which receive forms in a corporeal organ; <strong>since</strong> matter is the principle by which forms
are individualized. It follows, <strong>therefore</strong>, that the intellectual soul, and every intellectual substance which
has knowledge of [universals] is exempt from composition of matter and form.

<p><strong>I.75.6: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS INCORRUPTIBLE? </strong>

<p>[<strong>If the soul is incorruptible, then it is immortal because what is incorruptible cannot dissipate or be
destroyed.]</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 3: Further, nothing is without its own proper operation. But the operation proper to the soul,
which is to understand through a sense image, cannot be without the body. <strong>For</strong> the soul understands
nothing without a sense image; and there is no sense image without the body as the Philosopher says (De
Anima i, 1). <strong>Therefore</strong> the soul cannot survive the dissolution of the body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, We must assert that the intellectual principle which we call the human soul is
incorruptible. <strong>For</strong> a thing may be corrupted in two ways---through itself and through another. Now it is
impossible <strong>for</strong> any substance to be generated or corrupted through another. .... <strong>for</strong> generation and
corruption belong to a thing, just as existence belongs to it, which is acquired by generation and lost by
corruption. <strong>Therefore</strong>, whatever has existence through itself cannot be generated or corrupted except
through itself; while things which do not subsist, such as properties and material forms, acquire existence
or lose it through the generation or corruption of composite things. Now it was shown above (AA2,3) that
the souls of brutes are not self-subsistent, whereas the human soul is; so that the souls of brutes are
corrupted, when their bodies are corrupted; while the human soul could not be corrupted unless it were
corrupted "per se." This, indeed, is impossible, not only as regards the human soul, but also as regards
anything subsistent that is a form alone. <strong><em>For</strong> it is clear that what belongs to a thing by virtue of itself is
inseparable from it; but subsistence belongs to those forms which have an act that is NOT in and through
matter by virtue of itself.</em> <strong>Therefore</strong> matter acquires actual existence as it acquires the form; while it is
corrupted so far as the form is separated from it. But it is impossible <strong>for</strong> a form to be separated from itself;
and <strong>therefore</strong> it is impossible <strong>for</strong> a subsistent form to cease to exist.

<p>	... Moreover ...a sign [that this argument is right may be taken] from the fact that everything
naturally aspires to existence after its own manner. Now, in things that have knowledge, desire ensues upon
knowledge. The senses indeed do not know existence, except under the conditions of "here" and "now,"
whereas the intellect apprehends existence absolutely, and for all time; so that everything that has an
intellect naturally desires always to exist. <em>But a natural desire cannot be in vain.</em> <strong>Therefore</strong> every
intellectual substance is incorruptible.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 3: To understand through a sense image is the proper operation of the soul by virtue of
its union with the body. After separation from the body it will have another mode of understanding, similar
to other substances separated from bodies, as will appear later on (Q89, A1).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.75.7: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS AN ANGEL?</strong>

<p>[<strong>If Aquinas were to answer "yes," then human beings would become angels after death.]</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 3: Further, it seems that the soul does not differ from an angel except in its union with the
body. But as the body is outside the essence of the soul, it seems that it does not belong to its species.
<strong>Therefore</strong> the soul and angel are of the same species.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, Things which have different natural operations are of different species.
<em>[ACTIVITIES REVEAL NATURE</em>.] But the natural operations of the soul and of an angel are different;
<strong>since</strong>, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii), "Angelic minds have simple and blessed intelligence, not
gathering their knowledge of Divine things from visible things." Subsequently he says the contrary to this of
the soul. <strong>Therefore</strong> the soul and an angel are not of the same species.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, angels and human souls cannot belong to the same species; <strong>for</strong> in incorporeal
substances there cannot be diversity of number without diversity of species and inequality of nature;
<strong>because</strong>, as they are not composed of matter and form, but are subsistent forms, it is clear that there is
necessarily among them a diversity of species. <strong>For</strong> a separate form cannot be understood otherwise than as
one of a single species; <strong>thus</strong>, supposing a separate whiteness to exist, it could only be one; forasmuch as
one whiteness does not differ from another except as in this or that subject. [In other words,<em> human beings
differ in their bodies but not in their species; while angels, since they are immaterial substances, cannot
differ except by being different species.] </em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 3: The body is not of the essence of the soul; but the soul by the nature of its essence
can be united to the body, so that, properly speaking, not the soul alone, but the "composite," is the species.
And the very fact that the soul in a certain way requires the body for its operation, <strong>proves</strong> that the soul is
endowed with a grade of intellectuality inferior to that of an angel, who is not united to a body.

<p><strong>I.76.1: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS
FORM? [This is an important question because granted that the intellect can act and exist
independently of matter, it is possible that individual human beings lack such an intellect and that as a
result individual human beings are not immortal. This question was big during the Middle Ages and
is now important again since Buddhism and Hinduism makes us wonder whether reincarnation  is
possible and whether it is possible for the self to continue to exist as the self after death. If Aquinas is
successful in identifying the intellect as being within the soul of each person and if he is successful in
identifying the human soul as the form activating matter into the human body, then he proves that
human beings can be personally immortal without being reincarnated. This proof begins in this article
and is completed in articles I.76.2-3-4-5-8]</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 2: Further, every form is determined according to the nature of the matter of which it is the
form; otherwise no proportion would be required between matter and form. <strong>Therefore</strong> if the intellect were
united to the body as its form, <strong>since</strong> every body has a determinate nature, <strong>it would follow</strong> that the intellect
has a determinate nature; and <strong>thus</strong>, it would not be capable of knowing all things, as is clear from what has
been said (Q75, A2); which is contrary to the nature of the intellect. <strong>Therefore</strong> the intellect is not united to
the body as its form.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 3: Further, whatever receptive power is an act of a body, receives a form materially and
individually; <strong>for</strong> what is received must be received according to the condition of the receiver. But the form
of the thing understood is not received into the intellect materially and individually, but rather immaterially
and universally: otherwise the intellect would not be capable of the knowledge of immaterial and universal
objects, but only of individuals, like the senses. <strong>Therefore</strong> the intellect is not united to the body as its form.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 4: Further, power and action have the same subject; <strong>for</strong> the same subject is what can, and
does, act. But the intellectual action is not the action of a body, as appears from above (Q75, A2).
<strong>Therefore</strong> neither is the intellectual faculty a power of the body. But virtue or power cannot be more
abstract or more simple than the essence from which the faculty or power is derived. <strong>Therefore</strong> neither is
the substance of the intellect the form of a body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, We must assert that the intellect which is the principle of intellectual operation is
the form of the human body. <strong>For</strong> that whereby primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the
act is to be attributed: <strong>for</strong> instance, that whereby a body is primarily healed is health, and that whereby the
soul knows primarily is knowledge; <strong>hence</strong> health is a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the
soul. The reason is <strong>because</strong> nothing acts except so far as it is in act; <strong>therefore</strong> a thing acts by that whereby
it is in act. Now it is clear that the first thing by which the body lives is the soul. And as life appears
through various operations in different degrees of living things, that whereby we primarily perform each of
all these vital actions is the soul. <strong>For</strong> the soul is the primary principle of our nourishment, sensation, and
local movement; and likewise of our understanding. <strong>Therefore</strong> this principle by which we primarily
understand, whether it be called the intellect or the intellectual soul, is the form of the body. This is the
demonstration used by <em>Aristotle</em> (De Anima ii, 2).

<p>	But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of the body he must first explain how it
is that this action of understanding is the action of this particular man; <strong>for</strong> each one is conscious that it is
himself who understands. Now an action may be attributed to anyone in three ways, as is clear from the
Philosopher (Phys. v, 1); <strong>for</strong> a thing is said to move or act, either by virtue of its whole self, <strong>for</strong> instance,
as a physician heals; or by virtue of a part, as a man sees by his eye; or through an accidental quality, as
when we say that something that is white builds, <strong>because</strong> it is accidental to the builder to be white. So
when we say that Socrates or <em>Plato</em> understands, it is clear that this is not attributed to him accidentally;
<strong>since</strong> it is ascribed to him as man, which is predicated of him essentially. We must <strong>therefore</strong> say either that
Socrates understands by virtue of his whole self, as <em>Plato</em> maintained, holding that man is an intellectual
soul; or that intelligence is a part of Socrates. The first cannot stand, as was shown above (Q75, A4), <strong>for
this reason</strong>, that it is one and the same man who is conscious both that he understands, and that he senses.
But one cannot sense without a body: <strong>therefore</strong> the body must be some part of man. It follows <strong>therefore</strong>
that the intellect by which Socrates understands is a part of Socrates, so that in some way it is united to the
body of Socrates.

<p>	The Commentator held that this union is through the <em>intelligible species</em>, as having a double
subject, in the possible intellect, and in the sense images which are in the corporeal organs. <strong>Thus</strong> through
the <em>intelligible species</em> the possible intellect is linked to the body of this or that particular man. But this link
or union does not sufficiently explain the fact, that the act of the intellect is the act of Socrates. This can be
clearly seen from comparison with the sensitive faculty, from which <em>Aristotle</em> proceeds to consider things
relating to the intellect. <strong>For</strong> the relation of sense images to the intellect is like the relation of colors to the
sense of sight, as he says De Anima iii, 5,7. <strong>Therefore</strong>, as the species of colors are in the sight, so are the
species of sense images in the possible intellect. Now it is clear that <strong>because</strong> the colors, the images of
which are in the sight, are on a wall, the action of seeing is not attributed to the wall: <strong>for</strong> we do not say that
the wall sees, but rather that it is seen. <strong>Therefore</strong>, from the fact that the species of sense images are in the
possible intellect, it does not follow that Socrates, in whom are the sense images, understands, but that he
or his sense images are understood.

<p>	Some, however, tried to maintain that the intellect is united to the body as its motor; and <strong>hence</strong> that
the intellect and body form one thing so that the act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole. This is,
however, absurd <strong>for</strong> <strong>many reasons</strong>. First, <strong>because</strong> the intellect does not move the body except through the
appetite, the movement of which presupposes the operation of the intellect. The reason <strong>therefore</strong> why
Socrates understands is not <strong>because</strong> he is moved by his intellect, but rather, contrariwise, he is moved by
his intellect <strong>because</strong> he understands. Secondly, <strong>because</strong> <strong>since</strong> Socrates is an individual in a nature of one
essence composed of matter and form, if the intellect be not the form, <strong>it follows that</strong> it must be outside the
essence, and then the intellect is the whole Socrates as a motor to the thing moved. Whereas the act of
intellect remains in the agent, and does not pass into something else, as does the action of heating.
<strong>Therefore</strong> the action of understanding cannot be attributed to Socrates <strong>for</strong> the reason that he is moved by
his intellect. Thirdly, <strong>because</strong> the action of a motor is never attributed to the thing moved, except as to an
instrument; as the action of a carpenter to a saw. <strong>Therefore</strong> if understanding is attributed to Socrates, as
the action of what moves him, <strong>it follows that</strong> it is attributed to him as to an instrument. This is contrary to
the teaching of the Philosopher, who holds that understanding is not possible through a corporeal
instrument (De Anima iii, 4). Fourthly, <strong>because</strong>, although the action of a part be attributed to the whole, as
the action of the eye is attributed to a man; yet it is never attributed to another part, except perhaps
indirectly; <strong>for</strong> we do not say that the hand sees <strong>because</strong> the eye sees. <strong>Therefore</strong> if the intellect and Socrates
are united in the above manner, the action of the intellect cannot be attributed to Socrates. If, however,
Socrates be a whole composed of a union of the intellect with whatever else belongs to Socrates, and still
the intellect be united to those other things only as a motor, <strong>it follows that</strong> Socrates is not one absolutely,
and <strong>consequently</strong> neither a being absolutely, <strong>for</strong> a thing is a being according as it is one.

<p>	There remains, <strong>therefore</strong>, no other explanation than that given by Aristotle---namely, that this
particular man understands, <strong>because</strong> the intellectual principle is his form. <strong>Thus</strong> from the very operation of
the intellect it is made clear that the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form.

<p>	The same can be clearly shown from the nature of the human species. <strong>For</strong> the nature of each thing
is shown by its operation. Now the proper operation of man as man is to understand; <strong>because</strong> he thereby
surpasses all other animals. Whence <em>Aristotle</em> concludes (Ethic. x, 7) that the ultimate happiness of man
must consist in this operation as properly belonging to him. Man must <strong>therefore</strong> derive his species from
that which is the principle of this operation. But the species of anything is derived from its form. It follows
<strong>therefore</strong> that the intellectual principle is the proper form of man.

<p>	But we must observe that the nobler a form is, the more it rises above corporeal matter, the less it
is merged in matter, and the more it excels matter by its power and its operation; <strong>hence</strong> we find that the
form of a mixed body has another operation not caused by its elemental qualities. And the higher we
advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find that the power of the form excels the elementary matter;
as the vegetative soul excels the form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excels the vegetative soul. Now
the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms. <strong>Therefore</strong> it excels corporeal matter in its power by the
fact that it has an operation and a power in which corporeal matter has no share whatever. This power is
called the intellect.

<p>	It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soul is composed of matter and form, <strong>it would
follow</strong> that in no way could the soul be the form of the body. <strong>For</strong> <strong>since</strong> the form is an act, and matter is
only in potentiality, that which is composed of matter and form cannot itself be the form of another by
virtue of itself as a whole. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 2 &amp; 3: From this it is clear how to answer the Second and Third objections: <strong>since</strong>, in
order that man may be able to understand all things by means of his intellect, and that his intellect may
understand immaterial things and universals, it is sufficient that the intellectual power be not the act of the
body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 4: The human soul, by reason of its perfection, is not a form merged in matter, or
entirely embraced by matter. <strong>Therefore</strong> there is nothing to prevent some power thereof not being the act of
the body, although the soul is essentially the form of the body.

<p><strong>I.76.2: WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HUMAN BEINGS SHARE ONE INTELLECT?</strong>

<p><strong>[If Aquinas were to claim that humans share one intellect, then his philosophy would be analogous to
the belief that the soul is Brahman. </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, It is absolutely impossible <strong>for</strong> one intellect to belong to all men. This is clear if, as
<em>Plato</em> maintained, man is the intellect itself. <strong>For</strong> <strong>it would follow</strong> that Socrates and <em>Plato</em> are one man; and
that they are not distinct from each other, except by something outside the essence of each. The distinction
between <em>Socrates</em> and <em>Plato</em> would be no other than that of one man with a tunic and another with a cloak;
which is quite absurd.

<p>	It is likewise clear that this is impossible if, according to the opinion of <em>Aristotle</em> (De Anima ii, 2),
it is supposed that the intellect is a part or a power of the soul which is the form of man. <strong>For</strong> it is
impossible for many distinct individuals to have one form, as it is impossible for them to have one
existence, <strong>for</strong> the form is the principle of existence.

<p>	Again, this is clearly impossible, whatever one may hold as to the manner of the union of the
intellect to this or that man. <strong>For</strong> it is manifest that .... if there is one intellect, no matter how diverse may be
all those things of which the intellect makes use as instruments, in no way is it possible to say that <em>Socrates</em>
and <em>Plato</em> are otherwise than one understanding man. And if to this we add that to understand, which is the
act of the intellect, is not affected by any organ other than the intellect itself; it will further follow that there
is but one agent and one action: that is to say that all men are but one "understander," and have but one act
of understanding, in regard, that is, of one intelligible object. .... It follows, <strong>therefore</strong>, that it is altogether
impossible and unreasonable to maintain that there exists one intellect for all men.

<p><strong>I. 76.3: WHETHER BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN OTHER
SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 1: It would seem that besides the intellectual soul there are in man other souls essentially
different from one another, such as the sensitive soul and the nutritive soul. <strong>For</strong> corruptible and
incorruptible are not of the same substance. But the intellectual soul is incorruptible; whereas the other
souls, as the sensitive and the nutritive, are corruptible, as was shown above (Q75, A6). <strong>Therefore</strong> in man
the essence of the intellectual soul, the sensitive soul, and the nutritive soul, cannot be the same.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, <em>Plato</em> held that there were several souls in one body, distinct even as to organs, to
which souls he referred the different vital actions, saying that the nutritive power is in the liver, the
concupiscible in the heart, and the power of knowledge in the brain. Which opinion is rejected by <em>Aristotle</em>
(De Anima ii, 2), with regard to those parts of the soul which use corporeal organs; <strong>for this reason</strong>, that in
those animals which continue to live when they have been divided in each part are observed the operations
of the soul, as sense and appetite. Now this would not be the case if the various principles of the soul's
operations were essentially different, and distributed in the various parts of the body. But with regard to the
intellectual part, he seems to leave it in doubt whether it be "only logically" distinct from the other parts of
the soul, "or also locally."

<p>	The opinion of <em>Plato</em> might be maintained if, as he held, the soul was supposed to be united to the
body, not as its form, but as its motor. <strong>For</strong> it involves nothing unreasonable that the same movable thing be
moved by several motors; and still less if it be moved according to its various parts. If we suppose,
however, that the soul is united to the body as its form, it is quite impossible for several essentially different
souls to be in one body. This can be made clear by <em>three different reasons.</em>

<p>	In the <em>first</em> place, an animal would not be absolutely one, in which there were several souls. <strong>For</strong>
nothing is absolutely one except by one form, by which a thing has existence: <strong>because</strong> a thing has from the
same source both existence and unity; and <strong>therefore</strong> things which are denominated by various forms are
not absolutely one; as, <strong>for</strong> instance, "a white man." If, <strong>therefore</strong>, man were 'living' by one form, the
vegetative soul, and 'animal' by another form, the sensitive soul, and "man" by another form, the intellectual
soul, <strong>it would follow</strong> that man is not absolutely one. <strong>Thus</strong> <em>Aristotle</em> argues, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6),
against <em>Plato</em>, that if the idea of an animal is distinct from the idea of a biped, then a biped animal is not
absolutely one. <strong>For this reason</strong>, against those who hold that there are several souls in the body, he asks
(De Anima i, 5), "what contains them?"---that is, what makes them one? It cannot be said that they are
united by the one body; <strong>because</strong> rather does the soul contain the body and make it one, than the reverse.

<p>	<em>Secondly</em>, .... <em>Thirdly</em>, this is shown to be impossible by the fact that when one operation of the
soul is intense it impedes another, which could never be the case unless the principle of action were
essentially one.

<p>	We must <strong>therefore</strong> conclude that in man the sensitive soul, the intellectual soul, and the nutritive
soul are numerically one soul. This can easily be explained, if we consider the differences of species and
forms. <strong>For</strong> we observe that the species and forms of things differ from one another, as the perfect and
imperfect; as in the order of things, the animate are more perfect than the inanimate, and animals more
perfect than plants, and man than brute animals; and in each of these genera there are various degrees. ....

<p>	<strong>Thus</strong>, neither is <em>Socrates</em> a man by one soul, and animal by another; but by one and the same soul
he is both animal and man.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 1: The sensitive soul is incorruptible, not by reason of its being sensitive, but by reason
of its being intellectual. When, <strong>therefore</strong>, a soul is sensitive only, it is corruptible; but when with
sensibility it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible. <strong>For</strong> although sensibility does not give
incorruptibility, yet it cannot deprive intellectuality of its incorruptibility. [In other words, the intellectual
soul can do what purely sentient and purely vegetative souls can do without being limited to the functions
of these lower souls. Cf. I.76.4c ". . .there is no other <em>substantial form</em> in man besides the intellectual soul;
and that the soul, as it virtually contains the sensitive and nutritive souls, so does it virtually contain all
inferior forms, and itself alone does whatever the imperfect forms do in other things. The same is to be said
of the sensitive soul in brute animals, and of the nutritive soul in plants, and universally of all more perfect
forms with regard to the imperfect." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>ARTICLE COMMENTARY:</strong> If Aquinas is correct in arguing that every human being has only one soul,
then it is impossible for "humanoid animals" to exist (i.e. no human body can be kept alive without the
animating presence of the intellectual soul). Death thus occurs when the soul ceases to animate matter into
a living body. This means that when some one suffers "neocortical death" they are still alive even though
the brain's destruction precludes thought. It thus becomes matter of ethics to decide how to treat such
persons appropriately. See the following article for additional clarification.

<p><strong><strong>I.76.8: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IN EACH PART OF THE BODY?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, As we have said, if the soul were united to the body merely as its motor, we might
say that it is not in each part of the body, but only in one part through which it would move the others. But
<strong>since</strong> the soul is united to the body as its form, it must necessarily be in the whole body, and in each part
thereof. <strong>For</strong> it is not an <em>accidental form</em>, but the <em>substantial form</em> of the body. Now the <em>substantial form</em>
perfects not only the whole, but each part of the whole. <strong>For</strong> <strong>since</strong> a whole consists of parts, a form of the
whole which does not give existence to each of the parts of the body, is a form consisting in composition
and order, such as the form of a house; and such a form is accidental. But the soul is a <em>substantial form</em>;
and <strong>therefore</strong> it must be the form and the act, not only of the whole, but also of each part. <strong>Therefore</strong>, on
the withdrawal of the soul, as we do not speak of an animal or a man unless equivocally, as we speak of a
painted animal or a stone animal; so is it with the hand, the eye, the flesh and bones, as the Philosopher
says (De Anima ii, 1). A <strong>proof of which</strong> is, that <em>on the withdrawal of the soul, no part of the body retains
its proper action</em>; although that which retains its species, retains the action of the species. But act is in that
which it actuates: <em>therefore</em> the soul must be in the whole body, and in each part thereof.

<p><strong><strong>I.76.5: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS PROPERLY UNITED TO SUCH A
BODY?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, ... Now the intellectual soul, as we have seen above (Q55, A2) in the order of
nature, holds the lowest place among intellectual substances; inasmuch as it is not naturally gifted with the
knowledge of truth, as the angels are; but has to gather knowledge from individual things by way of the
senses, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii). But nature never fails in necessary things: <strong>therefore</strong> the
intellectual soul had to be endowed not only with the power of understanding, but also with the power of
feeling. Now the action of the senses is not performed without a corporeal instrument. <strong>Therefore</strong> it
behooved the intellectual soul to be united to a body fitted to be a convenient organ of sense.
