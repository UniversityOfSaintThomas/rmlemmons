<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter VI</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR><B>Beginning of the Peloponnesian War -</B> <B>First Invasion of 
<A NAME="12"></A>Attica - Funeral</B> <B>Oration of Pericles</B>
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>The war between the Athenians and Peloponnesians and the allies 
<A NAME="14"></A>on either side now really begins. For now all intercourse except through 
<A NAME="15"></A>the medium of heralds ceased, and hostilities were commenced and prosecuted 
<A NAME="16"></A>without intermission. The history follows the chronological order of events 
<A NAME="17"></A>by summers and winters.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>The thirty years' truce which was entered into after the conquest 
<A NAME="19"></A>of Euboea lasted fourteen years. In the fifteenth, in the forty-eighth 
<A NAME="20"></A>year of the priestess-ship of Chrysis at Argos, in the ephorate of Aenesias 
<A NAME="21"></A>at Sparta, in the last month but two of the archonship of Pythodorus at 
<A NAME="22"></A>Athens, and six months after the battle of Potidaea, just at the beginning 
<A NAME="23"></A>of spring, a Theban force a little over three hundred strong, under the 
<A NAME="24"></A>command of their Boeotarchs, Pythangelus, son of Phyleides, and Diemporus, 
<A NAME="25"></A>son of Onetorides, about the first watch of the night, made an armed entry 
<A NAME="26"></A>into Plataea, a town of Boeotia in alliance with Athens. The gates were 
<A NAME="27"></A>opened to them by a Plataean called Naucleides, who, with his party, had 
<A NAME="28"></A>invited them in, meaning to put to death the citizens of the opposite party, 
<A NAME="29"></A>bring over the city to Thebes, and thus obtain power for themselves. This 
<A NAME="30"></A>was arranged through Eurymachus, son of Leontiades, a person of great influence 
<A NAME="31"></A>at Thebes. For Plataea had always been at variance with Thebes; and the 
<A NAME="32"></A>latter, foreseeing that war was at hand, wished to surprise her old enemy 
<A NAME="33"></A>in time of peace, before hostilities had actually broken out. Indeed this 
<A NAME="34"></A>was how they got in so easily without being observed, as no guard had been 
<A NAME="35"></A>posted. After the soldiers had grounded arms in the market-place, those 
<A NAME="36"></A>who had invited them in wished them to set to work at once and go to their 
<A NAME="37"></A>enemies' houses. This, however, the Thebans refused to do, but determined 
<A NAME="38"></A>to make a conciliatory proclamation, and if possible to come to a friendly 
<A NAME="39"></A>understanding with the citizens. Their herald accordingly invited any who 
<A NAME="40"></A>wished to resume their old place in the confederacy of their countrymen 
<A NAME="41"></A>to ground arms with them, for they thought that in this way the city would 
<A NAME="42"></A>readily join them.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>On becoming aware of the presence of the Thebans within their gates, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and of the sudden occupation of the town, the Plataeans concluded in their 
<A NAME="45"></A>alarm that more had entered than was really the case, the night preventing 
<A NAME="46"></A>their seeing them. They accordingly came to terms and, accepting the proposal, 
<A NAME="47"></A>made no movement; especially as the Thebans offered none of them any violence. 
<A NAME="48"></A>But somehow or other, during the negotiations, they discovered the scanty 
<A NAME="49"></A>numbers of the Thebans, and decided that they could easily attack and overpower 
<A NAME="50"></A>them; the mass of the Plataeans being averse to revolting from Athens. 
<A NAME="51"></A>At all events they resolved to attempt it. Digging through the party walls 
<A NAME="52"></A>of the houses, they thus managed to join each other without being seen 
<A NAME="53"></A>going through the streets, in which they placed wagons without the beasts 
<A NAME="54"></A>in them, to serve as a barricade, and arranged everything else as seemed 
<A NAME="55"></A>convenient for the occasion. When everything had been done that circumstances 
<A NAME="56"></A>permitted, they watched their opportunity and went out of their houses 
<A NAME="57"></A>against the enemy. It was still night, though daybreak was at hand: in 
<A NAME="58"></A>daylight it was thought that their attack would be met by men full of courage 
<A NAME="59"></A>and on equal terms with their assailants, while in darkness it would fall 
<A NAME="60"></A>upon panic-stricken troops, who would also be at a disadvantage from their 
<A NAME="61"></A>enemy's knowledge of the locality. So they made their assault at once, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and came to close quarters as quickly as they could.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>The Thebans, finding themselves outwitted, immediately closed up 
<A NAME="64"></A>to repel all attacks made upon them. Twice or thrice they beat back their 
<A NAME="65"></A>assailants. But the men shouted and charged them, the women and slaves 
<A NAME="66"></A>screamed and yelled from the houses and pelted them with stones and tiles; 
<A NAME="67"></A>besides, it had been raining hard all night; and so at last their courage 
<A NAME="68"></A>gave way, and they turned and fled through the town. Most of the fugitives 
<A NAME="69"></A>were quite ignorant of the right ways out, and this, with the mud, and 
<A NAME="70"></A>the darkness caused by the moon being in her last quarter, and the fact 
<A NAME="71"></A>that their pursuers knew their way about and could easily stop their escape, 
<A NAME="72"></A>proved fatal to many. The only gate open was the one by which they had 
<A NAME="73"></A>entered, and this was shut by one of the Plataeans driving the spike of 
<A NAME="74"></A>a javelin into the bar instead of the bolt; so that even here there was 
<A NAME="75"></A>no longer any means of exit. They were now chased all over the town. Some 
<A NAME="76"></A>got on the wall and threw themselves over, in most cases with a fatal result. 
<A NAME="77"></A>One party managed to find a deserted gate, and obtaining an axe from a 
<A NAME="78"></A>woman, cut through the bar; but as they were soon observed only a few succeeded 
<A NAME="79"></A>in getting out. Others were cut off in detail in different parts of the 
<A NAME="80"></A>city. The most numerous and compact body rushed into a large building next 
<A NAME="81"></A>to the city wall: the doors on the side of the street happened to be open, 
<A NAME="82"></A>and the Thebans fancied that they were the gates of the town, and that 
<A NAME="83"></A>there was a passage right through to the outside. The Plataeans, seeing 
<A NAME="84"></A>their enemies in a trap, now consulted whether they should set fire to 
<A NAME="85"></A>the building and burn them just as they were, or whether there was anything 
<A NAME="86"></A>else that they could do with them; until at length these and the rest of 
<A NAME="87"></A>the Theban survivors found wandering about the town agreed to an unconditional 
<A NAME="88"></A>surrender of themselves and their arms to the Plataeans.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>While such was the fate of the party in Plataea, the rest of the 
<A NAME="90"></A>Thebans who were to have joined them with all their forces before daybreak, 
<A NAME="91"></A>in case of anything miscarrying with the body that had entered, received 
<A NAME="92"></A>the news of the affair on the road, and pressed forward to their succour. 
<A NAME="93"></A>Now Plataea is nearly eight miles from Thebes, and their march delayed 
<A NAME="94"></A>by the rain that had fallen in the night, for the river Asopus had risen 
<A NAME="95"></A>and was not easy of passage; and so, having to march in the rain, and being 
<A NAME="96"></A>hindered in crossing the river, they arrived too late, and found the whole 
<A NAME="97"></A>party either slain or captive. When they learned what had happened, they 
<A NAME="98"></A>at once formed a design against the Plataeans outside the city. As the 
<A NAME="99"></A>attack had been made in time of peace, and was perfectly unexpected, there 
<A NAME="100"></A>were of course men and stock in the fields; and the Thebans wished if possible 
<A NAME="101"></A>to have some prisoners to exchange against their countrymen in the town, 
<A NAME="102"></A>should any chance to have been taken alive. Such was their plan. But the 
<A NAME="103"></A>Plataeans suspected their intention almost before it was formed, and becoming 
<A NAME="104"></A>alarmed for their fellow citizens outside the town, sent a herald to the 
<A NAME="105"></A>Thebans, reproaching them for their unscrupulous attempt to seize their 
<A NAME="106"></A>city in time of peace, and warning them against any outrage on those outside. 
<A NAME="107"></A>Should the warning be disregarded, they threatened to put to death the 
<A NAME="108"></A>men they had in their hands, but added that, on the Thebans retiring from 
<A NAME="109"></A>their territory, they would surrender the prisoners to their friends. This 
<A NAME="110"></A>is the Theban account of the matter, and they say that they had an oath 
<A NAME="111"></A>given them. The Plataeans, on the other hand, do not admit any promise 
<A NAME="112"></A>of an immediate surrender, but make it contingent upon subsequent negotiation: 
<A NAME="113"></A>the oath they deny altogether. Be this as it may, upon the Thebans retiring 
<A NAME="114"></A>from their territory without committing any injury, the Plataeans hastily 
<A NAME="115"></A>got in whatever they had in the country and immediately put the men to 
<A NAME="116"></A>death. The prisoners were a hundred and eighty in number; Eurymachus, the 
<A NAME="117"></A>person with whom the traitors had negotiated, being 
<A NAME="118"></A>one.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>This done, the Plataeans sent a messenger to Athens, gave back 
<A NAME="120"></A>the dead to the Thebans under a truce, and arranged things in the city 
<A NAME="121"></A>as seemed best to meet the present emergency. The Athenians meanwhile, 
<A NAME="122"></A>having had word of the affair sent them immediately after its occurrence, 
<A NAME="123"></A>had instantly seized all the Boeotians in Attica, and sent a herald to 
<A NAME="124"></A>the Plataeans to forbid their proceeding to extremities with their Theban 
<A NAME="125"></A>prisoners without instructions from Athens. The news of the men's death 
<A NAME="126"></A>had of course not arrived; the first messenger having left Plataea just 
<A NAME="127"></A>when the Thebans entered it, the second just after their defeat and capture; 
<A NAME="128"></A>so there was no later news. Thus the Athenians sent orders in ignorance 
<A NAME="129"></A>of the facts; and the herald on his arrival found the men slain. After 
<A NAME="130"></A>this the Athenians marched to Plataea and brought in provisions, and left 
<A NAME="131"></A>a garrison in the place, also taking away the women and children and such 
<A NAME="132"></A>of the men as were least efficient.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>After the affair at Plataea, the treaty had been broken by an overt 
<A NAME="134"></A>act, and Athens at once prepared for war, as did also Lacedaemon and her 
<A NAME="135"></A>allies. They resolved to send embassies to the King and to such other of 
<A NAME="136"></A>the barbarian powers as either party could look to for assistance, and 
<A NAME="137"></A>tried to ally themselves with the independent states at home. Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="138"></A>in addition to the existing marine, gave orders to the states that had 
<A NAME="139"></A>declared for her in Italy and Sicily to build vessels up to a grand total 
<A NAME="140"></A>of five hundred, the quota of each city being determined by its size, and 
<A NAME="141"></A>also to provide a specified sum of money. Till these were ready they were 
<A NAME="142"></A>to remain neutral and to admit single Athenian ships into their harbours. 
<A NAME="143"></A>Athens on her part reviewed her existing confederacy, and sent embassies 
<A NAME="144"></A>to the places more immediately round Peloponnese- Corcyra, Cephallenia, 
<A NAME="145"></A>Acarnania, and Zacynthus- perceiving that if these could be relied on she 
<A NAME="146"></A>could carry the war all round Peloponnese.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>And if both sides nourished the boldest hopes and put forth their 
<A NAME="148"></A>utmost strength for the war, this was only natural. Zeal is always at its 
<A NAME="149"></A>height at the commencement of an undertaking; and on this particular occasion 
<A NAME="150"></A>Peloponnese and Athens were both full of young men whose inexperience made 
<A NAME="151"></A>them eager to take up arms, while the rest of Hellas stood straining with 
<A NAME="152"></A>excitement at the conflict of its leading cities. Everywhere predictions 
<A NAME="153"></A>were being recited and oracles being chanted by such persons as collect 
<A NAME="154"></A>them, and this not only in the contending cities. Further, some while before 
<A NAME="155"></A>this, there was an earthquake at Delos, for the first time in the memory 
<A NAME="156"></A>of the Hellenes. This was said and thought to be ominous of the events 
<A NAME="157"></A>impending; indeed, nothing of the kind that happened was allowed to pass 
<A NAME="158"></A>without remark. The good wishes of men made greatly for the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="159"></A>especially as they proclaimed themselves the liberators of Hellas. No private 
<A NAME="160"></A>or public effort that could help them in speech or action was omitted; 
<A NAME="161"></A>each thinking that the cause suffered wherever he could not himself see 
<A NAME="162"></A>to it. So general was the indignation felt against Athens, whether by those 
<A NAME="163"></A>who wished to escape from her empire, or were apprehensive of being absorbed 
<A NAME="164"></A>by it. Such were the preparations and such the feelings with which the 
<A NAME="165"></A>contest opened.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>The allies of the two belligerents were the following. These were 
<A NAME="167"></A>the allies of Lacedaemon: all the Peloponnesians within the Isthmus except 
<A NAME="168"></A>the Argives and Achaeans, who were neutral; Pellene being the only Achaean 
<A NAME="169"></A>city that first joined in the war, though her example was afterwards followed 
<A NAME="170"></A>by the rest. Outside Peloponnese the Megarians, Locrians, Boeotians, Phocians, 
<A NAME="171"></A>Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians. Of these, ships were furnished 
<A NAME="172"></A>by the Corinthians, Megarians, Sicyonians, Pellenians, Eleans, Ambraciots, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and Leucadians; and cavalry by the Boeotians, Phocians, and Locrians. The 
<A NAME="174"></A>other states sent infantry. This was the Lacedaemonian confederacy. That 
<A NAME="175"></A>of Athens comprised the Chians, Lesbians, Plataeans, the Messenians in 
<A NAME="176"></A>Naupactus, most of the Acarnanians, the Corcyraeans, Zacynthians, and some 
<A NAME="177"></A>tributary cities in the following countries, viz., Caria upon the sea with 
<A NAME="178"></A>her Dorian neighbours, Ionia, the Hellespont, the Thracian towns, the islands 
<A NAME="179"></A>lying between Peloponnese and Crete towards the east, and all the Cyclades 
<A NAME="180"></A>except Melos and Thera. Of these, ships were furnished by Chios, Lesbos, 
<A NAME="181"></A>and Corcyra, infantry and money by the rest. Such were the allies of either 
<A NAME="182"></A>party and their resources for the war.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Immediately after the affair at Plataea, Lacedaemon sent round 
<A NAME="184"></A>orders to the cities in Peloponnese and the rest of her confederacy to 
<A NAME="185"></A>prepare troops and the provisions requisite for a foreign campaign, in 
<A NAME="186"></A>order to invade Attica. The several states were ready at the time appointed 
<A NAME="187"></A>and assembled at the Isthmus: the contingent of each city being two-thirds 
<A NAME="188"></A>of its whole force. After the whole army had mustered, the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="189"></A>king, Archidamus, the leader of the expedition, called together the generals 
<A NAME="190"></A>of all the states and the principal persons and officers, and exhorted 
<A NAME="191"></A>them as follows:
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>"Peloponnesians and allies, our fathers made many campaigns both 
<A NAME="193"></A>within and without Peloponnese, and the elder men among us here are not 
<A NAME="194"></A>without experience in war. Yet we have never set out with a larger force 
<A NAME="195"></A>than the present; and if our numbers and efficiency are remarkable, so 
<A NAME="196"></A>also is the power of the state against which we march. We ought not then 
<A NAME="197"></A>to show ourselves inferior to our ancestors, or unequal to our own reputation. 
<A NAME="198"></A>For the hopes and attention of all Hellas are bent upon the present effort, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and its sympathy is with the enemy of the hated Athens. Therefore, numerous 
<A NAME="200"></A>as the invading army may appear to be, and certain as some may think it 
<A NAME="201"></A>that our adversary will not meet us in the field, this is no sort of justification 
<A NAME="202"></A>for the least negligence upon the march; but the officers and men of each 
<A NAME="203"></A>particular city should always be prepared for the advent of danger in their 
<A NAME="204"></A>own quarters. The course of war cannot be foreseen, and its attacks are 
<A NAME="205"></A>generally dictated by the impulse of the moment; and where overweening 
<A NAME="206"></A>self-confidence has despised preparation, a wise apprehension often been 
<A NAME="207"></A>able to make head against superior numbers. Not that confidence is out 
<A NAME="208"></A>of place in an army of invasion, but in an enemy's country it should also 
<A NAME="209"></A>be accompanied by the precautions of apprehension: troops will by this 
<A NAME="210"></A>combination be best inspired for dealing a blow, and best secured against 
<A NAME="211"></A>receiving one. In the present instance, the city against which we are going, 
<A NAME="212"></A>far from being so impotent for defence, is on the contrary most excellently 
<A NAME="213"></A>equipped at all points; so that we have every reason to expect that they 
<A NAME="214"></A>will take the field against us, and that if they have not set out already 
<A NAME="215"></A>before we are there, they will certainly do so when they see us in their 
<A NAME="216"></A>territory wasting and destroying their property. For men are always exasperated 
<A NAME="217"></A>at suffering injuries to which they are not accustomed, and on seeing them 
<A NAME="218"></A>inflicted before their very eyes; and where least inclined for reflection, 
<A NAME="219"></A>rush with the greatest heat to action. The Athenians are the very people 
<A NAME="220"></A>of all others to do this, as they aspire to rule the rest of the world, 
<A NAME="221"></A>and are more in the habit of invading and ravaging their neighbours' territory, 
<A NAME="222"></A>than of seeing their own treated in the like fashion. Considering, therefore, 
<A NAME="223"></A>the power of the state against which we are marching, and the greatness 
<A NAME="224"></A>of the reputation which, according to the event, we shall win or lose for 
<A NAME="225"></A>our ancestors and ourselves, remember as you follow where you may be led 
<A NAME="226"></A>to regard discipline and vigilance as of the first importance, and to obey 
<A NAME="227"></A>with alacrity the orders transmitted to you; as nothing contributes so 
<A NAME="228"></A>much to the credit and safety of an army as the union of large bodies by 
<A NAME="229"></A>a single discipline."
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>With this brief speech dismissing the assembly, Archidamus first 
<A NAME="231"></A>sent off Melesippus, son of Diacritus, a Spartan, to Athens, in case she 
<A NAME="232"></A>should be more inclined to submit on seeing the Peloponnesians actually 
<A NAME="233"></A>on the march. But the Athenians did not admit into the city or to their 
<A NAME="234"></A>assembly, Pericles having already carried a motion against admitting either 
<A NAME="235"></A>herald or embassy from the Lacedaemonians after they had once marched 
<A NAME="236"></A>out.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>The herald was accordingly sent away without an audience, and ordered 
<A NAME="238"></A>to be beyond the frontier that same day; in future, if those who sent him 
<A NAME="239"></A>had a proposition to make, they must retire to their own territory before 
<A NAME="240"></A>they dispatched embassies to Athens. An escort was sent with Melesippus 
<A NAME="241"></A>to prevent his holding communication with any one. When he reached the 
<A NAME="242"></A>frontier and was just going to be dismissed, he departed with these words: 
<A NAME="243"></A>"This day will be the beginning of great misfortunes to the Hellenes." 
<A NAME="244"></A>As soon as he arrived at the camp, and Archidamus learnt that the Athenians 
<A NAME="245"></A>had still no thoughts of submitting, he at length began his march, and 
<A NAME="246"></A>advanced with his army into their territory. Meanwhile the Boeotians, sending 
<A NAME="247"></A>their contingent and cavalry to join the Peloponnesian expedition, went 
<A NAME="248"></A>to Plataea with the remainder and laid waste the country.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>While the Peloponnesians were still mustering at the Isthmus, or 
<A NAME="250"></A>on the march before they invaded Attica, Pericles, son of Xanthippus, one 
<A NAME="251"></A>of the ten generals of the Athenians, finding that the invasion was to 
<A NAME="252"></A>take place, conceived the idea that Archidamus, who happened to be his 
<A NAME="253"></A>friend, might possibly pass by his estate without ravaging it. This he 
<A NAME="254"></A>might do, either from a personal wish to oblige him, or acting under instructions 
<A NAME="255"></A>from Lacedaemon for the purpose of creating a prejudice against him, as 
<A NAME="256"></A>had been before attempted in the demand for the expulsion of the accursed 
<A NAME="257"></A>family. He accordingly took the precaution of announcing to the Athenians 
<A NAME="258"></A>in the assembly that, although Archidamus was his friend, yet this friendship 
<A NAME="259"></A>should not extend to the detriment of the state, and that in case the enemy 
<A NAME="260"></A>should make his houses and lands an exception to the rest and not pillage 
<A NAME="261"></A>them, he at once gave them up to be public property, so that they should 
<A NAME="262"></A>not bring him into suspicion. He also gave the citizens some advice on 
<A NAME="263"></A>their present affairs in the same strain as before. They were to prepare 
<A NAME="264"></A>for the war, and to carry in their property from the country. They were 
<A NAME="265"></A>not to go out to battle, but to come into the city and guard it, and get 
<A NAME="266"></A>ready their fleet, in which their real strength lay. They were also to 
<A NAME="267"></A>keep a tight rein on their allies- the strength of Athens being derived 
<A NAME="268"></A>from the money brought in by their payments, and success in war depending 
<A NAME="269"></A>principally upon conduct and capital. had no reason to despond. Apart from 
<A NAME="270"></A>other sources of income, an average revenue of six hundred talents of silver 
<A NAME="271"></A>was drawn from the tribute of the allies; and there were still six thousand 
<A NAME="272"></A>talents of coined silver in the Acropolis, out of nine thousand seven hundred 
<A NAME="273"></A>that had once been there, from which the money had been taken for the porch 
<A NAME="274"></A>of the Acropolis, the other public buildings, and for Potidaea. This did 
<A NAME="275"></A>not include the uncoined gold and silver in public and private offerings, 
<A NAME="276"></A>the sacred vessels for the processions and games, the Median spoils, and 
<A NAME="277"></A>similar resources to the amount of five hundred talents. To this he added 
<A NAME="278"></A>the treasures of the other temples. These were by no means inconsiderable, 
<A NAME="279"></A>and might fairly be used. Nay, if they were ever absolutely driven to it, 
<A NAME="280"></A>they might take even the gold ornaments of Athene herself; for the statue 
<A NAME="281"></A>contained forty talents of pure gold and it was all removable. This might 
<A NAME="282"></A>be used for self-preservation, and must every penny of it be restored. 
<A NAME="283"></A>Such was their financial position- surely a satisfactory one. Then they 
<A NAME="284"></A>had an army of thirteen thousand heavy infantry, besides sixteen thousand 
<A NAME="285"></A>more in the garrisons and on home duty at Athens. This was at first the 
<A NAME="286"></A>number of men on guard in the event of an invasion: it was composed of 
<A NAME="287"></A>the oldest and youngest levies and the resident aliens who had heavy armour. 
<A NAME="288"></A>The Phaleric wall ran for four miles, before it joined that round the city; 
<A NAME="289"></A>and of this last nearly five had a guard, although part of it was left 
<A NAME="290"></A>without one, viz., that between the Long Wall and the Phaleric. Then there 
<A NAME="291"></A>were the Long Walls to Piraeus, a distance of some four miles and a half, 
<A NAME="292"></A>the outer of which was manned. Lastly, the circumference of Piraeus with 
<A NAME="293"></A>Munychia was nearly seven miles and a half; only half of this, however, 
<A NAME="294"></A>was guarded. Pericles also showed them that they had twelve hundred horse 
<A NAME="295"></A>including mounted archers, with sixteen hundred archers unmounted, and 
<A NAME="296"></A>three hundred galleys fit for service. Such were the resources of Athens 
<A NAME="297"></A>in the different departments when the Peloponnesian invasion was impending 
<A NAME="298"></A>and hostilities were being commenced. Pericles also urged his usual arguments 
<A NAME="299"></A>for expecting a favourable issue to the war.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians listened to his advice, and began to carry in their 
<A NAME="301"></A>wives and children from the country, and all their household furniture, 
<A NAME="302"></A>even to the woodwork of their houses which they took down. Their sheep 
<A NAME="303"></A>and cattle they sent over to Euboea and the adjacent islands. But they 
<A NAME="304"></A>found it hard to move, as most of them had been always used to live in 
<A NAME="305"></A>the country.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>From very early times this had been more the case with the Athenians 
<A NAME="307"></A>than with others. Under Cecrops and the first kings, down to the reign 
<A NAME="308"></A>of Theseus, Attica had always consisted of a number of independent townships, 
<A NAME="309"></A>each with its own town hall and magistrates. Except in times of danger 
<A NAME="310"></A>the king at Athens was not consulted; in ordinary seasons they carried 
<A NAME="311"></A>on their government and settled their affairs without his interference; 
<A NAME="312"></A>sometimes even they waged war against him, as in the case of the Eleusinians 
<A NAME="313"></A>with Eumolpus against Erechtheus. In Theseus, however, they had a king 
<A NAME="314"></A>of equal intelligence and power; and one of the chief features in his organization 
<A NAME="315"></A>of the country was to abolish the council-chambers and magistrates of the 
<A NAME="316"></A>petty cities, and to merge them in the single council-chamber and town 
<A NAME="317"></A>hall of the present capital. Individuals might still enjoy their private 
<A NAME="318"></A>property just as before, but they were henceforth compelled to have only 
<A NAME="319"></A>one political centre, viz., Athens; which thus counted all the inhabitants 
<A NAME="320"></A>of Attica among her citizens, so that when Theseus died he left a great 
<A NAME="321"></A>state behind him. Indeed, from him dates the Synoecia, or Feast of Union; 
<A NAME="322"></A>which is paid for by the state, and which the Athenians still keep in honour 
<A NAME="323"></A>of the goddess. Before this the city consisted of the present citadel and 
<A NAME="324"></A>the district beneath it looking rather towards the south. This is shown 
<A NAME="325"></A>by the fact that the temples of the other deities, besides that of Athene, 
<A NAME="326"></A>are in the citadel; and even those that are outside it are mostly situated 
<A NAME="327"></A>in this quarter of the city, as that of the Olympian Zeus, of the Pythian 
<A NAME="328"></A>Apollo, of Earth, and of Dionysus in the Marshes, the same in whose honour 
<A NAME="329"></A>the older Dionysia are to this day celebrated in the month of Anthesterion 
<A NAME="330"></A>not only by the Athenians but also by their Ionian descendants. There are 
<A NAME="331"></A>also other ancient temples in this quarter. The fountain too, which, since 
<A NAME="332"></A>the alteration made by the tyrants, has been called Enneacrounos, or Nine 
<A NAME="333"></A>Pipes, but which, when the spring was open, went by the name of Callirhoe, 
<A NAME="334"></A>or Fairwater, was in those days, from being so near, used for the most 
<A NAME="335"></A>important offices. Indeed, the old fashion of using the water before marriage 
<A NAME="336"></A>and for other sacred purposes is still kept up. Again, from their old residence 
<A NAME="337"></A>in that quarter, the citadel is still known among Athenians as the 
<A NAME="338"></A>city.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians thus long lived scattered over Attica in independent 
<A NAME="340"></A>townships. Even after the centralization of Theseus, old habit still prevailed; 
<A NAME="341"></A>and from the early times down to the present war most Athenians still lived 
<A NAME="342"></A>in the country with their families and households, and were consequently 
<A NAME="343"></A>not at all inclined to move now, especially as they had only just restored 
<A NAME="344"></A>their establishments after the Median invasion. Deep was their trouble 
<A NAME="345"></A>and discontent at abandoning their houses and the hereditary temples of 
<A NAME="346"></A>the ancient constitution, and at having to change their habits of life 
<A NAME="347"></A>and to bid farewell to what each regarded as his native 
<A NAME="348"></A>city.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>When they arrived at Athens, though a few had houses of their own 
<A NAME="350"></A>to go to, or could find an asylum with friends or relatives, by far the 
<A NAME="351"></A>greater number had to take up their dwelling in the parts of the city that 
<A NAME="352"></A>were not built over and in the temples and chapels of the heroes, except 
<A NAME="353"></A>the Acropolis and the temple of the Eleusinian Demeter and such other Places 
<A NAME="354"></A>as were always kept closed. The occupation of the plot of ground lying 
<A NAME="355"></A>below the citadel called the Pelasgian had been forbidden by a curse; and 
<A NAME="356"></A>there was also an ominous fragment of a Pythian oracle which 
<A NAME="357"></A>said:
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Leave the Pelasgian parcel desolate,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Woe worth the day that men inhabit it! Yet this too was now built over 
<A NAME="360"></A>in the necessity of the moment. And in my opinion, if the oracle proved 
<A NAME="361"></A>true, it was in the opposite sense to what was expected. For the misfortunes 
<A NAME="362"></A>of the state did not arise from the unlawful occupation, but the necessity 
<A NAME="363"></A>of the occupation from the war; and though the god did not mention this, 
<A NAME="364"></A>he foresaw that it would be an evil day for Athens in which the plot came 
<A NAME="365"></A>to be inhabited. Many also took up their quarters in the towers of the 
<A NAME="366"></A>walls or wherever else they could. For when they were all come in, the 
<A NAME="367"></A>city proved too small to hold them; though afterwards they divided the 
<A NAME="368"></A>Long Walls and a great part of Piraeus into lots and settled there. All 
<A NAME="369"></A>this while great attention was being given to the war; the allies were 
<A NAME="370"></A>being mustered, and an armament of a hundred ships equipped for Peloponnese. 
<A NAME="371"></A>Such was the state of preparation at Athens.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the army of the Peloponnesians was advancing. The first 
<A NAME="373"></A>town they came to in Attica was Oenoe, where they to enter the country. 
<A NAME="374"></A>Sitting down before it, they prepared to assault the wall with engines 
<A NAME="375"></A>and otherwise. Oenoe, standing upon the Athenian and Boeotian border, was 
<A NAME="376"></A>of course a walled town, and was used as a fortress by the Athenians in 
<A NAME="377"></A>time of war. So the Peloponnesians prepared for their assault, and wasted 
<A NAME="378"></A>some valuable time before the place. This delay brought the gravest censure 
<A NAME="379"></A>upon Archidamus. Even during the levying of the war he had credit for weakness 
<A NAME="380"></A>and Athenian sympathies by the half measures he had advocated; and after 
<A NAME="381"></A>the army had assembled he had further injured himself in public estimation 
<A NAME="382"></A>by his loitering at the Isthmus and the slowness with which the rest of 
<A NAME="383"></A>the march had been conducted. But all this was as nothing to the delay 
<A NAME="384"></A>at Oenoe. During this interval the Athenians were carrying in their property; 
<A NAME="385"></A>and it was the belief of the Peloponnesians that a quick advance would 
<A NAME="386"></A>have found everything still out, had it not been for his procrastination. 
<A NAME="387"></A>Such was the feeling of the army towards Archidamus during the siege. But 
<A NAME="388"></A>he, it is said, expected that the Athenians would shrink from letting their 
<A NAME="389"></A>land be wasted, and would make their submission while it was still uninjured; 
<A NAME="390"></A>and this was why he waited.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>But after he had assaulted Oenoe, and every possible attempt to 
<A NAME="392"></A>take it had failed, as no herald came from Athens, he at last broke up 
<A NAME="393"></A>his camp and invaded Attica. This was about eighty days after the Theban 
<A NAME="394"></A>attempt upon Plataea, just in the middle of summer, when the corn was ripe, 
<A NAME="395"></A>and Archidamus, son of Zeuxis, king of Lacedaemon, was in command. Encamping 
<A NAME="396"></A>in Eleusis and the Thriasian plain, they began their ravages, and putting 
<A NAME="397"></A>to flight some Athenian horse at a place called Rheiti, or the Brooks, 
<A NAME="398"></A>they then advanced, keeping Mount Aegaleus on their right, through Cropia, 
<A NAME="399"></A>until they reached Acharnae, the largest of the Athenian demes or townships. 
<A NAME="400"></A>Sitting down before it, they formed a camp there, and continued their ravages 
<A NAME="401"></A>for a long while.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>The reason why Archidamus remained in order of battle at Acharnae 
<A NAME="403"></A>during this incursion, instead of descending into the plain, is said to 
<A NAME="404"></A>have been this. He hoped that the Athenians might possibly be tempted by 
<A NAME="405"></A>the multitude of their youth and the unprecedented efficiency of their 
<A NAME="406"></A>service to come out to battle and attempt to stop the devastation of their 
<A NAME="407"></A>lands. Accordingly, as they had met him at Eleusis or the Thriasian plain, 
<A NAME="408"></A>he tried if they could be provoked to a sally by the spectacle of a camp 
<A NAME="409"></A>at Acharnae. He thought the place itself a good position for encamping; 
<A NAME="410"></A>and it seemed likely that such an important part of the state as the three 
<A NAME="411"></A>thousand heavy infantry of the Acharnians would refuse to submit to the 
<A NAME="412"></A>ruin of their property, and would force a battle on the rest of the citizens. 
<A NAME="413"></A>On the other hand, should the Athenians not take the field during this 
<A NAME="414"></A>incursion, he could then fearlessly ravage the plain in future invasions, 
<A NAME="415"></A>and extend his advance up to the very walls of Athens. After the Acharnians 
<A NAME="416"></A>had lost their own property they would be less willing to risk themselves 
<A NAME="417"></A>for that of their neighbours; and so there would be division in the Athenian 
<A NAME="418"></A>counsels. These were the motives of Archidamus for remaining at 
<A NAME="419"></A>Acharnae.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>In the meanwhile, as long as the army was at Eleusis and the Thriasian 
<A NAME="421"></A>plain, hopes were still entertained of its not advancing any nearer. It 
<A NAME="422"></A>was remembered that Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="423"></A>had invaded Attica with a Peloponnesian army fourteen years before, but 
<A NAME="424"></A>had retreated without advancing farther than Eleusis and Thria, which indeed 
<A NAME="425"></A>proved the cause of his exile from Sparta, as it was thought he had been 
<A NAME="426"></A>bribed to retreat. But when they saw the army at Acharnae, barely seven 
<A NAME="427"></A>miles from Athens, they lost all patience. The territory of Athens was 
<A NAME="428"></A>being ravaged before the very eyes of the Athenians, a sight which the 
<A NAME="429"></A>young men had never seen before and the old only in the Median wars; and 
<A NAME="430"></A>it was naturally thought a grievous insult, and the determination was universal, 
<A NAME="431"></A>especially among the young men, to sally forth and stop it. Knots were 
<A NAME="432"></A>formed in the streets and engaged in hot discussion; for if the proposed 
<A NAME="433"></A>sally was warmly recommended, it was also in some cases opposed. Oracles 
<A NAME="434"></A>of the most various import were recited by the collectors, and found eager 
<A NAME="435"></A>listeners in one or other of the disputants. Foremost in pressing for the 
<A NAME="436"></A>sally were the Acharnians, as constituting no small part of the army of 
<A NAME="437"></A>the state, and as it was their land that was being ravaged. In short, the 
<A NAME="438"></A>whole city was in a most excited state; Pericles was the object of general 
<A NAME="439"></A>indignation; his previous counsels were totally forgotten; he was abused 
<A NAME="440"></A>for not leading out the army which he commanded, and was made responsible 
<A NAME="441"></A>for the whole of the public suffering.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>He, meanwhile, seeing anger and infatuation just now in the ascendant, 
<A NAME="443"></A>and of his wisdom in refusing a sally, would not call either assembly or 
<A NAME="444"></A>meeting of the people, fearing the fatal results of a debate inspired by 
<A NAME="445"></A>passion and not by prudence. Accordingly he addressed himself to the defence 
<A NAME="446"></A>of the city, and kept it as quiet as possible, though he constantly sent 
<A NAME="447"></A>out cavalry to prevent raids on the lands near the city from flying parties 
<A NAME="448"></A>of the enemy. There was a trifling affair at Phrygia between a squadron 
<A NAME="449"></A>of the Athenian horse with the Thessalians and the Boeotian cavalry; in 
<A NAME="450"></A>which the former had rather the best of it, until the heavy infantry advanced 
<A NAME="451"></A>to the support of the Boeotians, when the Thessalians and Athenians were 
<A NAME="452"></A>routed and lost a few men, whose bodies, however, were recovered the same 
<A NAME="453"></A>day without a truce. The next day the Peloponnesians set up a trophy. Ancient 
<A NAME="454"></A>alliance brought the Thessalians to the aid of Athens; those who came being 
<A NAME="455"></A>the Larisaeans, Pharsalians, Cranonians, Pyrasians, Gyrtonians, and Pheraeans. 
<A NAME="456"></A>The Larisaean commanders were Polymedes and Aristonus, two party leaders 
<A NAME="457"></A>in Larisa; the Pharsalian general was Menon; each of the other cities had 
<A NAME="458"></A>also its own commander.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the Peloponnesians, as the Athenians did not come 
<A NAME="460"></A>out to engage them, broke up from Acharnae and ravaged some of the demes 
<A NAME="461"></A>between Mount Parnes and Brilessus. While they were in Attica the Athenians 
<A NAME="462"></A>sent off the hundred ships which they had been preparing round Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="463"></A>with a thousand heavy infantry and four hundred archers on board, under 
<A NAME="464"></A>the command of Carcinus, son of Xenotimus, Proteas, son of Epicles, and 
<A NAME="465"></A>Socrates, son of Antigenes. This armament weighed anchor and started on 
<A NAME="466"></A>its cruise, and the Peloponnesians, after remaining in Attica as long as 
<A NAME="467"></A>their provisions lasted, retired through Boeotia by a different road to 
<A NAME="468"></A>that by which they had entered. As they passed Oropus they ravaged the 
<A NAME="469"></A>territory of Graea, which is held by the Oropians from Athens, and reaching 
<A NAME="470"></A>Peloponnese broke up to their respective cities.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>After they had retired the Athenians set guards by land and sea 
<A NAME="472"></A>at the points at which they intended to have regular stations during the 
<A NAME="473"></A>war. They also resolved to set apart a special fund of a thousand talents 
<A NAME="474"></A>from the moneys in the Acropolis. This was not to be spent, but the current 
<A NAME="475"></A>expenses of the war were to be otherwise provided for. If any one should 
<A NAME="476"></A>move or put to the vote a proposition for using the money for any purpose 
<A NAME="477"></A>whatever except that of defending the city in the event of the enemy bringing 
<A NAME="478"></A>a fleet to make an attack by sea, it should be a capital offence. With 
<A NAME="479"></A>this sum of money they also set aside a special fleet of one hundred galleys, 
<A NAME="480"></A>the best ships of each year, with their captains. None of these were to 
<A NAME="481"></A>be used except with the money and against the same peril, should such peril 
<A NAME="482"></A>arise.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Athenians in the hundred ships round Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="484"></A>reinforced by a Corcyraean squadron of fifty vessels and some others of 
<A NAME="485"></A>the allies in those parts, cruised about the coasts and ravaged the country. 
<A NAME="486"></A>Among other places they landed in Laconia and made an assault upon Methone; 
<A NAME="487"></A>there being no garrison in the place, and the wall being weak. But it so 
<A NAME="488"></A>happened that Brasidas, son of Tellis, a Spartan, was in command of a guard 
<A NAME="489"></A>for the defence of the district. Hearing of the attack, he hurried with 
<A NAME="490"></A>a hundred heavy infantry to the assistance of the besieged, and dashing 
<A NAME="491"></A>through the army of the Athenians, which was scattered over the country 
<A NAME="492"></A>and had its attention turned to the wall, threw himself into Methone. He 
<A NAME="493"></A>lost a few men in making good his entrance, but saved the place and won 
<A NAME="494"></A>the thanks of Sparta by his exploit, being thus the first officer who obtained 
<A NAME="495"></A>this notice during the war. The Athenians at once weighed anchor and continued 
<A NAME="496"></A>their cruise. Touching at Pheia in Elis, they ravaged the country for two 
<A NAME="497"></A>days and defeated a picked force of three hundred men that had come from 
<A NAME="498"></A>the vale of Elis and the immediate neighbourhood to the rescue. But a stiff 
<A NAME="499"></A>squall came down upon them, and, not liking to face it in a place where 
<A NAME="500"></A>there was no harbour, most of them got on board their ships, and doubling 
<A NAME="501"></A>Point Ichthys sailed into the port of Pheia. In the meantime the Messenians, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and some others who could not get on board, marched over by land and took 
<A NAME="503"></A>Pheia. The fleet afterwards sailed round and picked them up and then put 
<A NAME="504"></A>to sea; Pheia being evacuated, as the main army of the Eleans had now come 
<A NAME="505"></A>up. The Athenians continued their cruise, and ravaged other places on the 
<A NAME="506"></A>coast.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>About the same time the Athenians sent thirty ships to cruise round 
<A NAME="508"></A>Locris and also to guard Euboea; Cleopompus, son of Clinias, being in command. 
<A NAME="509"></A>Making descents from the fleet he ravaged certain places on the sea-coast, 
<A NAME="510"></A>and captured Thronium and took hostages from it. He also defeated at Alope 
<A NAME="511"></A>the Locrians that had assembled to resist him.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>During the summer the Athenians also expelled the Aeginetans with 
<A NAME="513"></A>their wives and children from Aegina, on the ground of their having been 
<A NAME="514"></A>the chief agents in bringing the war upon them. Besides, Aegina lies so 
<A NAME="515"></A>near Peloponnese that it seemed safer to send colonists of their own to 
<A NAME="516"></A>hold it, and shortly afterwards the settlers were sent out. The banished 
<A NAME="517"></A>Aeginetans found an asylum in Thyrea, which was given to them by Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="518"></A>not only on account of her quarrel with Athens, but also because the Aeginetans 
<A NAME="519"></A>had laid her under obligations at the time of the earthquake and the revolt 
<A NAME="520"></A>of the Helots. The territory of Thyrea is on the frontier of Argolis and 
<A NAME="521"></A>Laconia, reaching down to the sea. Those of the Aeginetans who did not 
<A NAME="522"></A>settle here were scattered over the rest of Hellas.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>The same summer, at the beginning of a new lunar month, the only 
<A NAME="524"></A>time by the way at which it appears possible, the sun was eclipsed after 
<A NAME="525"></A>noon. After it had assumed the form of a crescent and some of the stars 
<A NAME="526"></A>had come out, it returned to its natural shape.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>During the same summer Nymphodorus, son of Pythes, an Abderite, 
<A NAME="528"></A>whose sister Sitalces had married, was made their proxenus by the Athenians 
<A NAME="529"></A>and sent for to Athens. They had hitherto considered him their enemy; but 
<A NAME="530"></A>he had great influence with Sitalces, and they wished this prince to become 
<A NAME="531"></A>their ally. Sitalces was the son of Teres and King of the Thracians. Teres, 
<A NAME="532"></A>the father of Sitalces, was the first to establish the great kingdom of 
<A NAME="533"></A>the Odrysians on a scale quite unknown to the rest of Thrace, a large portion 
<A NAME="534"></A>of the Thracians being independent. This Teres is in no way related to 
<A NAME="535"></A>Tereus who married Pandion's daughter Procne from Athens; nor indeed did 
<A NAME="536"></A>they belong to the same part of Thrace. Tereus lived in Daulis, part of 
<A NAME="537"></A>what is now called Phocis, but which at that time was inhabited by Thracians. 
<A NAME="538"></A>It was in this land that the women perpetrated the outrage upon Itys; and 
<A NAME="539"></A>many of the poets when they mention the nightingale call it the Daulian 
<A NAME="540"></A>bird. Besides, Pandion in contracting an alliance for his daughter would 
<A NAME="541"></A>consider the advantages of mutual assistance, and would naturally prefer 
<A NAME="542"></A>a match at the above moderate distance to the journey of many days which 
<A NAME="543"></A>separates Athens from the Odrysians. Again the names are different; and 
<A NAME="544"></A>this Teres was king of the Odrysians, the first by the way who attained 
<A NAME="545"></A>to any power. Sitalces, his son, was now sought as an ally by the Athenians, 
<A NAME="546"></A>who desired his aid in the reduction of the Thracian towns and of Perdiccas. 
<A NAME="547"></A>Coming to Athens, Nymphodorus concluded the alliance with Sitalces and 
<A NAME="548"></A>made his son Sadocus an Athenian citizen, and promised to finish the war 
<A NAME="549"></A>in Thrace by persuading Sitalces to send the Athenians a force of Thracian 
<A NAME="550"></A>horse and targeteers. He also reconciled them with Perdiccas, and induced 
<A NAME="551"></A>them to restore Therme to him; upon which Perdiccas at once joined the 
<A NAME="552"></A>Athenians and Phormio in an expedition against the Chalcidians. Thus Sitalces, 
<A NAME="553"></A>son of Teres, King of the Thracians, and Perdiccas, son of Alexander, King 
<A NAME="554"></A>of the Macedonians, became allies of Athens.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Athenians in the hundred vessels were still cruising 
<A NAME="556"></A>round Peloponnese. After taking Sollium, a town belonging to Corinth, and 
<A NAME="557"></A>presenting the city and territory to the Acarnanians of Palaira, they stormed 
<A NAME="558"></A>Astacus, expelled its tyrant Evarchus, and gained the place for their confederacy. 
<A NAME="559"></A>Next they sailed to the island of Cephallenia and brought it over without 
<A NAME="560"></A>using force. Cephallenia lies off Acarnania and Leucas, and consists of 
<A NAME="561"></A>four states, the Paleans, Cranians, Samaeans, and Pronaeans. Not long afterwards 
<A NAME="562"></A>the fleet returned to Athens. Towards the autumn of this year the Athenians 
<A NAME="563"></A>invaded the Megarid with their whole levy, resident aliens included, under 
<A NAME="564"></A>the command of Pericles, son of Xanthippus. The Athenians in the hundred 
<A NAME="565"></A>ships round Peloponnese on their journey home had just reached Aegina, 
<A NAME="566"></A>and hearing that the citizens at home were in full force at Megara, now 
<A NAME="567"></A>sailed over and joined them. This was without doubt the largest army of 
<A NAME="568"></A>Athenians ever assembled, the state being still in the flower of her strength 
<A NAME="569"></A>and yet unvisited by the plague. Full ten thousand heavy infantry were 
<A NAME="570"></A>in the field, all Athenian citizens, besides the three thousand before 
<A NAME="571"></A>Potidaea. Then the resident aliens who joined in the incursion were at 
<A NAME="572"></A>least three thousand strong; besides which there was a multitude of light 
<A NAME="573"></A>troops. They ravaged the greater part of the territory, and then retired. 
<A NAME="574"></A>Other incursions into the Megarid were afterwards made by the Athenians 
<A NAME="575"></A>annually during the war, sometimes only with cavalry, sometimes with all 
<A NAME="576"></A>their forces. This went on until the capture of Nisaea. Atalanta also, 
<A NAME="577"></A>the desert island off the Opuntian coast, was towards the end of this summer 
<A NAME="578"></A>converted into a fortified post by the Athenians, in order to prevent privateers 
<A NAME="579"></A>issuing from Opus and the rest of Locris and plundering Euboea. Such were 
<A NAME="580"></A>the events of this summer after the return of the Peloponnesians from 
<A NAME="581"></A>Attica.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>In the ensuing winter the Acarnanian Evarchus, wishing to return 
<A NAME="583"></A>to Astacus, persuaded the Corinthians to sail over with forty ships and 
<A NAME="584"></A>fifteen hundred heavy infantry and restore him; himself also hiring some 
<A NAME="585"></A>mercenaries. In command of the force were Euphamidas, son of Aristonymus, 
<A NAME="586"></A>Timoxenus, son of Timocrates, and Eumachus, son of Chrysis, who sailed 
<A NAME="587"></A>over and restored him and, after failing in an attempt on some places on 
<A NAME="588"></A>the Acarnanian coast which they were desirous of gaining, began their voyage 
<A NAME="589"></A>home. Coasting along shore they touched at Cephallenia and made a descent 
<A NAME="590"></A>on the Cranian territory, and losing some men by the treachery of the Cranians, 
<A NAME="591"></A>who fell suddenly upon them after having agreed to treat, put to sea somewhat 
<A NAME="592"></A>hurriedly and returned home.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>In the same winter the Athenians gave a funeral at the public cost 
<A NAME="594"></A>to those who had first fallen in this war. It was a custom of their ancestors, 
<A NAME="595"></A>and the manner of it is as follows. Three days before the ceremony, the 
<A NAME="596"></A>bones of the dead are laid out in a tent which has been erected; and their 
<A NAME="597"></A>friends bring to their relatives such offerings as they please. In the 
<A NAME="598"></A>funeral procession cypress coffins are borne in cars, one for each tribe; 
<A NAME="599"></A>the bones of the deceased being placed in the coffin of their tribe. Among 
<A NAME="600"></A>these is carried one empty bier decked for the missing, that is, for those 
<A NAME="601"></A>whose bodies could not be recovered. Any citizen or stranger who pleases, 
<A NAME="602"></A>joins in the procession: and the female relatives are there to wail at 
<A NAME="603"></A>the burial. The dead are laid in the public sepulchre in the Beautiful 
<A NAME="604"></A>suburb of the city, in which those who fall in war are always buried; with 
<A NAME="605"></A>the exception of those slain at Marathon, who for their singular and extraordinary 
<A NAME="606"></A>valour were interred on the spot where they fell. After the bodies have 
<A NAME="607"></A>been laid in the earth, a man chosen by the state, of approved wisdom and 
<A NAME="608"></A>eminent reputation, pronounces over them an appropriate panegyric; after 
<A NAME="609"></A>which all retire. Such is the manner of the burying; and throughout the 
<A NAME="610"></A>whole of the war, whenever the occasion arose, the established custom was 
<A NAME="611"></A>observed. Meanwhile these were the first that had fallen, and Pericles, 
<A NAME="612"></A>son of Xanthippus, was chosen to pronounce their eulogium. When the proper 
<A NAME="613"></A>time arrived, he advanced from the sepulchre to an elevated platform in 
<A NAME="614"></A>order to be heard by as many of the crowd as possible, and spoke as 
<A NAME="615"></A>follows:
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>"Most of my predecessors in this place have commended him who made 
<A NAME="617"></A>this speech part of the law, telling us that it is well that it should 
<A NAME="618"></A>be delivered at the burial of those who fall in battle. For myself, I should 
<A NAME="619"></A>have thought that the worth which had displayed itself in deeds would be 
<A NAME="620"></A>sufficiently rewarded by honours also shown by deeds; such as you now see 
<A NAME="621"></A>in this funeral prepared at the people's cost. And I could have wished 
<A NAME="622"></A>that the reputations of many brave men were not to be imperilled in the 
<A NAME="623"></A>mouth of a single individual, to stand or fall according as he spoke well 
<A NAME="624"></A>or ill. For it is hard to speak properly upon a subject where it is even 
<A NAME="625"></A>difficult to convince your hearers that you are speaking the truth. On 
<A NAME="626"></A>the one hand, the friend who is familiar with every fact of the story may 
<A NAME="627"></A>think that some point has not been set forth with that fullness which he 
<A NAME="628"></A>wishes and knows it to deserve; on the other, he who is a stranger to the 
<A NAME="629"></A>matter may be led by envy to suspect exaggeration if he hears anything 
<A NAME="630"></A>above his own nature. For men can endure to hear others praised only so 
<A NAME="631"></A>long as they can severally persuade themselves of their own ability to 
<A NAME="632"></A>equal the actions recounted: when this point is passed, envy comes in and 
<A NAME="633"></A>with it incredulity. However, since our ancestors have stamped this custom 
<A NAME="634"></A>with their approval, it becomes my duty to obey the law and to try to satisfy 
<A NAME="635"></A>your several wishes and opinions as best I may.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>"I shall begin with our ancestors: it is both just and proper that 
<A NAME="637"></A>they should have the honour of the first mention on an occasion like the 
<A NAME="638"></A>present. They dwelt in the country without break in the succession from 
<A NAME="639"></A>generation to generation, and handed it down free to the present time by 
<A NAME="640"></A>their valour. And if our more remote ancestors deserve praise, much more 
<A NAME="641"></A>do our own fathers, who added to their inheritance the empire which we 
<A NAME="642"></A>now possess, and spared no pains to be able to leave their acquisitions 
<A NAME="643"></A>to us of the present generation. Lastly, there are few parts of our dominions 
<A NAME="644"></A>that have not been augmented by those of us here, who are still more or 
<A NAME="645"></A>less in the vigour of life; while the mother country has been furnished 
<A NAME="646"></A>by us with everything that can enable her to depend on her own resources 
<A NAME="647"></A>whether for war or for peace. That part of our history which tells of the 
<A NAME="648"></A>military achievements which gave us our several possessions, or of the 
<A NAME="649"></A>ready valour with which either we or our fathers stemmed the tide of Hellenic 
<A NAME="650"></A>or foreign aggression, is a theme too familiar to my hearers for me to 
<A NAME="651"></A>dilate on, and I shall therefore pass it by. But what was the road by which 
<A NAME="652"></A>we reached our position, what the form of government under which our greatness 
<A NAME="653"></A>grew, what the national habits out of which it sprang; these are questions 
<A NAME="654"></A>which I may try to solve before I proceed to my panegyric upon these men; 
<A NAME="655"></A>since I think this to be a subject upon which on the present occasion a 
<A NAME="656"></A>speaker may properly dwell, and to which the whole assemblage, whether 
<A NAME="657"></A>citizens or foreigners, may listen with advantage.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>"Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; 
<A NAME="659"></A>we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration 
<A NAME="660"></A>favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. 
<A NAME="661"></A>If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private 
<A NAME="662"></A>differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to 
<A NAME="663"></A>reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere 
<A NAME="664"></A>with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve 
<A NAME="665"></A>the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom 
<A NAME="666"></A>which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, 
<A NAME="667"></A>far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel 
<A NAME="668"></A>called upon to be angry with our neighbour for doing what he likes, or 
<A NAME="669"></A>even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, 
<A NAME="670"></A>although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private 
<A NAME="671"></A>relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our 
<A NAME="672"></A>chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly 
<A NAME="673"></A>such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually 
<A NAME="674"></A>on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, 
<A NAME="675"></A>yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>"Further, we provide plenty of means for the mind to refresh itself 
<A NAME="677"></A>from business. We celebrate games and sacrifices all the year round, and 
<A NAME="678"></A>the elegance of our private establishments forms a daily source of pleasure 
<A NAME="679"></A>and helps to banish the spleen; while the magnitude of our city draws the 
<A NAME="680"></A>produce of the world into our harbour, so that to the Athenian the fruits 
<A NAME="681"></A>of other countries are as familiar a luxury as those of his 
<A NAME="682"></A>own.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>"If we turn to our military policy, there also we differ from our 
<A NAME="684"></A>antagonists. We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien acts 
<A NAME="685"></A>exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing, although 
<A NAME="686"></A>the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our liberality; trusting 
<A NAME="687"></A>less in system and policy than to the native spirit of our citizens; while 
<A NAME="688"></A>in education, where our rivals from their very cradles by a painful discipline 
<A NAME="689"></A>seek after manliness, at Athens we live exactly as we please, and yet are 
<A NAME="690"></A>just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger. In proof of this it 
<A NAME="691"></A>may be noticed that the Lacedaemonians do not invade our country alone, 
<A NAME="692"></A>but bring with them all their confederates; while we Athenians advance 
<A NAME="693"></A>unsupported into the territory of a neighbour, and fighting upon a foreign 
<A NAME="694"></A>soil usually vanquish with ease men who are defending their homes. Our 
<A NAME="695"></A>united force was never yet encountered by any enemy, because we have at 
<A NAME="696"></A>once to attend to our marine and to dispatch our citizens by land upon 
<A NAME="697"></A>a hundred different services; so that, wherever they engage with some such 
<A NAME="698"></A>fraction of our strength, a success against a detachment is magnified into 
<A NAME="699"></A>a victory over the nation, and a defeat into a reverse suffered at the 
<A NAME="700"></A>hands of our entire people. And yet if with habits not of labour but of 
<A NAME="701"></A>ease, and courage not of art but of nature, we are still willing to encounter 
<A NAME="702"></A>danger, we have the double advantage of escaping the experience of hardships 
<A NAME="703"></A>in anticipation and of facing them in the hour of need as fearlessly as 
<A NAME="704"></A>those who are never free from them.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>"Nor are these the only points in which our city is worthy of admiration. 
<A NAME="706"></A>We cultivate refinement without extravagance and knowledge without effeminacy; 
<A NAME="707"></A>wealth we employ more for use than for show, and place the real disgrace 
<A NAME="708"></A>of poverty not in owning to the fact but in declining the struggle against 
<A NAME="709"></A>it. Our public men have, besides politics, their private affairs to attend 
<A NAME="710"></A>to, and our ordinary citizens, though occupied with the pursuits of industry, 
<A NAME="711"></A>are still fair judges of public matters; for, unlike any other nation, 
<A NAME="712"></A>regarding him who takes no part in these duties not as unambitious but 
<A NAME="713"></A>as useless, we Athenians are able to judge at all events if we cannot originate, 
<A NAME="714"></A>and, instead of looking on discussion as a stumbling-block in the way of 
<A NAME="715"></A>action, we think it an indispensable preliminary to any wise action at 
<A NAME="716"></A>all. Again, in our enterprises we present the singular spectacle of daring 
<A NAME="717"></A>and deliberation, each carried to its highest point, and both united in 
<A NAME="718"></A>the same persons; although usually decision is the fruit of ignorance, 
<A NAME="719"></A>hesitation of reflection. But the palm of courage will surely be adjudged 
<A NAME="720"></A>most justly to those, who best know the difference between hardship and 
<A NAME="721"></A>pleasure and yet are never tempted to shrink from danger. In generosity 
<A NAME="722"></A>we are equally singular, acquiring our friends by conferring, not by receiving, 
<A NAME="723"></A>favours. Yet, of course, the doer of the favour is the firmer friend of 
<A NAME="724"></A>the two, in order by continued kindness to keep the recipient in his debt; 
<A NAME="725"></A>while the debtor feels less keenly from the very consciousness that the 
<A NAME="726"></A>return he makes will be a payment, not a free gift. And it is only the 
<A NAME="727"></A>Athenians, who, fearless of consequences, confer their benefits not from 
<A NAME="728"></A>calculations of expediency, but in the confidence of 
<A NAME="729"></A>liberality.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>"In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas, while 
<A NAME="731"></A>I doubt if the world can produce a man who, where he has only himself to 
<A NAME="732"></A>depend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a 
<A NAME="733"></A>versatility, as the Athenian. And that this is no mere boast thrown out 
<A NAME="734"></A>for the occasion, but plain matter of fact, the power of the state acquired 
<A NAME="735"></A>by these habits proves. For Athens alone of her contemporaries is found 
<A NAME="736"></A>when tested to be greater than her reputation, and alone gives no occasion 
<A NAME="737"></A>to her assailants to blush at the antagonist by whom they have been worsted, 
<A NAME="738"></A>or to her subjects to question her title by merit to rule. Rather, the 
<A NAME="739"></A>admiration of the present and succeeding ages will be ours, since we have 
<A NAME="740"></A>not left our power without witness, but have shown it by mighty proofs; 
<A NAME="741"></A>and far from needing a Homer for our panegyrist, or other of his craft 
<A NAME="742"></A>whose verses might charm for the moment only for the impression which they 
<A NAME="743"></A>gave to melt at the touch of fact, we have forced every sea and land to 
<A NAME="744"></A>be the highway of our daring, and everywhere, whether for evil or for good, 
<A NAME="745"></A>have left imperishable monuments behind us. Such is the Athens for which 
<A NAME="746"></A>these men, in the assertion of their resolve not to lose her, nobly fought 
<A NAME="747"></A>and died; and well may every one of their survivors be ready to suffer 
<A NAME="748"></A>in her cause.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>"Indeed if I have dwelt at some length upon the character of our 
<A NAME="750"></A>country, it has been to show that our stake in the struggle is not the 
<A NAME="751"></A>same as theirs who have no such blessings to lose, and also that the panegyric 
<A NAME="752"></A>of the men over whom I am now speaking might be by definite proofs established. 
<A NAME="753"></A>That panegyric is now in a great measure complete; for the Athens that 
<A NAME="754"></A>I have celebrated is only what the heroism of these and their like have 
<A NAME="755"></A>made her, men whose fame, unlike that of most Hellenes, will be found to 
<A NAME="756"></A>be only commensurate with their deserts. And if a test of worth be wanted, 
<A NAME="757"></A>it is to be found in their closing scene, and this not only in cases in 
<A NAME="758"></A>which it set the final seal upon their merit, but also in those in which 
<A NAME="759"></A>it gave the first intimation of their having any. For there is justice 
<A NAME="760"></A>in the claim that steadfastness in his country's battles should be as a 
<A NAME="761"></A>cloak to cover a man's other imperfections; since the good action has blotted 
<A NAME="762"></A>out the bad, and his merit as a citizen more than outweighed his demerits 
<A NAME="763"></A>as an individual. But none of these allowed either wealth with its prospect 
<A NAME="764"></A>of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of 
<A NAME="765"></A>a day of freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger. No, holding 
<A NAME="766"></A>that vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal 
<A NAME="767"></A>blessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they 
<A NAME="768"></A>joyfully determined to accept the risk, to make sure of their vengeance, 
<A NAME="769"></A>and to let their wishes wait; and while committing to hope the uncertainty 
<A NAME="770"></A>of final success, in the business before them they thought fit to act boldly 
<A NAME="771"></A>and trust in themselves. Thus choosing to die resisting, rather than to 
<A NAME="772"></A>live submitting, they fled only from dishonour, but met danger face to 
<A NAME="773"></A>face, and after one brief moment, while at the summit of their fortune, 
<A NAME="774"></A>escaped, not from their fear, but from their glory.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>"So died these men as became Athenians. You, their survivors, must 
<A NAME="776"></A>determine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field, though you 
<A NAME="777"></A>may pray that it may have a happier issue. And not contented with ideas 
<A NAME="778"></A>derived only from words of the advantages which are bound up with the defence 
<A NAME="779"></A>of your country, though these would furnish a valuable text to a speaker 
<A NAME="780"></A>even before an audience so alive to them as the present, you must yourselves 
<A NAME="781"></A>realize the power of Athens, and feed your eyes upon her from day to day, 
<A NAME="782"></A>till love of her fills your hearts; and then, when all her greatness shall 
<A NAME="783"></A>break upon you, you must reflect that it was by courage, sense of duty, 
<A NAME="784"></A>and a keen feeling of honour in action that men were enabled to win all 
<A NAME="785"></A>this, and that no personal failure in an enterprise could make them consent 
<A NAME="786"></A>to deprive their country of their valour, but they laid it at her feet 
<A NAME="787"></A>as the most glorious contribution that they could offer. For this offering 
<A NAME="788"></A>of their lives made in common by them all they each of them individually 
<A NAME="789"></A>received that renown which never grows old, and for a sepulchre, not so 
<A NAME="790"></A>much that in which their bones have been deposited, but that noblest of 
<A NAME="791"></A>shrines wherein their glory is laid up to be eternally remembered upon 
<A NAME="792"></A>every occasion on which deed or story shall call for its commemoration. 
<A NAME="793"></A>For heroes have the whole earth for their tomb; and in lands far from their 
<A NAME="794"></A>own, where the column with its epitaph declares it, there is enshrined 
<A NAME="795"></A>in every breast a record unwritten with no tablet to preserve it, except 
<A NAME="796"></A>that of the heart. These take as your model and, judging happiness to be 
<A NAME="797"></A>the fruit of freedom and freedom of valour, never decline the dangers of 
<A NAME="798"></A>war. For it is not the miserable that would most justly be unsparing of 
<A NAME="799"></A>their lives; these have nothing to hope for: it is rather they to whom 
<A NAME="800"></A>continued life may bring reverses as yet unknown, and to whom a fall, if 
<A NAME="801"></A>it came, would be most tremendous in its consequences. And surely, to a 
<A NAME="802"></A>man of spirit, the degradation of cowardice must be immeasurably more grievous 
<A NAME="803"></A>than the unfelt death which strikes him in the midst of his strength and 
<A NAME="804"></A>patriotism!
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>"Comfort, therefore, not condolence, is what I have to offer to 
<A NAME="806"></A>the parents of the dead who may be here. Numberless are the chances to 
<A NAME="807"></A>which, as they know, the life of man is subject; but fortunate indeed are 
<A NAME="808"></A>they who draw for their lot a death so glorious as that which has caused 
<A NAME="809"></A>your mourning, and to whom life has been so exactly measured as to terminate 
<A NAME="810"></A>in the happiness in which it has been passed. Still I know that this is 
<A NAME="811"></A>a hard saying, especially when those are in question of whom you will constantly 
<A NAME="812"></A>be reminded by seeing in the homes of others blessings of which once you 
<A NAME="813"></A>also boasted: for grief is felt not so much for the want of what we have 
<A NAME="814"></A>never known, as for the loss of that to which we have been long accustomed. 
<A NAME="815"></A>Yet you who are still of an age to beget children must bear up in the hope 
<A NAME="816"></A>of having others in their stead; not only will they help you to forget 
<A NAME="817"></A>those whom you have lost, but will be to the state at once a reinforcement 
<A NAME="818"></A>and a security; for never can a fair or just policy be expected of the 
<A NAME="819"></A>citizen who does not, like his fellows, bring to the decision the interests 
<A NAME="820"></A>and apprehensions of a father. While those of you who have passed your 
<A NAME="821"></A>prime must congratulate yourselves with the thought that the best part 
<A NAME="822"></A>of your life was fortunate, and that the brief span that remains will be 
<A NAME="823"></A>cheered by the fame of the departed. For it is only the love of honour 
<A NAME="824"></A>that never grows old; and honour it is, not gain, as some would have it, 
<A NAME="825"></A>that rejoices the heart of age and helplessness.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>"Turning to the sons or brothers of the dead, I see an arduous 
<A NAME="827"></A>struggle before you. When a man is gone, all are wont to praise him, and 
<A NAME="828"></A>should your merit be ever so transcendent, you will still find it difficult 
<A NAME="829"></A>not merely to overtake, but even to approach their renown. The living have 
<A NAME="830"></A>envy to contend with, while those who are no longer in our path are honoured 
<A NAME="831"></A>with a goodwill into which rivalry does not enter. On the other hand, if 
<A NAME="832"></A>I must say anything on the subject of female excellence to those of you 
<A NAME="833"></A>who will now be in widowhood, it will be all comprised in this brief exhortation. 
<A NAME="834"></A>Great will be your glory in not falling short of your natural character; 
<A NAME="835"></A>and greatest will be hers who is least talked of among the men, whether 
<A NAME="836"></A>for good or for bad.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>"My task is now finished. I have performed it to the best of my 
<A NAME="838"></A>ability, and in word, at least, the requirements of the law are now satisfied. 
<A NAME="839"></A>If deeds be in question, those who are here interred have received part 
<A NAME="840"></A>of their honours already, and for the rest, their children will be brought 
<A NAME="841"></A>up till manhood at the public expense: the state thus offers a valuable 
<A NAME="842"></A>prize, as the garland of victory in this race of valour, for the reward 
<A NAME="843"></A>both of those who have fallen and their survivors. And where the rewards 
<A NAME="844"></A>for merit are greatest, there are found the best citizens.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>"And now that you have brought to a close your lamentations for 
<A NAME="846"></A>your relatives, you may depart."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="847"></A><B>Chapter VII</B>

<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR><B>Second Year of the War - The Plague of Athens</B> <B>- Position 
<A NAME="849"></A>and Policy of Pericles - Fall</B> <B>of Potidaea</B>
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>Such was the funeral that took place during this winter, with which 
<A NAME="851"></A>the first year of the war came to an end. In the first days of summer the 
<A NAME="852"></A>Lacedaemonians and their allies, with two-thirds of their forces as before, 
<A NAME="853"></A>invaded Attica, under the command of Archidamus, son of Zeuxidamus, King 
<A NAME="854"></A>of Lacedaemon, and sat down and laid waste the country. Not many days after 
<A NAME="855"></A>their arrival in Attica the plague first began to show itself among the 
<A NAME="856"></A>Athenians. It was said that it had broken out in many places previously 
<A NAME="857"></A>in the neighbourhood of Lemnos and elsewhere; but a pestilence of such 
<A NAME="858"></A>extent and mortality was nowhere remembered. Neither were the physicians 
<A NAME="859"></A>at first of any service, ignorant as they were of the proper way to treat 
<A NAME="860"></A>it, but they died themselves the most thickly, as they visited the sick 
<A NAME="861"></A>most often; nor did any human art succeed any better. Supplications in 
<A NAME="862"></A>the temples, divinations, and so forth were found equally futile, till 
<A NAME="863"></A>the overwhelming nature of the disaster at last put a stop to them 
<A NAME="864"></A>altogether.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR>It first began, it is said, in the parts of Ethiopia above Egypt, 
<A NAME="866"></A>and thence descended into Egypt and Libya and into most of the King's country. 
<A NAME="867"></A>Suddenly falling upon Athens, it first attacked the population in Piraeus- 
<A NAME="868"></A>which was the occasion of their saying that the Peloponnesians had poisoned 
<A NAME="869"></A>the reservoirs, there being as yet no wells there- and afterwards appeared 
<A NAME="870"></A>in the upper city, when the deaths became much more frequent. All speculation 
<A NAME="871"></A>as to its origin and its causes, if causes can be found adequate to produce 
<A NAME="872"></A>so great a disturbance, I leave to other writers, whether lay or professional; 
<A NAME="873"></A>for myself, I shall simply set down its nature, and explain the symptoms 
<A NAME="874"></A>by which perhaps it may be recognized by the student, if it should ever 
<A NAME="875"></A>break out again. This I can the better do, as I had the disease myself, 
<A NAME="876"></A>and watched its operation in the case of others.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>That year then is admitted to have been otherwise unprecedentedly 
<A NAME="878"></A>free from sickness; and such few cases as occurred all determined in this. 
<A NAME="879"></A>As a rule, however, there was no ostensible cause; but people in good health 
<A NAME="880"></A>were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head, and redness 
<A NAME="881"></A>and inflammation in the eyes, the inward parts, such as the throat or tongue, 
<A NAME="882"></A>becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid breath. These symptoms 
<A NAME="883"></A>were followed by sneezing and hoarseness, after which the pain soon reached 
<A NAME="884"></A>the chest, and produced a hard cough. When it fixed in the stomach, it 
<A NAME="885"></A>upset it; and discharges of bile of every kind named by physicians ensued, 
<A NAME="886"></A>accompanied by very great distress. In most cases also an ineffectual retching 
<A NAME="887"></A>followed, producing violent spasms, which in some cases ceased soon after, 
<A NAME="888"></A>in others much later. Externally the body was not very hot to the touch, 
<A NAME="889"></A>nor pale in its appearance, but reddish, livid, and breaking out into small 
<A NAME="890"></A>pustules and ulcers. But internally it burned so that the patient could 
<A NAME="891"></A>not bear to have on him clothing or linen even of the very lightest description; 
<A NAME="892"></A>or indeed to be otherwise than stark naked. What they would have liked 
<A NAME="893"></A>best would have been to throw themselves into cold water; as indeed was 
<A NAME="894"></A>done by some of the neglected sick, who plunged into the rain-tanks in 
<A NAME="895"></A>their agonies of unquenchable thirst; though it made no difference whether 
<A NAME="896"></A>they drank little or much. Besides this, the miserable feeling of not being 
<A NAME="897"></A>able to rest or sleep never ceased to torment them. The body meanwhile 
<A NAME="898"></A>did not waste away so long as the distemper was at its height, but held 
<A NAME="899"></A>out to a marvel against its ravages; so that when they succumbed, as in 
<A NAME="900"></A>most cases, on the seventh or eighth day to the internal inflammation, 
<A NAME="901"></A>they had still some strength in them. But if they passed this stage, and 
<A NAME="902"></A>the disease descended further into the bowels, inducing a violent ulceration 
<A NAME="903"></A>there accompanied by severe diarrhoea, this brought on a weakness which 
<A NAME="904"></A>was generally fatal. For the disorder first settled in the head, ran its 
<A NAME="905"></A>course from thence through the whole of the body, and, even where it did 
<A NAME="906"></A>not prove mortal, it still left its mark on the extremities; for it settled 
<A NAME="907"></A>in the privy parts, the fingers and the toes, and many escaped with the 
<A NAME="908"></A>loss of these, some too with that of their eyes. Others again were seized 
<A NAME="909"></A>with an entire loss of memory on their first recovery, and did not know 
<A NAME="910"></A>either themselves or their friends.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>But while the nature of the distemper was such as to baffle all 
<A NAME="912"></A>description, and its attacks almost too grievous for human nature to endure, 
<A NAME="913"></A>it was still in the following circumstance that its difference from all 
<A NAME="914"></A>ordinary disorders was most clearly shown. All the birds and beasts that 
<A NAME="915"></A>prey upon human bodies, either abstained from touching them (though there 
<A NAME="916"></A>were many lying unburied), or died after tasting them. In proof of this, 
<A NAME="917"></A>it was noticed that birds of this kind actually disappeared; they were 
<A NAME="918"></A>not about the bodies, or indeed to be seen at all. But of course the effects 
<A NAME="919"></A>which I have mentioned could best be studied in a domestic animal like 
<A NAME="920"></A>the dog.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>Such then, if we pass over the varieties of particular cases which 
<A NAME="922"></A>were many and peculiar, were the general features of the distemper. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="923"></A>the town enjoyed an immunity from all the ordinary disorders; or if any 
<A NAME="924"></A>case occurred, it ended in this. Some died in neglect, others in the midst 
<A NAME="925"></A>of every attention. No remedy was found that could be used as a specific; 
<A NAME="926"></A>for what did good in one case, did harm in another. Strong and weak constitutions 
<A NAME="927"></A>proved equally incapable of resistance, all alike being swept away, although 
<A NAME="928"></A>dieted with the utmost precaution. By far the most terrible feature in 
<A NAME="929"></A>the malady was the dejection which ensued when any one felt himself sickening, 
<A NAME="930"></A>for the despair into which they instantly fell took away their power of 
<A NAME="931"></A>resistance, and left them a much easier prey to the disorder; besides which, 
<A NAME="932"></A>there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught 
<A NAME="933"></A>the infection in nursing each other. This caused the greatest mortality. 
<A NAME="934"></A>On the one hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished 
<A NAME="935"></A>from neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want 
<A NAME="936"></A>of a nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the consequence. 
<A NAME="937"></A>This was especially the case with such as made any pretensions to goodness: 
<A NAME="938"></A>honour made them unsparing of themselves in their attendance in their friends' 
<A NAME="939"></A>houses, where even the members of the family were at last worn out by the 
<A NAME="940"></A>moans of the dying, and succumbed to the force of the disaster. Yet it 
<A NAME="941"></A>was with those who had recovered from the disease that the sick and the 
<A NAME="942"></A>dying found most compassion. These knew what it was from experience, and 
<A NAME="943"></A>had now no fear for themselves; for the same man was never attacked twice- 
<A NAME="944"></A>never at least fatally. And such persons not only received the congratulations 
<A NAME="945"></A>of others, but themselves also, in the elation of the moment, half entertained 
<A NAME="946"></A>the vain hope that they were for the future safe from any disease 
<A NAME="947"></A>whatsoever.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>An aggravation of the existing calamity was the influx from the 
<A NAME="949"></A>country into the city, and this was especially felt by the new arrivals. 
<A NAME="950"></A>As there were no houses to receive them, they had to be lodged at the hot 
<A NAME="951"></A>season of the year in stifling cabins, where the mortality raged without 
<A NAME="952"></A>restraint. The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and half-dead 
<A NAME="953"></A>creatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the fountains 
<A NAME="954"></A>in their longing for water. The sacred places also in which they had quartered 
<A NAME="955"></A>themselves were full of corpses of persons that had died there, just as 
<A NAME="956"></A>they were; for as the disaster passed all bounds, men, not knowing what 
<A NAME="957"></A>was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred 
<A NAME="958"></A>or profane. All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset, and 
<A NAME="959"></A>they buried the bodies as best they could. Many from want of the proper 
<A NAME="960"></A>appliances, through so many of their friends having died already, had recourse 
<A NAME="961"></A>to the most shameless sepultures: sometimes getting the start of those 
<A NAME="962"></A>who had raised a pile, they threw their own dead body upon the stranger's 
<A NAME="963"></A>pyre and ignited it; sometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying 
<A NAME="964"></A>on the top of another that was burning, and so went 
<A NAME="965"></A>off.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR><BR>Nor was this the only form of lawless extravagance which owed its 
<A NAME="967"></A>origin to the plague. Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly 
<A NAME="968"></A>done in a corner, and not just as they pleased, seeing the rapid transitions 
<A NAME="969"></A>produced by persons in prosperity suddenly dying and those who before had 
<A NAME="970"></A>nothing succeeding to their property. So they resolved to spend quickly 
<A NAME="971"></A>and enjoy themselves, regarding their lives and riches as alike things 
<A NAME="972"></A>of a day. Perseverance in what men called honour was popular with none, 
<A NAME="973"></A>it was so uncertain whether they would be spared to attain the object; 
<A NAME="974"></A>but it was settled that present enjoyment, and all that contributed to 
<A NAME="975"></A>it, was both honourable and useful. Fear of gods or law of man there was 
<A NAME="976"></A>none to restrain them. As for the first, they judged it to be just the 
<A NAME="977"></A>same whether they worshipped them or not, as they saw all alike perishing; 
<A NAME="978"></A>and for the last, no one expected to live to be brought to trial for his 
<A NAME="979"></A>offences, but each felt that a far severer sentence had been already passed 
<A NAME="980"></A>upon them all and hung ever over their heads, and before this fell it was 
<A NAME="981"></A>only reasonable to enjoy life a little.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>Such was the nature of the calamity, and heavily did it weigh on 
<A NAME="983"></A>the Athenians; death raging within the city and devastation without. Among 
<A NAME="984"></A>other things which they remembered in their distress was, very naturally, 
<A NAME="985"></A>the following verse which the old men said had long ago been 
<A NAME="986"></A>uttered:
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>A Dorian war shall come and with it death. So a dispute arose as 
<A NAME="988"></A>to whether dearth and not death had not been the word in the verse; but 
<A NAME="989"></A>at the present juncture, it was of course decided in favour of the latter; 
<A NAME="990"></A>for the people made their recollection fit in with their sufferings. I 
<A NAME="991"></A>fancy, however, that if another Dorian war should ever afterwards come 
<A NAME="992"></A>upon us, and a dearth should happen to accompany it, the verse will probably 
<A NAME="993"></A>be read accordingly. The oracle also which had been given to the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="994"></A>was now remembered by those who knew of it. When the god was asked whether 
<A NAME="995"></A>they should go to war, he answered that if they put their might into it, 
<A NAME="996"></A>victory would be theirs, and that he would himself be with them. With this 
<A NAME="997"></A>oracle events were supposed to tally. For the plague broke out as soon 
<A NAME="998"></A>as the Peloponnesians invaded Attica, and never entering Peloponnese (not 
<A NAME="999"></A>at least to an extent worth noticing), committed its worst ravages at Athens, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>and next to Athens, at the most populous of the other towns. Such was the 
<A NAME="1001"></A>history of the plague.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>After ravaging the plain, the Peloponnesians advanced into the 
<A NAME="1003"></A>Paralian region as far as Laurium, where the Athenian silver mines are, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>and first laid waste the side looking towards Peloponnese, next that which 
<A NAME="1005"></A>faces Euboea and Andros. But Pericles, who was still general, held the 
<A NAME="1006"></A>same opinion as in the former invasion, and would not let the Athenians 
<A NAME="1007"></A>march out against them.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>However, while they were still in the plain, and had not yet entered 
<A NAME="1009"></A>the Paralian land, he had prepared an armament of a hundred ships for Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>and when all was ready put out to sea. On board the ships he took four 
<A NAME="1011"></A>thousand Athenian heavy infantry, and three hundred cavalry in horse transports, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>and then for the first time made out of old galleys; fifty Chian and Lesbian 
<A NAME="1013"></A>vessels also joining in the expedition. When this Athenian armament put 
<A NAME="1014"></A>out to sea, they left the Peloponnesians in Attica in the Paralian region. 
<A NAME="1015"></A>Arriving at Epidaurus in Peloponnese they ravaged most of the territory, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>and even had hopes of taking the town by an assault: in this however they 
<A NAME="1017"></A>were not successful. Putting out from Epidaurus, they laid waste the territory 
<A NAME="1018"></A>of Troezen, Halieis, and Hermione, all towns on the coast of Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>and thence sailing to Prasiai, a maritime town in Laconia, ravaged part 
<A NAME="1020"></A>of its territory, and took and sacked the place itself; after which they 
<A NAME="1021"></A>returned home, but found the Peloponnesians gone and no longer in 
<A NAME="1022"></A>Attica.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>During the whole time that the Peloponnesians were in Attica and 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the Athenians on the expedition in their ships, men kept dying of the plague 
<A NAME="1025"></A>both in the armament and in Athens. Indeed it was actually asserted that 
<A NAME="1026"></A>the departure of the Peloponnesians was hastened by fear of the disorder; 
<A NAME="1027"></A>as they heard from deserters that it was in the city, and also could see 
<A NAME="1028"></A>the burials going on. Yet in this invasion they remained longer than in 
<A NAME="1029"></A>any other, and ravaged the whole country, for they were about forty days 
<A NAME="1030"></A>in Attica.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>The same summer Hagnon, son of Nicias, and Cleopompus, son of Clinias, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>the colleagues of Pericles, took the armament of which he had lately made 
<A NAME="1033"></A>use, and went off upon an expedition against the Chalcidians in the direction 
<A NAME="1034"></A>of Thrace and Potidaea, which was still under siege. As soon as they arrived, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>they brought up their engines against Potidaea and tried every means of 
<A NAME="1036"></A>taking it, but did not succeed either in capturing the city or in doing 
<A NAME="1037"></A>anything else worthy of their preparations. For the plague attacked them 
<A NAME="1038"></A>here also, and committed such havoc as to cripple them completely, even 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the previously healthy soldiers of the former expedition catching the infection 
<A NAME="1040"></A>from Hagnon's troops; while Phormio and the sixteen hundred men whom he 
<A NAME="1041"></A>commanded only escaped by being no longer in the neighbourhood of the Chalcidians. 
<A NAME="1042"></A>The end of it was that Hagnon returned with his ships to Athens, having 
<A NAME="1043"></A>lost one thousand and fifty out of four thousand heavy infantry in about 
<A NAME="1044"></A>forty days; though the soldiers stationed there before remained in the 
<A NAME="1045"></A>country and carried on the siege of Potidaea.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>After the second invasion of the Peloponnesians a change came over 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the spirit of the Athenians. Their land had now been twice laid waste; 
<A NAME="1048"></A>and war and pestilence at once pressed heavy upon them. They began to find 
<A NAME="1049"></A>fault with Pericles, as the author of the war and the cause of all their 
<A NAME="1050"></A>misfortunes, and became eager to come to terms with Lacedaemon, and actually 
<A NAME="1051"></A>sent ambassadors thither, who did not however succeed in their mission. 
<A NAME="1052"></A>Their despair was now complete and all vented itself upon Pericles. When 
<A NAME="1053"></A>he saw them exasperated at the present turn of affairs and acting exactly 
<A NAME="1054"></A>as he had anticipated, he called an assembly, being (it must be remembered) 
<A NAME="1055"></A>still general, with the double object of restoring confidence and of leading 
<A NAME="1056"></A>them from these angry feelings to a calmer and more hopeful state of mind. 
<A NAME="1057"></A>He accordingly came forward and spoke as follows:
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>"I was not unprepared for the indignation of which I have been 
<A NAME="1059"></A>the object, as I know its causes; and I have called an assembly for the 
<A NAME="1060"></A>purpose of reminding you upon certain points, and of protesting against 
<A NAME="1061"></A>your being unreasonably irritated with me, or cowed by your sufferings. 
<A NAME="1062"></A>I am of opinion that national greatness is more for the advantage of private 
<A NAME="1063"></A>citizens, than any individual well-being coupled with public humiliation. 
<A NAME="1064"></A>A man may be personally ever so well off, and yet if his country be ruined 
<A NAME="1065"></A>he must be ruined with it; whereas a flourishing commonwealth always affords 
<A NAME="1066"></A>chances of salvation to unfortunate individuals. Since then a state can 
<A NAME="1067"></A>support the misfortunes of private citizens, while they cannot support 
<A NAME="1068"></A>hers, it is surely the duty of every one to be forward in her defence, 
<A NAME="1069"></A>and not like you to be so confounded with your domestic afflictions as 
<A NAME="1070"></A>to give up all thoughts of the common safety, and to blame me for having 
<A NAME="1071"></A>counselled war and yourselves for having voted it. And yet if you are angry 
<A NAME="1072"></A>with me, it is with one who, as I believe, is second to no man either in 
<A NAME="1073"></A>knowledge of the proper policy, or in the ability to expound it, and who 
<A NAME="1074"></A>is moreover not only a patriot but an honest one. A man possessing that 
<A NAME="1075"></A>knowledge without that faculty of exposition might as well have no idea 
<A NAME="1076"></A>at all on the matter: if he had both these gifts, but no love for his country, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>he would be but a cold advocate for her interests; while were his patriotism 
<A NAME="1078"></A>not proof against bribery, everything would go for a price. So that if 
<A NAME="1079"></A>you thought that I was even moderately distinguished for these qualities 
<A NAME="1080"></A>when you took my advice and went to war, there is certainly no reason now 
<A NAME="1081"></A>why I should be charged with having done wrong.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>"For those of course who have a free choice in the matter and whose 
<A NAME="1083"></A>fortunes are not at stake, war is the greatest of follies. But if the only 
<A NAME="1084"></A>choice was between submission with loss of independence, and danger with 
<A NAME="1085"></A>the hope of preserving that independence, in such a case it is he who will 
<A NAME="1086"></A>not accept the risk that deserves blame, not he who will. I am the same 
<A NAME="1087"></A>man and do not alter, it is you who change, since in fact you took my advice 
<A NAME="1088"></A>while unhurt, and waited for misfortune to repent of it; and the apparent 
<A NAME="1089"></A>error of my policy lies in the infirmity of your resolution, since the 
<A NAME="1090"></A>suffering that it entails is being felt by every one among you, while its 
<A NAME="1091"></A>advantage is still remote and obscure to all, and a great and sudden reverse 
<A NAME="1092"></A>having befallen you, your mind is too much depressed to persevere in your 
<A NAME="1093"></A>resolves. For before what is sudden, unexpected, and least within calculation, 
<A NAME="1094"></A>the spirit quails; and putting all else aside, the plague has certainly 
<A NAME="1095"></A>been an emergency of this kind. Born, however, as you are, citizens of 
<A NAME="1096"></A>a great state, and brought up, as you have been, with habits equal to your 
<A NAME="1097"></A>birth, you should be ready to face the greatest disasters and still to 
<A NAME="1098"></A>keep unimpaired the lustre of your name. For the judgment of mankind is 
<A NAME="1099"></A>as relentless to the weakness that falls short of a recognized renown, 
<A NAME="1100"></A>as it is jealous of the arrogance that aspires higher than its due. Cease 
<A NAME="1101"></A>then to grieve for your private afflictions, and address yourselves instead 
<A NAME="1102"></A>to the safety of the commonwealth.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR><BR>"If you shrink before the exertions which the war makes necessary, 
<A NAME="1104"></A>and fear that after all they may not have a happy result, you know the 
<A NAME="1105"></A>reasons by which I have often demonstrated to you the groundlessness of 
<A NAME="1106"></A>your apprehensions. If those are not enough, I will now reveal an advantage 
<A NAME="1107"></A>arising from the greatness of your dominion, which I think has never yet 
<A NAME="1108"></A>suggested itself to you, which I never mentioned in my previous speeches, 
<A NAME="1109"></A>and which has so bold a sound that I should scarce adventure it now, were 
<A NAME="1110"></A>it not for the unnatural depression which I see around me. You perhaps 
<A NAME="1111"></A>think that your empire extends only over your allies; I will declare to 
<A NAME="1112"></A>you the truth. The visible field of action has two parts, land and sea. 
<A NAME="1113"></A>In the whole of one of these you are completely supreme, not merely as 
<A NAME="1114"></A>far as you use it at present, but also to what further extent you may think 
<A NAME="1115"></A>fit: in fine, your naval resources are such that your vessels may go where 
<A NAME="1116"></A>they please, without the King or any other nation on earth being able to 
<A NAME="1117"></A>stop them. So that although you may think it a great privation to lose 
<A NAME="1118"></A>the use of your land and houses, still you must see that this power is 
<A NAME="1119"></A>something widely different; and instead of fretting on their account, you 
<A NAME="1120"></A>should really regard them in the light of the gardens and other accessories 
<A NAME="1121"></A>that embellish a great fortune, and as, in comparison, of little moment. 
<A NAME="1122"></A>You should know too that liberty preserved by your efforts will easily 
<A NAME="1123"></A>recover for us what we have lost, while, the knee once bowed, even what 
<A NAME="1124"></A>you have will pass from you. Your fathers receiving these possessions not 
<A NAME="1125"></A>from others, but from themselves, did not let slip what their labour had 
<A NAME="1126"></A>acquired, but delivered them safe to you; and in this respect at least 
<A NAME="1127"></A>you must prove yourselves their equals, remembering that to lose what one 
<A NAME="1128"></A>has got is more disgraceful than to be balked in getting, and you must 
<A NAME="1129"></A>confront your enemies not merely with spirit but with disdain. Confidence 
<A NAME="1130"></A>indeed a blissful ignorance can impart, ay, even to a coward's breast, 
<A NAME="1131"></A>but disdain is the privilege of those who, like us, have been assured by 
<A NAME="1132"></A>reflection of their superiority to their adversary. And where the chances 
<A NAME="1133"></A>are the same, knowledge fortifies courage by the contempt which is its 
<A NAME="1134"></A>consequence, its trust being placed, not in hope, which is the prop of 
<A NAME="1135"></A>the desperate, but in a judgment grounded upon existing resources, whose 
<A NAME="1136"></A>anticipations are more to be depended upon.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR><BR>"Again, your country has a right to your services in sustaining 
<A NAME="1138"></A>the glories of her position. These are a common source of pride to you 
<A NAME="1139"></A>all, and you cannot decline the burdens of empire and still expect to share 
<A NAME="1140"></A>its honours. You should remember also that what you are fighting against 
<A NAME="1141"></A>is not merely slavery as an exchange for independence, but also loss of 
<A NAME="1142"></A>empire and danger from the animosities incurred in its exercise. Besides, 
<A NAME="1143"></A>to recede is no longer possible, if indeed any of you in the alarm of the 
<A NAME="1144"></A>moment has become enamoured of the honesty of such an unambitious part. 
<A NAME="1145"></A>For what you hold is, to speak somewhat plainly, a tyranny; to take it 
<A NAME="1146"></A>perhaps was wrong, but to let it go is unsafe. And men of these retiring 
<A NAME="1147"></A>views, making converts of others, would quickly ruin a state; indeed the 
<A NAME="1148"></A>result would be the same if they could live independent by themselves; 
<A NAME="1149"></A>for the retiring and unambitious are never secure without vigorous protectors 
<A NAME="1150"></A>at their side; in fine, such qualities are useless to an imperial city, 
<A NAME="1151"></A>though they may help a dependency to an unmolested servitude.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR><BR>"But you must not be seduced by citizens like these or angry with 
<A NAME="1153"></A>me- who, if I voted for war, only did as you did yourselves- in spite of 
<A NAME="1154"></A>the enemy having invaded your country and done what you could be certain 
<A NAME="1155"></A>that he would do, if you refused to comply with his demands; and although 
<A NAME="1156"></A>besides what we counted for, the plague has come upon us- the only point 
<A NAME="1157"></A>indeed at which our calculation has been at fault. It is this, I know, 
<A NAME="1158"></A>that has had a large share in making me more unpopular than I should otherwise 
<A NAME="1159"></A>have been- quite undeservedly, unless you are also prepared to give me 
<A NAME="1160"></A>the credit of any success with which chance may present you. Besides, the 
<A NAME="1161"></A>hand of heaven must be borne with resignation, that of the enemy with fortitude; 
<A NAME="1162"></A>this was the old way at Athens, and do not you prevent it being so still. 
<A NAME="1163"></A>Remember, too, that if your country has the greatest name in all the world, 
<A NAME="1164"></A>it is because she never bent before disaster; because she has expended 
<A NAME="1165"></A>more life and effort in war than any other city, and has won for herself 
<A NAME="1166"></A>a power greater than any hitherto known, the memory of which will descend 
<A NAME="1167"></A>to the latest posterity; even if now, in obedience to the general law of 
<A NAME="1168"></A>decay, we should ever be forced to yield, still it will be remembered that 
<A NAME="1169"></A>we held rule over more Hellenes than any other Hellenic state, that we 
<A NAME="1170"></A>sustained the greatest wars against their united or separate powers, and 
<A NAME="1171"></A>inhabited a city unrivalled by any other in resources or magnitude. These 
<A NAME="1172"></A>glories may incur the censure of the slow and unambitious; but in the breast 
<A NAME="1173"></A>of energy they will awake emulation, and in those who must remain without 
<A NAME="1174"></A>them an envious regret. Hatred and unpopularity at the moment have fallen 
<A NAME="1175"></A>to the lot of all who have aspired to rule others; but where odium must 
<A NAME="1176"></A>be incurred, true wisdom incurs it for the highest objects. Hatred also 
<A NAME="1177"></A>is short-lived; but that which makes the splendour of the present and the 
<A NAME="1178"></A>glory of the future remains for ever unforgotten. Make your decision, therefore, 
<A NAME="1179"></A>for glory then and honour now, and attain both objects by instant and zealous 
<A NAME="1180"></A>effort: do not send heralds to Lacedaemon, and do not betray any sign of 
<A NAME="1181"></A>being oppressed by your present sufferings, since they whose minds are 
<A NAME="1182"></A>least sensitive to calamity, and whose hands are most quick to meet it, 
<A NAME="1183"></A>are the greatest men and the greatest communities."
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR>Such were the arguments by which Pericles tried to cure the Athenians 
<A NAME="1185"></A>of their anger against him and to divert their thoughts from their immediate 
<A NAME="1186"></A>afflictions. As a community he succeeded in convincing them; they not only 
<A NAME="1187"></A>gave up all idea of sending to Lacedaemon, but applied themselves with 
<A NAME="1188"></A>increased energy to the war; still as private individuals they could not 
<A NAME="1189"></A>help smarting under their sufferings, the common people having been deprived 
<A NAME="1190"></A>of the little that they were possessed, while the higher orders had lost 
<A NAME="1191"></A>fine properties with costly establishments and buildings in the country, 
<A NAME="1192"></A>and, worst of all, had war instead of peace. In fact, the public feeling 
<A NAME="1193"></A>against him did not subside until he had been fined. Not long afterwards, 
<A NAME="1194"></A>however, according to the way of the multitude, they again elected him 
<A NAME="1195"></A>general and committed all their affairs to his hands, having now become 
<A NAME="1196"></A>less sensitive to their private and domestic afflictions, and understanding 
<A NAME="1197"></A>that he was the best man of all for the public necessities. For as long 
<A NAME="1198"></A>as he was at the head of the state during the peace, he pursued a moderate 
<A NAME="1199"></A>and conservative policy; and in his time its greatness was at its height. 
<A NAME="1200"></A>When the war broke out, here also he seems to have rightly gauged the power 
<A NAME="1201"></A>of his country. He outlived its commencement two years and six months, 
<A NAME="1202"></A>and the correctness of his previsions respecting it became better known 
<A NAME="1203"></A>by his death. He told them to wait quietly, to pay attention to their marine, 
<A NAME="1204"></A>to attempt no new conquests, and to expose the city to no hazards during 
<A NAME="1205"></A>the war, and doing this, promised them a favourable result. What they did 
<A NAME="1206"></A>was the very contrary, allowing private ambitions and private interests, 
<A NAME="1207"></A>in matters apparently quite foreign to the war, to lead them into projects 
<A NAME="1208"></A>unjust both to themselves and to their allies- projects whose success would 
<A NAME="1209"></A>only conduce to the honour and advantage of private persons, and whose 
<A NAME="1210"></A>failure entailed certain disaster on the country in the war. The causes 
<A NAME="1211"></A>of this are not far to seek. Pericles indeed, by his rank, ability, and 
<A NAME="1212"></A>known integrity, was enabled to exercise an independent control over the 
<A NAME="1213"></A>multitude- in short, to lead them instead of being led by them; for as 
<A NAME="1214"></A>he never sought power by improper means, he was never compelled to flatter 
<A NAME="1215"></A>them, but, on the contrary, enjoyed so high an estimation that he could 
<A NAME="1216"></A>afford to anger them by contradiction. Whenever he saw them unseasonably 
<A NAME="1217"></A>and insolently elated, he would with a word reduce them to alarm; on the 
<A NAME="1218"></A>other hand, if they fell victims to a panic, he could at once restore them 
<A NAME="1219"></A>to confidence. In short, what was nominally a democracy became in his hands 
<A NAME="1220"></A>government by the first citizen. With his successors it was different. 
<A NAME="1221"></A>More on a level with one another, and each grasping at supremacy, they 
<A NAME="1222"></A>ended by committing even the conduct of state affairs to the whims of the 
<A NAME="1223"></A>multitude. This, as might have been expected in a great and sovereign state, 
<A NAME="1224"></A>produced a host of blunders, and amongst them the Sicilian expedition; 
<A NAME="1225"></A>though this failed not so much through a miscalculation of the power of 
<A NAME="1226"></A>those against whom it was sent, as through a fault in the senders in not 
<A NAME="1227"></A>taking the best measures afterwards to assist those who had gone out, but 
<A NAME="1228"></A>choosing rather to occupy themselves with private cabals for the leadership 
<A NAME="1229"></A>of the commons, by which they not only paralysed operations in the field, 
<A NAME="1230"></A>but also first introduced civil discord at home. Yet after losing most 
<A NAME="1231"></A>of their fleet besides other forces in Sicily, and with faction already 
<A NAME="1232"></A>dominant in the city, they could still for three years make head against 
<A NAME="1233"></A>their original adversaries, joined not only by the Sicilians, but also 
<A NAME="1234"></A>by their own allies nearly all in revolt, and at last by the King's son, 
<A NAME="1235"></A>Cyrus, who furnished the funds for the Peloponnesian navy. Nor did they 
<A NAME="1236"></A>finally succumb till they fell the victims of their own intestine disorders. 
<A NAME="1237"></A>So superfluously abundant were the resources from which the genius of Pericles 
<A NAME="1238"></A>foresaw an easy triumph in the war over the unaided forces of the 
<A NAME="1239"></A>Peloponnesians.
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR><BR>During the same summer the Lacedaemonians and their allies made 
<A NAME="1241"></A>an expedition with a hundred ships against Zacynthus, an island lying off 
<A NAME="1242"></A>the coast of Elis, peopled by a colony of Achaeans from Peloponnese, and 
<A NAME="1243"></A>in alliance with Athens. There were a thousand Lacedaemonian heavy infantry 
<A NAME="1244"></A>on board, and Cnemus, a Spartan, as admiral. They made a descent from their 
<A NAME="1245"></A>ships, and ravaged most of the country; but as the inhabitants would not 
<A NAME="1246"></A>submit, they sailed back home.
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR><BR>At the end of the same summer the Corinthian Aristeus, Aneristus, 
<A NAME="1248"></A>Nicolaus, and Stratodemus, envoys from Lacedaemon, Timagoras, a Tegean, 
<A NAME="1249"></A>and a private individual named Pollis from Argos, on their way to Asia 
<A NAME="1250"></A>to persuade the King to supply funds and join in the war, came to Sitalces, 
<A NAME="1251"></A>son of Teres in Thrace, with the idea of inducing him, if possible, to 
<A NAME="1252"></A>forsake the alliance of Athens and to march on Potidaea then besieged by 
<A NAME="1253"></A>an Athenian force, and also of getting conveyed by his means to their destination 
<A NAME="1254"></A>across the Hellespont to Pharnabazus, who was to send them up the country 
<A NAME="1255"></A>to the King. But there chanced to be with Sitalces some Athenian ambassadors- 
<A NAME="1256"></A>Learchus, son of Callimachus, and Ameiniades, son of Philemon- who persuaded 
<A NAME="1257"></A>Sitalces' son, Sadocus, the new Athenian citizen, to put the men into their 
<A NAME="1258"></A>hands and thus prevent their crossing over to the King and doing their 
<A NAME="1259"></A>part to injure the country of his choice. He accordingly had them seized, 
<A NAME="1260"></A>as they were travelling through Thrace to the vessel in which they were 
<A NAME="1261"></A>to cross the Hellespont, by a party whom he had sent on with Learchus and 
<A NAME="1262"></A>Ameiniades, and gave orders for their delivery to the Athenian ambassadors, 
<A NAME="1263"></A>by whom they were brought to Athens. On their arrival, the Athenians, afraid 
<A NAME="1264"></A>that Aristeus, who had been notably the prime mover in the previous affairs 
<A NAME="1265"></A>of Potidaea and their Thracian possessions, might live to do them still 
<A NAME="1266"></A>more mischief if he escaped, slew them all the same day, without giving 
<A NAME="1267"></A>them a trial or hearing the defence which they wished to offer, and cast 
<A NAME="1268"></A>their bodies into a pit; thinking themselves justified in using in retaliation 
<A NAME="1269"></A>the same mode of warfare which the Lacedaemonians had begun, when they 
<A NAME="1270"></A>slew and cast into pits all the Athenian and allied traders whom they caught 
<A NAME="1271"></A>on board the merchantmen round Peloponnese. Indeed, at the outset of the 
<A NAME="1272"></A>war, the Lacedaemonians butchered as enemies all whom they took on the 
<A NAME="1273"></A>sea, whether allies of Athens or neutrals.
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR><BR>About the same time towards the close of the summer, the Ambraciot 
<A NAME="1275"></A>forces, with a number of barbarians that they had raised, marched against 
<A NAME="1276"></A>the Amphilochian Argos and the rest of that country. The origin of their 
<A NAME="1277"></A>enmity against the Argives was this. This Argos and the rest of Amphilochia 
<A NAME="1278"></A>were colonized by Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus. Dissatisfied with the 
<A NAME="1279"></A>state of affairs at home on his return thither after the Trojan War, he 
<A NAME="1280"></A>built this city in the Ambracian Gulf, and named it Argos after his own 
<A NAME="1281"></A>country. This was the largest town in Amphilochia, and its inhabitants 
<A NAME="1282"></A>the most powerful. Under the pressure of misfortune many generations afterwards, 
<A NAME="1283"></A>they called in the Ambraciots, their neighbours on the Amphilochian border, 
<A NAME="1284"></A>to join their colony; and it was by this union with the Ambraciots that 
<A NAME="1285"></A>they learnt their present Hellenic speech, the rest of the Amphilochians 
<A NAME="1286"></A>being barbarians. After a time the Ambraciots expelled the Argives and 
<A NAME="1287"></A>held the city themselves. Upon this the Amphilochians gave themselves over 
<A NAME="1288"></A>to the Acarnanians; and the two together called the Athenians, who sent 
<A NAME="1289"></A>them Phormio as general and thirty ships; upon whose arrival they took 
<A NAME="1290"></A>Argos by storm, and made slaves of the Ambraciots; and the Amphilochians 
<A NAME="1291"></A>and Acarnanians inhabited the town in common. After this began the alliance 
<A NAME="1292"></A>between the Athenians and Acarnanians. The enmity of the Ambraciots against 
<A NAME="1293"></A>the Argives thus commenced with the enslavement of their citizens; and 
<A NAME="1294"></A>afterwards during the war they collected this armament among themselves 
<A NAME="1295"></A>and the Chaonians, and other of the neighbouring barbarians. Arrived before 
<A NAME="1296"></A>Argos, they became masters of the country; but not being successful in 
<A NAME="1297"></A>their attacks upon the town, returned home and dispersed among their different 
<A NAME="1298"></A>peoples.
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR><BR>Such were the events of the summer. The ensuing winter the Athenians 
<A NAME="1300"></A>sent twenty ships round Peloponnese, under the command of Phormio, who 
<A NAME="1301"></A>stationed himself at Naupactus and kept watch against any one sailing in 
<A NAME="1302"></A>or out of Corinth and the Crissaean Gulf. Six others went to Caria and 
<A NAME="1303"></A>Lycia under Melesander, to collect tribute in those parts, and also to 
<A NAME="1304"></A>prevent the Peloponnesian privateers from taking up their station in those 
<A NAME="1305"></A>waters and molesting the passage of the merchantmen from Phaselis and Phoenicia 
<A NAME="1306"></A>and the adjoining continent. However, Melesander, going up the country 
<A NAME="1307"></A>into Lycia with a force of Athenians from the ships and the allies, was 
<A NAME="1308"></A>defeated and killed in battle, with the loss of a number of his 
<A NAME="1309"></A>troops.
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR><BR>The same winter the Potidaeans at length found themselves no longer 
<A NAME="1311"></A>able to hold out against their besiegers. The inroads of the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="1312"></A>into Attica had not had the desired effect of making the Athenians raise 
<A NAME="1313"></A>the siege. Provisions there were none left; and so far had distress for 
<A NAME="1314"></A>food gone in Potidaea that, besides a number of other horrors, instances 
<A NAME="1315"></A>had even occurred of the people having eaten one another. in this extremity 
<A NAME="1316"></A>they at last made proposals for capitulating to the Athenian generals in 
<A NAME="1317"></A>command against them- Xenophon, son of Euripides, Hestiodorus, son of Aristocleides, 
<A NAME="1318"></A>and Phanomachus, son of Callimachus. The generals accepted their proposals, 
<A NAME="1319"></A>seeing the sufferings of the army in so exposed a position; besides which 
<A NAME="1320"></A>the state had already spent two thousand talents upon the siege. The terms 
<A NAME="1321"></A>of the capitulation were as follows: a free passage out for themselves, 
<A NAME="1322"></A>their children, wives and auxiliaries, with one garment apiece, the women 
<A NAME="1323"></A>with two, and a fixed sum of money for their journey. Under this treaty 
<A NAME="1324"></A>they went out to Chalcidice and other places, according as was their power. 
<A NAME="1325"></A>The Athenians, however, blamed the generals for granting terms without 
<A NAME="1326"></A>instructions from home, being of opinion that the place would have had 
<A NAME="1327"></A>to surrender at discretion. They afterwards sent settlers of their own 
<A NAME="1328"></A>to Potidaea, and colonized it. Such were the events of the winter, and 
<A NAME="1329"></A>so ended the second year of this war of which Thucydides was the 
<A NAME="1330"></A>historian.

<A NAME="1332"></A><BR><BR><B>Third Year of the War - Investment of Plataea -</B> <B>Naval 
<A NAME="1333"></A>Victories of Phormio - Thracian</B> <B>Irruption into Macedonia under 
<A NAME="1334"></A>Sitalces</B>
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR><BR>The next summer the Peloponnesians and their allies, instead of 
<A NAME="1336"></A>invading Attica, marched against Plataea, under the command of Archidamus, 
<A NAME="1337"></A>son of Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians. He had encamped his army 
<A NAME="1338"></A>and was about to lay waste the country, when the Plataeans hastened to 
<A NAME="1339"></A>send envoys to him, and spoke as follows: "Archidamus and Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="1340"></A>in invading the Plataean territory, you do what is wrong in itself, and 
<A NAME="1341"></A>worthy neither of yourselves nor of the fathers who begot you. Pausanias, 
<A NAME="1342"></A>son of Cleombrotus, your countryman, after freeing Hellas from the Medes 
<A NAME="1343"></A>with the help of those Hellenes who were willing to undertake the risk 
<A NAME="1344"></A>of the battle fought near our city, offered sacrifice to Zeus the Liberator 
<A NAME="1345"></A>in the marketplace of Plataea, and calling all the allies together restored 
<A NAME="1346"></A>to the Plataeans their city and territory, and declared it independent 
<A NAME="1347"></A>and inviolate against aggression or conquest. Should any such be attempted, 
<A NAME="1348"></A>the allies present were to help according to their power. Your fathers 
<A NAME="1349"></A>rewarded us thus for the courage and patriotism that we displayed at that 
<A NAME="1350"></A>perilous epoch; but you do just the contrary, coming with our bitterest 
<A NAME="1351"></A>enemies, the Thebans, to enslave us. We appeal, therefore, to the gods 
<A NAME="1352"></A>to whom the oaths were then made, to the gods of your ancestors, and lastly 
<A NAME="1353"></A>to those of our country, and call upon you to refrain from violating our 
<A NAME="1354"></A>territory or transgressing the oaths, and to let us live independent, as 
<A NAME="1355"></A>Pausanias decreed."
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR><BR>The Plataeans had got thus far when they were cut short by Archidamus 
<A NAME="1357"></A>saying: "There is justice, Plataeans, in what you say, if you act up to 
<A NAME="1358"></A>your words. According, to the grant of Pausanias, continue to be independent 
<A NAME="1359"></A>yourselves, and join in freeing those of your fellow countrymen who, after 
<A NAME="1360"></A>sharing in the perils of that period, joined in the oaths to you, and are 
<A NAME="1361"></A>now subject to the Athenians; for it is to free them and the rest that 
<A NAME="1362"></A>all this provision and war has been made. I could wish that you would share 
<A NAME="1363"></A>our labours and abide by the oaths yourselves; if this is impossible, do 
<A NAME="1364"></A>what we have already required of you- remain neutral, enjoying your own; 
<A NAME="1365"></A>join neither side, but receive both as friends, neither as allies for the 
<A NAME="1366"></A>war. With this we shall be satisfied." Such were the words of Archidamus. 
<A NAME="1367"></A>The Plataeans, after hearing what he had to say, went into the city and 
<A NAME="1368"></A>acquainted the people with what had passed, and presently returned for 
<A NAME="1369"></A>answer that it was impossible for them to do what he proposed without consulting 
<A NAME="1370"></A>the Athenians, with whom their children and wives now were; besides which 
<A NAME="1371"></A>they had their fears for the town. After his departure, what was to prevent 
<A NAME="1372"></A>the Athenians from coming and taking it out of their hands, or the Thebans, 
<A NAME="1373"></A>who would be included in the oaths, from taking advantage of the proposed 
<A NAME="1374"></A>neutrality to make a second attempt to seize the city? Upon these points 
<A NAME="1375"></A>he tried to reassure them by saying: "You have only to deliver over the 
<A NAME="1376"></A>city and houses to us Lacedaemonians, to point out the boundaries of your 
<A NAME="1377"></A>land, the number of your fruit-trees, and whatever else can be numerically 
<A NAME="1378"></A>stated, and yourselves to withdraw wherever you like as long as the war 
<A NAME="1379"></A>shall last. When it is over we will restore to you whatever we received, 
<A NAME="1380"></A>and in the interim hold it in trust and keep it in cultivation, paying 
<A NAME="1381"></A>you a sufficient allowance."
<A NAME="1382"></A><BR><BR>When they had heard what he had to say, they re-entered the city, 
<A NAME="1383"></A>and after consulting with the people said that they wished first to acquaint 
<A NAME="1384"></A>the Athenians with this proposal, and in the event of their approving to 
<A NAME="1385"></A>accede to it; in the meantime they asked him to grant them a truce and 
<A NAME="1386"></A>not to lay waste their territory. He accordingly granted a truce for the 
<A NAME="1387"></A>number of days requisite for the journey, and meanwhile abstained from 
<A NAME="1388"></A>ravaging their territory. The Plataean envoys went to Athens, and consulted 
<A NAME="1389"></A>with the Athenians, and returned with the following message to those in 
<A NAME="1390"></A>the city: "The Athenians say, Plataeans, that they never hitherto, since 
<A NAME="1391"></A>we became their allies, on any occasion abandoned us to an enemy, nor will 
<A NAME="1392"></A>they now neglect us, but will help us according to their ability; and they 
<A NAME="1393"></A>adjure you by the oaths which your fathers swore, to keep the alliance 
<A NAME="1394"></A>unaltered."
<A NAME="1395"></A><BR><BR>On the delivery of this message by the envoys, the Plataeans resolved 
<A NAME="1396"></A>not to be unfaithful to the Athenians but to endure, if it must be, seeing 
<A NAME="1397"></A>their lands laid waste and any other trials that might come to them, and 
<A NAME="1398"></A>not to send out again, but to answer from the wall that it was impossible 
<A NAME="1399"></A>for them to do as the Lacedaemonians proposed. As soon as he had received 
<A NAME="1400"></A>this answer, King Archidamus proceeded first to make a solemn appeal to 
<A NAME="1401"></A>the gods and heroes of the country in words following: "Ye gods and heroes 
<A NAME="1402"></A>of the Plataean territory, be my witnesses that not as aggressors originally, 
<A NAME="1403"></A>nor until these had first departed from the common oath, did we invade 
<A NAME="1404"></A>this land, in which our fathers offered you their prayers before defeating 
<A NAME="1405"></A>the Medes, and which you made auspicious to the Hellenic arms; nor shall 
<A NAME="1406"></A>we be aggressors in the measures to which we may now resort, since we have 
<A NAME="1407"></A>made many fair proposals but have not been successful. Graciously accord 
<A NAME="1408"></A>that those who were the first to offend may be punished for it, and that 
<A NAME="1409"></A>vengeance may be attained by those who would righteously inflict 
<A NAME="1410"></A>it."
<A NAME="1411"></A><BR><BR>After this appeal to the gods Archidamus put his army in motion. 
<A NAME="1412"></A>First he enclosed the town with a palisade formed of the fruit-trees which 
<A NAME="1413"></A>they cut down, to prevent further egress from Plataea; next they threw 
<A NAME="1414"></A>up a mound against the city, hoping that the largeness of the force employed 
<A NAME="1415"></A>would ensure the speedy reduction of the place. They accordingly cut down 
<A NAME="1416"></A>timber from Cithaeron, and built it up on either side, laying it like lattice-work 
<A NAME="1417"></A>to serve as a wall to keep the mound from spreading abroad, and carried 
<A NAME="1418"></A>to it wood and stones and earth and whatever other material might help 
<A NAME="1419"></A>to complete it. They continued to work at the mound for seventy days and 
<A NAME="1420"></A>nights without intermission, being divided into relief parties to allow 
<A NAME="1421"></A>of some being employed in carrying while others took sleep and refreshment; 
<A NAME="1422"></A>the Lacedaemonian officer attached to each contingent keeping the men to 
<A NAME="1423"></A>the work. But the Plataeans, observing the progress of the mound, constructed 
<A NAME="1424"></A>a wall of wood and fixed it upon that part of the city wall against which 
<A NAME="1425"></A>the mound was being erected, and built up bricks inside it which they took 
<A NAME="1426"></A>from the neighbouring houses. The timbers served to bind the building together, 
<A NAME="1427"></A>and to prevent its becoming weak as it advanced in height; it had also 
<A NAME="1428"></A>a covering of skins and hides, which protected the woodwork against the 
<A NAME="1429"></A>attacks of burning missiles and allowed the men to work in safety. Thus 
<A NAME="1430"></A>the wall was raised to a great height, and the mound opposite made no less 
<A NAME="1431"></A>rapid progress. The Plataeans also thought of another expedient; they pulled 
<A NAME="1432"></A>out part of the wall upon which the mound abutted, and carried the earth 
<A NAME="1433"></A>into the city.
<A NAME="1434"></A><BR><BR>Discovering this the Peloponnesians twisted up clay in wattles 
<A NAME="1435"></A>of reed and threw it into the breach formed in the mound, in order to give 
<A NAME="1436"></A>it consistency and prevent its being carried away like the soil. Stopped 
<A NAME="1437"></A>in this way the Plataeans changed their mode of operation, and digging 
<A NAME="1438"></A>a mine from the town calculated their way under the mound, and began to 
<A NAME="1439"></A>carry off its material as before. This went on for a long while without 
<A NAME="1440"></A>the enemy outside finding it out, so that for all they threw on the top 
<A NAME="1441"></A>their mound made no progress in proportion, being carried away from beneath 
<A NAME="1442"></A>and constantly settling down in the vacuum. But the Plataeans, fearing 
<A NAME="1443"></A>that even thus they might not be able to hold out against the superior 
<A NAME="1444"></A>numbers of the enemy, had yet another invention. They stopped working at 
<A NAME="1445"></A>the large building in front of the mound, and starting at either end of 
<A NAME="1446"></A>it inside from the old low wall, built a new one in the form of a crescent 
<A NAME="1447"></A>running in towards the town; in order that in the event of the great wall 
<A NAME="1448"></A>being taken this might remain, and the enemy have to throw up a fresh mound 
<A NAME="1449"></A>against it, and as they advanced within might not only have their trouble 
<A NAME="1450"></A>over again, but also be exposed to missiles on their flanks. While raising 
<A NAME="1451"></A>the mound the Peloponnesians also brought up engines against the city, 
<A NAME="1452"></A>one of which was brought up upon the mound against the great building and 
<A NAME="1453"></A>shook down a good piece of it, to the no small alarm of the Plataeans. 
<A NAME="1454"></A>Others were advanced against different parts of the wall but were lassoed 
<A NAME="1455"></A>and broken by the Plataeans; who also hung up great beams by long iron 
<A NAME="1456"></A>chains from either extremity of two poles laid on the wall and projecting 
<A NAME="1457"></A>over it, and drew them up at an angle whenever any point was threatened 
<A NAME="1458"></A>by the engine, and loosing their hold let the beam go with its chains slack, 
<A NAME="1459"></A>so that it fell with a run and snapped off the nose of the battering 
<A NAME="1460"></A>ram.
<A NAME="1461"></A><BR><BR>After this the Peloponnesians, finding that their engines effected 
<A NAME="1462"></A>nothing, and that their mound was met by the counterwork, concluded that 
<A NAME="1463"></A>their present means of offence were unequal to the taking of the city, 
<A NAME="1464"></A>and prepared for its circumvallation. First, however, they determined to 
<A NAME="1465"></A>try the effects of fire and see whether they could not, with the help of 
<A NAME="1466"></A>a wind, burn the town, as it was not a large one; indeed they thought of 
<A NAME="1467"></A>every possible expedient by which the place might be reduced without the 
<A NAME="1468"></A>expense of a blockade. They accordingly brought faggots of brushwood and 
<A NAME="1469"></A>threw them from the mound, first into the space between it and the wall; 
<A NAME="1470"></A>and this soon becoming full from the number of hands at work, they next 
<A NAME="1471"></A>heaped the faggots up as far into the town as they could reach from the 
<A NAME="1472"></A>top, and then lighted the wood by setting fire to it with sulphur and pitch. 
<A NAME="1473"></A>The consequence was a fire greater than any one had ever yet seen produced 
<A NAME="1474"></A>by human agency, though it could not of course be compared to the spontaneous 
<A NAME="1475"></A>conflagrations sometimes known to occur through the wind rubbing the branches 
<A NAME="1476"></A>of a mountain forest together. And this fire was not only remarkable for 
<A NAME="1477"></A>its magnitude, but was also, at the end of so many perils, within an ace 
<A NAME="1478"></A>of proving fatal to the Plataeans; a great part of the town became entirely 
<A NAME="1479"></A>inaccessible, and had a wind blown upon it, in accordance with the hopes 
<A NAME="1480"></A>of the enemy, nothing could have saved them. As it was, there is also a 
<A NAME="1481"></A>story of heavy rain and thunder having come on by which the fire was put 
<A NAME="1482"></A>out and the danger averted.
<A NAME="1483"></A><BR><BR>Failing in this last attempt the Peloponnesians left a portion 
<A NAME="1484"></A>of their forces on the spot, dismissing the rest, and built a wall of circumvallation 
<A NAME="1485"></A>round the town, dividing the ground among the various cities present; a 
<A NAME="1486"></A>ditch being made within and without the lines, from which they got their 
<A NAME="1487"></A>bricks. All being finished by about the rising of Arcturus, they left men 
<A NAME="1488"></A>enough to man half the wall, the rest being manned by the Boeotians, and 
<A NAME="1489"></A>drawing off their army dispersed to their several cities. The Plataeans 
<A NAME="1490"></A>had before sent off their wives and children and oldest men and the mass 
<A NAME="1491"></A>of the non-combatants to Athens; so that the number of the besieged left 
<A NAME="1492"></A>in the place comprised four hundred of their own citizens, eighty Athenians, 
<A NAME="1493"></A>and a hundred and ten women to bake their bread. This was the sum total 
<A NAME="1494"></A>at the commencement of the siege, and there was no one else within the 
<A NAME="1495"></A>walls, bond or free. Such were the arrangements made for the blockade of 
<A NAME="1496"></A>Plataea.
<A NAME="1497"></A><BR><BR>The same summer and simultaneously with the expedition against 
<A NAME="1498"></A>Plataea, the Athenians marched with two thousand heavy infantry and two 
<A NAME="1499"></A>hundred horse against the Chalcidians in the direction of Thrace and the 
<A NAME="1500"></A>Bottiaeans, just as the corn was getting ripe, under the command of Xenophon, 
<A NAME="1501"></A>son of Euripides, with two colleagues. Arriving before Spartolus in Bottiaea, 
<A NAME="1502"></A>they destroyed the corn and had some hopes of the city coming over through 
<A NAME="1503"></A>the intrigues of a faction within. But those of a different way of thinking 
<A NAME="1504"></A>had sent to Olynthus; and a garrison of heavy infantry and other troops 
<A NAME="1505"></A>arrived accordingly. These issuing from Spartolus were engaged by the Athenians 
<A NAME="1506"></A>in front of the town: the Chalcidian heavy infantry, and some auxiliaries 
<A NAME="1507"></A>with them, were beaten and retreated into Spartolus; but the Chalcidian 
<A NAME="1508"></A>horse and light troops defeated the horse and light troops of the Athenians. 
<A NAME="1509"></A>The Chalcidians had already a few targeteers from Crusis, and presently 
<A NAME="1510"></A>after the battle were joined by some others from Olynthus; upon seeing 
<A NAME="1511"></A>whom the light troops from Spartolus, emboldened by this accession and 
<A NAME="1512"></A>by their previous success, with the help of the Chalcidian horse and the 
<A NAME="1513"></A>reinforcement just arrived again attacked the Athenians, who retired upon 
<A NAME="1514"></A>the two divisions which they had left with their baggage. Whenever the 
<A NAME="1515"></A>Athenians advanced, their adversary gave way, pressing them with missiles 
<A NAME="1516"></A>the instant they began to retire. The Chalcidian horse also, riding up 
<A NAME="1517"></A>and charging them just as they pleased, at last caused a panic amongst 
<A NAME="1518"></A>them and routed and pursued them to a great distance. The Athenians took 
<A NAME="1519"></A>refuge in Potidaea, and afterwards recovered their dead under truce, and 
<A NAME="1520"></A>returned to Athens with the remnant of their army; four hundred and thirty 
<A NAME="1521"></A>men and all the generals having fallen. The Chalcidians and Bottiaeans 
<A NAME="1522"></A>set up a trophy, took up their dead, and dispersed to their several 
<A NAME="1523"></A>cities.
<A NAME="1524"></A><BR><BR>The same summer, not long after this, the Ambraciots and Chaonians, 
<A NAME="1525"></A>being desirous of reducing the whole of Acarnania and detaching it from 
<A NAME="1526"></A>Athens, persuaded the Lacedaemonians to equip a fleet from their confederacy 
<A NAME="1527"></A>and send a thousand heavy infantry to Acarnania, representing that, if 
<A NAME="1528"></A>a combined movement were made by land and sea, the coast Acarnanians would 
<A NAME="1529"></A>be unable to march, and the conquest of Zacynthus and Cephallenia easily 
<A NAME="1530"></A>following on the possession of Acarnania, the cruise round Peloponnese 
<A NAME="1531"></A>would be no longer so convenient for the Athenians. Besides which there 
<A NAME="1532"></A>was a hope of taking Naupactus. The Lacedaemonians accordingly at once 
<A NAME="1533"></A>sent off a few vessels with Cnemus, who was still high admiral, and the 
<A NAME="1534"></A>heavy infantry on board; and sent round orders for the fleet to equip as 
<A NAME="1535"></A>quickly as possible and sail to Leucas. The Corinthians were the most forward 
<A NAME="1536"></A>in the business; the Ambraciots being a colony of theirs. While the ships 
<A NAME="1537"></A>from Corinth, Sicyon, and the neighbourhood were getting ready, and those 
<A NAME="1538"></A>from Leucas, Anactorium, and Ambracia, which had arrived before, were walting 
<A NAME="1539"></A>for them at Leucas, Cnemus and his thousand heavy infantry had run into 
<A NAME="1540"></A>the gulf, giving the slip to Phormio, the commander of the Athenian squadron 
<A NAME="1541"></A>stationed off Naupactus, and began at once to prepare for the land expedition. 
<A NAME="1542"></A>The Hellenic troops with him consisted of the Ambraciots, Leucadians, and 
<A NAME="1543"></A>Anactorians, and the thousand Peloponnesians with whom he came; the barbarian 
<A NAME="1544"></A>of a thousand Chaonians, who, belonging to a nation that has no king, were 
<A NAME="1545"></A>led by Photys and Nicanor, the two members of the royal family to whom 
<A NAME="1546"></A>the chieftainship for that year had been confided. With the Chaonians came 
<A NAME="1547"></A>also some Thesprotians, like them without a king, some Molossians and Atintanians 
<A NAME="1548"></A>led by Sabylinthus, the guardian of King Tharyps who was still a minor, 
<A NAME="1549"></A>and some Paravaeans, under their king Oroedus, accompanied by a thousand 
<A NAME="1550"></A>Orestians, subjects of King Antichus and placed by him under the command 
<A NAME="1551"></A>of Oroedus. There were also a thousand Macedonians sent by Perdiccas without 
<A NAME="1552"></A>the knowledge of the Athenians, but they arrived too late. With this force 
<A NAME="1553"></A>Cnemus set out, without waiting for the fleet from Corinth. Passing through 
<A NAME="1554"></A>the territory of Amphilochian Argos, and sacking the open village of Limnaea, 
<A NAME="1555"></A>they advanced to Stratus the Acarnanian capital; this once taken, the rest 
<A NAME="1556"></A>of the country, they felt convinced, would speedily 
<A NAME="1557"></A>follow.
<A NAME="1558"></A><BR><BR>The Acarnanians, finding themselves invaded by a large army by 
<A NAME="1559"></A>land, and from the sea threatened by a hostile fleet, made no combined 
<A NAME="1560"></A>attempt at resistance, but remained to defend their homes, and sent for 
<A NAME="1561"></A>help to Phormio, who replied that, when a fleet was on the point of sailing 
<A NAME="1562"></A>from Corinth, it was impossible for him to leave Naupactus unprotected. 
<A NAME="1563"></A>The Peloponnesians meanwhile and their allies advanced upon Stratus in 
<A NAME="1564"></A>three divisions, with the intention of encamping near it and attempting 
<A NAME="1565"></A>the wall by force if they failed to succeed by negotiation. The order of 
<A NAME="1566"></A>march was as follows: the centre was occupied by the Chaonians and the 
<A NAME="1567"></A>rest of the barbarians, with the Leucadians and Anactorians and their followers 
<A NAME="1568"></A>on the right, and Cnemus with the Peloponnesians and Ambraciots on the 
<A NAME="1569"></A>left; each division being a long way off from, and sometimes even out of 
<A NAME="1570"></A>sight of, the others. The Hellenes advanced in good order, keeping a look-out 
<A NAME="1571"></A>till they encamped in a good position; but the Chaonians, filled with self-confidence, 
<A NAME="1572"></A>and having the highest character for courage among the tribes of that part 
<A NAME="1573"></A>of the continent, without waiting to occupy their camp, rushed on with 
<A NAME="1574"></A>the rest of the barbarians, in the idea that they should take the town 
<A NAME="1575"></A>by assault and obtain the sole glory of the enterprise. While they were 
<A NAME="1576"></A>coming on, the Stratians, becoming aware how things stood, and thinking 
<A NAME="1577"></A>that the defeat of this division would considerably dishearten the Hellenes 
<A NAME="1578"></A>behind it, occupied the environs of the town with ambuscades, and as soon 
<A NAME="1579"></A>as they approached engaged them at close quarters from the city and the 
<A NAME="1580"></A>ambuscades. A panic seizing the Chaonians, great numbers of them were slain; 
<A NAME="1581"></A>and as soon as they were seen to give way the rest of the barbarians turned 
<A NAME="1582"></A>and fled. Owing to the distance by which their allies had preceded them, 
<A NAME="1583"></A>neither of the Hellenic divisions knew anything of the battle, but fancied 
<A NAME="1584"></A>they were hastening on to encamp. However, when the flying barbarians broke 
<A NAME="1585"></A>in upon them, they opened their ranks to receive them, brought their divisions 
<A NAME="1586"></A>together, and stopped quiet where they were for the day; the Stratians 
<A NAME="1587"></A>not offering to engage them, as the rest of the Acarnanians had not yet 
<A NAME="1588"></A>arrived, but contenting themselves with slinging at them from a distance, 
<A NAME="1589"></A>which distressed them greatly, as there was no stirring without their armour. 
<A NAME="1590"></A>The Acarnanians would seem to excel in this mode of 
<A NAME="1591"></A>warfare.
<A NAME="1592"></A><BR><BR>As soon as night fell, Cnemus hastily drew off his army to the 
<A NAME="1593"></A>river Anapus, about nine miles from Stratus, recovering his dead next day 
<A NAME="1594"></A>under truce, and being there joined by the friendly Oeniadae, fell back 
<A NAME="1595"></A>upon their city before the enemy's reinforcements came up. From hence each 
<A NAME="1596"></A>returned home; and the Stratians set up a trophy for the battle with the 
<A NAME="1597"></A>barbarians.
<A NAME="1598"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the fleet from Corinth and the rest of the confederates 
<A NAME="1599"></A>in the Crissaean Gulf, which was to have co-operated with Cnemus and prevented 
<A NAME="1600"></A>the coast Acarnanians from joining their countrymen in the interior, was 
<A NAME="1601"></A>disabled from doing so by being compelled about the same time as the battle 
<A NAME="1602"></A>at Stratus to fight with Phormio and the twenty Athenian vessels stationed 
<A NAME="1603"></A>at Naupactus. For they were watched, as they coasted along out of the gulf, 
<A NAME="1604"></A>by Phormio, who wished to attack in the open sea. But the Corinthians and 
<A NAME="1605"></A>allies had started for Acarnania without any idea of fighting at sea, and 
<A NAME="1606"></A>with vessels more like transports for carrying soldiers; besides which, 
<A NAME="1607"></A>they never dreamed of the twenty Athenian ships venturing to engage their 
<A NAME="1608"></A>forty-seven. However, while they were coasting along their own shore, there 
<A NAME="1609"></A>were the Athenians sailing along in line with them; and when they tried 
<A NAME="1610"></A>to cross over from Patrae in Achaea to the mainland on the other side, 
<A NAME="1611"></A>on their way to Acarnania, they saw them again coming out from Chalcis 
<A NAME="1612"></A>and the river Evenus to meet them. They slipped from their moorings in 
<A NAME="1613"></A>the night, but were observed, and were at length compelled to fight in 
<A NAME="1614"></A>mid passage. Each state that contributed to the armament had its own general; 
<A NAME="1615"></A>the Corinthian commanders were Machaon, Isocrates, and Agatharchidas. The 
<A NAME="1616"></A>Peloponnesians ranged their vessels in as large a circle as possible without 
<A NAME="1617"></A>leaving an opening, with the prows outside and the sterns in; and placed 
<A NAME="1618"></A>within all the small craft in company, and their five best sailers to issue 
<A NAME="1619"></A>out at a moment's notice and strengthen any point threatened by the 
<A NAME="1620"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="1621"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians, formed in line, sailed round and round them, and 
<A NAME="1622"></A>forced them to contract their circle, by continually brushing past and 
<A NAME="1623"></A>making as though they would attack at once, having been previously cautioned 
<A NAME="1624"></A>by Phormio not to do so till he gave the signal. His hope was that the 
<A NAME="1625"></A>Peloponnesians would not retain their order like a force on shore, but 
<A NAME="1626"></A>that the ships would fall foul of one another and the small craft cause 
<A NAME="1627"></A>confusion; and if the wind should blow from the gulf (in expectation of 
<A NAME="1628"></A>which he kept sailing round them, and which usually rose towards morning), 
<A NAME="1629"></A>they would not, he felt sure, remain steady an instant. He also thought 
<A NAME="1630"></A>that it rested with him to attack when he pleased, as his ships were better 
<A NAME="1631"></A>sailers, and that an attack timed by the coming of the wind would tell 
<A NAME="1632"></A>best. When the wind came down, the enemy's ships were now in a narrow space, 
<A NAME="1633"></A>and what with the wind and the small craft dashing against them, at once 
<A NAME="1634"></A>fell into confusion: ship fell foul of ship, while the crews were pushing 
<A NAME="1635"></A>them off with poles, and by their shouting, swearing, and struggling with 
<A NAME="1636"></A>one another, made captains' orders and boatswains' cries alike inaudible, 
<A NAME="1637"></A>and through being unable for want of practice to clear their oars in the 
<A NAME="1638"></A>rough water, prevented the vessels from obeying their helmsmen properly. 
<A NAME="1639"></A>At this moment Phormio gave the signal, and the Athenians attacked. Sinking 
<A NAME="1640"></A>first one of the admirals, they then disabled all they came across, so 
<A NAME="1641"></A>that no one thought of resistance for the confusion, but fled for Patrae 
<A NAME="1642"></A>and Dyme in Achaea. The Athenians gave chase and captured twelve ships, 
<A NAME="1643"></A>and taking most of the men out of them sailed to Molycrium, and after setting 
<A NAME="1644"></A>up a trophy on the promontory of Rhium and dedicating a ship to Poseidon, 
<A NAME="1645"></A>returned to Naupactus. As for the Peloponnesians, they at once sailed with 
<A NAME="1646"></A>their remaining ships along the coast from Dyme and Patrae to Cyllene, 
<A NAME="1647"></A>the Eleian arsenal; where Cnemus, and the ships from Leucas that were to 
<A NAME="1648"></A>have joined them, also arrived after the battle at Stratus.
<A NAME="1649"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians now sent to the fleet to Cnemus three commissioners- 
<A NAME="1650"></A>Timocrates, Bradidas, and Lycophron- with orders to prepare to engage again 
<A NAME="1651"></A>with better fortune, and not to be driven from the sea by a few vessels; 
<A NAME="1652"></A>for they could not at all account for their discomfiture, the less so as 
<A NAME="1653"></A>it was their first attempt at sea; and they fancied that it was not that 
<A NAME="1654"></A>their marine was so inferior, but that there had been misconduct somewhere, 
<A NAME="1655"></A>not considering the long experience of the Athenians as compared with the 
<A NAME="1656"></A>little practice which they had had themselves. The commissioners were accordingly 
<A NAME="1657"></A>sent in anger. As soon as they arrived they set to work with Cnemus to 
<A NAME="1658"></A>order ships from the different states, and to put those which they already 
<A NAME="1659"></A>had in fighting order. Meanwhile Phormio sent word to Athens of their preparations 
<A NAME="1660"></A>and his own victory, and desired as many ships as possible to be speedily 
<A NAME="1661"></A>sent to him, as he stood in daily expectation of a battle. Twenty were 
<A NAME="1662"></A>accordingly sent, but instructions were given to their commander to go 
<A NAME="1663"></A>first to Crete. For Nicias, a Cretan of Gortys, who was proxenus of the 
<A NAME="1664"></A>Athenians, had persuaded them to sail against Cydonia, promising to procure 
<A NAME="1665"></A>the reduction of that hostile town; his real wish being to oblige the Polichnitans, 
<A NAME="1666"></A>neighbours of the Cydonians. He accordingly went with the ships to Crete, 
<A NAME="1667"></A>and, accompanied by the Polichnitans, laid waste the lands of the Cydonians; 
<A NAME="1668"></A>and, what with adverse winds and stress of weather wasted no little time 
<A NAME="1669"></A>there.
<A NAME="1670"></A><BR><BR>While the Athenians were thus detained in Crete, the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="1671"></A>in Cyllene got ready for battle, and coasted along to Panormus in Achaea, 
<A NAME="1672"></A>where their land army had come to support them. Phormio also coasted along 
<A NAME="1673"></A>to Molycrian Rhium, and anchored outside it with twenty ships, the same 
<A NAME="1674"></A>as he had fought with before. This Rhium was friendly to the Athenians. 
<A NAME="1675"></A>The other, in Peloponnese, lies opposite to it; the sea between them is 
<A NAME="1676"></A>about three-quarters of a mile broad, and forms the mouth of the Crissaean 
<A NAME="1677"></A>gulf. At this, the Achaean Rhium, not far off Panormus, where their army 
<A NAME="1678"></A>lay, the Peloponnesians now cast anchor with seventy-seven ships, when 
<A NAME="1679"></A>they saw the Athenians do so. For six or seven days they remained opposite 
<A NAME="1680"></A>each other, practising and preparing for the battle; the one resolved not 
<A NAME="1681"></A>to sail out of the Rhia into the open sea, for fear of the disaster which 
<A NAME="1682"></A>had already happened to them, the other not to sail into the straits, thinking 
<A NAME="1683"></A>it advantageous to the enemy, to fight in the narrows. At last Cnemus and 
<A NAME="1684"></A>Brasidas and the rest of the Peloponnesian commanders, being desirous of 
<A NAME="1685"></A>bringing on a battle as soon as possible, before reinforcements should 
<A NAME="1686"></A>arrive from Athens, and noticing that the men were most of them cowed by 
<A NAME="1687"></A>the previous defeat and out of heart for the business, first called them 
<A NAME="1688"></A>together and encouraged them as follows:
<A NAME="1689"></A><BR><BR>"Peloponnesians, the late engagement, which may have made some 
<A NAME="1690"></A>of you afraid of the one now in prospect, really gives no just ground for 
<A NAME="1691"></A>apprehension. Preparation for it, as you know, there was little enough; 
<A NAME="1692"></A>and the object of our voyage was not so much to fight at sea as an expedition 
<A NAME="1693"></A>by land. Besides this, the chances of war were largely against us; and 
<A NAME="1694"></A>perhaps also inexperience had something to do with our failure in our first 
<A NAME="1695"></A>naval action. It was not, therefore, cowardice that produced our defeat, 
<A NAME="1696"></A>nor ought the determination which force has not quelled, but which still 
<A NAME="1697"></A>has a word to say with its adversary, to lose its edge from the result 
<A NAME="1698"></A>of an accident; but admitting the possibility of a chance miscarriage, 
<A NAME="1699"></A>we should know that brave hearts must be always brave, and while they remain 
<A NAME="1700"></A>so can never put forward inexperience as an excuse for misconduct. Nor 
<A NAME="1701"></A>are you so behind the enemy in experience as you are ahead of him in courage; 
<A NAME="1702"></A>and although the science of your opponents would, if valour accompanied 
<A NAME="1703"></A>it, have also the presence of mind to carry out at in emergency the lesson 
<A NAME="1704"></A>it has learnt, yet a faint heart will make all art powerless in the face 
<A NAME="1705"></A>of danger. For fear takes away presence of mind, and without valour art 
<A NAME="1706"></A>is useless. Against their superior experience set your superior daring, 
<A NAME="1707"></A>and against the fear induced by defeat the fact of your having been then 
<A NAME="1708"></A>unprepared; remember, too, that you have always the advantage of superior 
<A NAME="1709"></A>numbers, and of engaging off your own coast, supported by your heavy infantry; 
<A NAME="1710"></A>and as a rule, numbers and equipment give victory. At no point, therefore, 
<A NAME="1711"></A>is defeat likely; and as for our previous mistakes, the very fact of their 
<A NAME="1712"></A>occurrence will teach us better for the future. Steersmen and sailors may, 
<A NAME="1713"></A>therefore, confidently attend to their several duties, none quitting the 
<A NAME="1714"></A>station assigned to them: as for ourselves, we promise to prepare for the 
<A NAME="1715"></A>engagement at least as well as your previous commanders, and to give no 
<A NAME="1716"></A>excuse for any one misconducting himself. Should any insist on doing so, 
<A NAME="1717"></A>he shall meet with the punishment he deserves, while the brave shall be 
<A NAME="1718"></A>honoured with the appropriate rewards of valour."
<A NAME="1719"></A><BR><BR>The Peloponnesian commanders encouraged their men after this fashion. 
<A NAME="1720"></A>Phormio, meanwhile, being himself not without fears for the courage of 
<A NAME="1721"></A>his men, and noticing that they were forming in groups among themselves 
<A NAME="1722"></A>and were alarmed at the odds against them, desired to call them together 
<A NAME="1723"></A>and give them confidence and counsel in the present emergency. He had before 
<A NAME="1724"></A>continually told them, and had accustomed their minds to the idea, that 
<A NAME="1725"></A>there was no numerical superiority that they could not face; and the men 
<A NAME="1726"></A>themselves had long been persuaded that Athenians need never retire before 
<A NAME="1727"></A>any quantity of Peloponnesian vessels. At the moment, however, he saw that 
<A NAME="1728"></A>they were dispirited by the sight before them, and wishing to refresh their 
<A NAME="1729"></A>confidence, called them together and spoke as follows:
<A NAME="1730"></A><BR><BR>"I see, my men, that you are frightened by the number of the enemy, 
<A NAME="1731"></A>and I have accordingly called you together, not liking you to be afraid 
<A NAME="1732"></A>of what is not really terrible. In the first place, the Peloponnesians, 
<A NAME="1733"></A>already defeated, and not even themselves thinking that they are a match 
<A NAME="1734"></A>for us, have not ventured to meet us on equal terms, but have equipped 
<A NAME="1735"></A>this multitude of ships against us. Next, as to that upon which they most 
<A NAME="1736"></A>rely, the courage which they suppose constitutional to them, their confidence 
<A NAME="1737"></A>here only arises from the success which their experience in land service 
<A NAME="1738"></A>usually gives them, and which they fancy will do the same for them at sea. 
<A NAME="1739"></A>But this advantage will in all justice belong to us on this element, if 
<A NAME="1740"></A>to them on that; as they are not superior to us in courage, but we are 
<A NAME="1741"></A>each of us more confident, according to our experience in our particular 
<A NAME="1742"></A>department. Besides, as the Lacedaemonians use their supremacy over their 
<A NAME="1743"></A>allies to promote their own glory, they are most of them being brought 
<A NAME="1744"></A>into danger against their will, or they would never, after such a decided 
<A NAME="1745"></A>defeat, have ventured upon a fresh engagement. You need not, therefore, 
<A NAME="1746"></A>be afraid of their dash. You, on the contrary, inspire a much greater and 
<A NAME="1747"></A>better founded alarm, both because of your late victory and also of their 
<A NAME="1748"></A>belief that we should not face them unless about to do something worthy 
<A NAME="1749"></A>of a success so signal. An adversary numerically superior, like the one 
<A NAME="1750"></A>before us, comes into action trusting more to strength than to resolution; 
<A NAME="1751"></A>while he who voluntarily confronts tremendous odds must have very great 
<A NAME="1752"></A>internal resources to draw upon. For these reasons the Peloponnesians fear 
<A NAME="1753"></A>our irrational audacity more than they would ever have done a more commensurate 
<A NAME="1754"></A>preparation. Besides, many armaments have before now succumbed to an inferior 
<A NAME="1755"></A>through want of skill or sometimes of courage; neither of which defects 
<A NAME="1756"></A>certainly are ours. As to the battle, it shall not be, if I can help it, 
<A NAME="1757"></A>in the strait, nor will I sail in there at all; seeing that in a contest 
<A NAME="1758"></A>between a number of clumsily managed vessels and a small, fast, well-handled 
<A NAME="1759"></A>squadron, want of sea room is an undoubted disadvantage. One cannot run 
<A NAME="1760"></A>down an enemy properly without having a sight of him a good way off, nor 
<A NAME="1761"></A>can one retire at need when pressed; one can neither break the line nor 
<A NAME="1762"></A>return upon his rear, the proper tactics for a fast sailer; but the naval 
<A NAME="1763"></A>action necessarily becomes a land one, in which numbers must decide the 
<A NAME="1764"></A>matter. For all this I will provide as far as can be. Do you stay at your 
<A NAME="1765"></A>posts by your ships, and be sharp at catching the word of command, the 
<A NAME="1766"></A>more so as we are observing one another from so short a distance; and in 
<A NAME="1767"></A>action think order and silence all-important- qualities useful in war generally, 
<A NAME="1768"></A>and in naval engagements in particular; and behave before the enemy in 
<A NAME="1769"></A>a manner worthy of your past exploits. The issues you will fight for are 
<A NAME="1770"></A>great- to destroy the naval hopes of the Peloponnesians or to bring nearer 
<A NAME="1771"></A>to the Athenians their fears for the sea. And I may once more remind you 
<A NAME="1772"></A>that you have defeated most of them already; and beaten men do not face 
<A NAME="1773"></A>a danger twice with the same determination."
<A NAME="1774"></A><BR><BR>Such was the exhortation of Phormio. The Peloponnesians finding 
<A NAME="1775"></A>that the Athenians did not sail into the gulf and the narrows, in order 
<A NAME="1776"></A>to lead them in whether they wished it or not, put out at dawn, and forming 
<A NAME="1777"></A>four abreast, sailed inside the gulf in the direction of their own country, 
<A NAME="1778"></A>the right wing leading as they had lain at anchor. In this wing were placed 
<A NAME="1779"></A>twenty of their best sailers; so that in the event of Phormio thinking 
<A NAME="1780"></A>that their object was Naupactus, and coasting along thither to save the 
<A NAME="1781"></A>place, the Athenians might not be able to escape their onset by getting 
<A NAME="1782"></A>outside their wing, but might be cut off by the vessels in question. As 
<A NAME="1783"></A>they expected, Phormio, in alarm for the place at that moment emptied of 
<A NAME="1784"></A>its garrison, as soon as he saw them put out, reluctantly and hurriedly 
<A NAME="1785"></A>embarked and sailed along shore; the Messenian land forces moving along 
<A NAME="1786"></A>also to support him. The Peloponnesians seeing him coasting along with 
<A NAME="1787"></A>his ships in single file, and by this inside the gulf and close inshore 
<A NAME="1788"></A>as they so much wished, at one signal tacked suddenly and bore down in 
<A NAME="1789"></A>line at their best speed on the Athenians, hoping to cut off the whole 
<A NAME="1790"></A>squadron. The eleven leading vessels, however, escaped the Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="1791"></A>wing and its sudden movement, and reached the more open water; but the 
<A NAME="1792"></A>rest were overtaken as they tried to run through, driven ashore and disabled; 
<A NAME="1793"></A>such of the crews being slain as had not swum out of them. Some of the 
<A NAME="1794"></A>ships the Peloponnesians lashed to their own, and towed off empty; one 
<A NAME="1795"></A>they took with the men in it; others were just being towed off, when they 
<A NAME="1796"></A>were saved by the Messenians dashing into the sea with their armour and 
<A NAME="1797"></A>fighting from the decks that they had boarded.
<A NAME="1798"></A><BR><BR>Thus far victory was with the Peloponnesians, and the Athenian 
<A NAME="1799"></A>fleet destroyed; the twenty ships in the right wing being meanwhile in 
<A NAME="1800"></A>chase of the eleven Athenian vessels that had escaped their sudden movement 
<A NAME="1801"></A>and reached the more open water. These, with the exception of one ship, 
<A NAME="1802"></A>all outsailed them and got safe into Naupactus, and forming close inshore 
<A NAME="1803"></A>opposite the temple of Apollo, with their prows facing the enemy, prepared 
<A NAME="1804"></A>to defend themselves in case the Peloponnesians should sail inshore against 
<A NAME="1805"></A>them. After a while the Peloponnesians came up, chanting the paean for 
<A NAME="1806"></A>their victory as they sailed on; the single Athenian ship remaining being 
<A NAME="1807"></A>chased by a Leucadian far ahead of the rest. But there happened to be a 
<A NAME="1808"></A>merchantman lying at anchor in the roadstead, which the Athenian ship found 
<A NAME="1809"></A>time to sail round, and struck the Leucadian in chase amidships and sank 
<A NAME="1810"></A>her. An exploit so sudden and unexpected produced a panic among the Peloponnesians; 
<A NAME="1811"></A>and having fallen out of order in the excitement of victory, some of them 
<A NAME="1812"></A>dropped their oars and stopped their way in order to let the main body 
<A NAME="1813"></A>come up- an unsafe thing to do considering how near they were to the enemy's 
<A NAME="1814"></A>prows; while others ran aground in the shallows, in their ignorance of 
<A NAME="1815"></A>the localities.
<A NAME="1816"></A><BR><BR>Elated at this incident, the Athenians at one word gave a cheer, 
<A NAME="1817"></A>and dashed at the enemy, who, embarrassed by his mistakes and the disorder 
<A NAME="1818"></A>in which he found himself, only stood for an instant, and then fled for 
<A NAME="1819"></A>Panormus, whence he had put out. The Athenians following on his heels took 
<A NAME="1820"></A>the six vessels nearest them, and recovered those of their own which had 
<A NAME="1821"></A>been disabled close inshore and taken in tow at the beginning of the action; 
<A NAME="1822"></A>they killed some of the crews and took some prisoners. On board the Leucadian 
<A NAME="1823"></A>which went down off the merchantman, was the Lacedaemonian Timocrates, 
<A NAME="1824"></A>who killed himself when the ship was sunk, and was cast up in the harbour 
<A NAME="1825"></A>of Naupactus. The Athenians on their return set up a trophy on the spot 
<A NAME="1826"></A>from which they had put out and turned the day, and picking up the wrecks 
<A NAME="1827"></A>and dead that were on their shore, gave back to the enemy their dead under 
<A NAME="1828"></A>truce. The Peloponnesians also set up a trophy as victors for the defeat 
<A NAME="1829"></A>inflicted upon the ships they had disabled in shore, and dedicated the 
<A NAME="1830"></A>vessel which they had taken at Achaean Rhium, side by side with the trophy. 
<A NAME="1831"></A>After this, apprehensive of the reinforcement expected from Athens, all 
<A NAME="1832"></A>except the Leucadians sailed into the Crissaean Gulf for Corinth. Not long 
<A NAME="1833"></A>after their retreat, the twenty Athenian ships, which were to have joined 
<A NAME="1834"></A>Phormio before the battle, arrived at Naupactus.
<A NAME="1835"></A><BR><BR>Thus the summer ended. Winter was now at hand; but dispersing the 
<A NAME="1836"></A>fleet, which had retired to Corinth and the Crissaean Gulf, Cnemus, Brasidas, 
<A NAME="1837"></A>and the other Peloponnesian captains allowed themselves to be persuaded 
<A NAME="1838"></A>by the Megarians to make an attempt upon Piraeus, the port of Athens, which 
<A NAME="1839"></A>from her decided superiority at sea had been naturally left unguarded and 
<A NAME="1840"></A>open. Their plan was as follows: The men were each to take their oar, cushion, 
<A NAME="1841"></A>and rowlock thong, and, going overland from Corinth to the sea on the Athenian 
<A NAME="1842"></A>side, to get to Megara as quickly as they could, and launching forty vessels, 
<A NAME="1843"></A>which happened to be in the docks at Nisaea, to sail at once to Piraeus. 
<A NAME="1844"></A>There was no fleet on the look-out in the harbour, and no one had the least 
<A NAME="1845"></A>idea of the enemy attempting a surprise; while an open attack would, it 
<A NAME="1846"></A>was thought, never be deliberately ventured on, or, if in contemplation, 
<A NAME="1847"></A>would be speedily known at Athens. Their plan formed, the next step was 
<A NAME="1848"></A>to put it in execution. Arriving by night and launching the vessels from 
<A NAME="1849"></A>Nisaea, they sailed, not to Piraeus as they had originally intended, being 
<A NAME="1850"></A>afraid of the risk, besides which there was some talk of a wind having 
<A NAME="1851"></A>stopped them, but to the point of Salamis that looks towards Megara; where 
<A NAME="1852"></A>there was a fort and a squadron of three ships to prevent anything sailing 
<A NAME="1853"></A>in or out of Megara. This fort they assaulted, and towed off the galleys 
<A NAME="1854"></A>empty, and surprising the inhabitants began to lay waste the rest of the 
<A NAME="1855"></A>island.
<A NAME="1856"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile fire signals were raised to alarm Athens, and a panic 
<A NAME="1857"></A>ensued there as serious as any that occurred during the war. The idea in 
<A NAME="1858"></A>the city was that the enemy had already sailed into Piraeus: in Piraeus 
<A NAME="1859"></A>it was thought that they had taken Salamis and might at any moment arrive 
<A NAME="1860"></A>in the port; as indeed might easily have been done if their hearts had 
<A NAME="1861"></A>been a little firmer: certainly no wind would have prevented them. As soon 
<A NAME="1862"></A>as day broke, the Athenians assembled in full force, launched their ships, 
<A NAME="1863"></A>and embarking in haste and uproar went with the fleet to Salamis, while 
<A NAME="1864"></A>their soldiery mounted guard in Piraeus. The Peloponnesians, on becoming 
<A NAME="1865"></A>aware of the coming relief, after they had overrun most of Salamis, hastily 
<A NAME="1866"></A>sailed off with their plunder and captives and the three ships from Fort 
<A NAME="1867"></A>Budorum to Nisaea; the state of their ships also causing them some anxiety, 
<A NAME="1868"></A>as it was a long while since they had been launched, and they were not 
<A NAME="1869"></A>water-tight. Arrived at Megara, they returned back on foot to Corinth. 
<A NAME="1870"></A>The Athenians finding them no longer at Salamis, sailed back themselves; 
<A NAME="1871"></A>and after this made arrangements for guarding Piraeus more diligently in 
<A NAME="1872"></A>future, by closing the harbours, and by other suitable 
<A NAME="1873"></A>precautions.
<A NAME="1874"></A><BR><BR>About the same time, at the beginning of this winter, Sitalces, 
<A NAME="1875"></A>son of Teres, the Odrysian king of Thrace, made an expedition against Perdiccas, 
<A NAME="1876"></A>son of Alexander, king of Macedonia, and the Chalcidians in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="1877"></A>of Thrace; his object being to enforce one promise and fulfil another. 
<A NAME="1878"></A>On the one hand Perdiccas had made him a promise, when hard pressed at 
<A NAME="1879"></A>the commencement of the war, upon condition that Sitalces should reconcile 
<A NAME="1880"></A>the Athenians to him and not attempt to restore his brother and enemy, 
<A NAME="1881"></A>the pretender Philip, but had not offered to fulfil his engagement; on 
<A NAME="1882"></A>the other he, Sitalces, on entering into alliance with the Athenians, had 
<A NAME="1883"></A>agreed to put an end to the Chalcidian war in Thrace. These were the two 
<A NAME="1884"></A>objects of his invasion. With him he brought Amyntas, the son of Philip, 
<A NAME="1885"></A>whom he destined for the throne of Macedonia, and some Athenian envoys 
<A NAME="1886"></A>then at his court on this business, and Hagnon as general; for the Athenians 
<A NAME="1887"></A>were to join him against the Chalcidians with a fleet and as many soldiers 
<A NAME="1888"></A>as they could get together.
<A NAME="1889"></A><BR><BR>Beginning with the Odrysians, he first called out the Thracian 
<A NAME="1890"></A>tribes subject to him between Mounts Haemus and Rhodope and the Euxine 
<A NAME="1891"></A>and Hellespont; next the Getae beyond Haemus, and the other hordes settled 
<A NAME="1892"></A>south of the Danube in the neighbourhood of the Euxine, who, like the Getae, 
<A NAME="1893"></A>border on the Scythians and are armed in the same manner, being all mounted 
<A NAME="1894"></A>archers. Besides these he summoned many of the hill Thracian independent 
<A NAME="1895"></A>swordsmen, called Dii and mostly inhabiting Mount Rhodope, some of whom 
<A NAME="1896"></A>came as mercenaries, others as volunteers; also the Agrianes and Laeaeans, 
<A NAME="1897"></A>and the rest of the Paeonian tribes in his empire, at the confines of which 
<A NAME="1898"></A>these lay, extending up to the Laeaean Paeonians and the river Strymon, 
<A NAME="1899"></A>which flows from Mount Scombrus through the country of the Agrianes and 
<A NAME="1900"></A>Laeaeans; there the empire of Sitalces ends and the territory of the independent 
<A NAME="1901"></A>Paeonians begins. Bordering on the Triballi, also independent, were the 
<A NAME="1902"></A>Treres and Tilataeans, who dwell to the north of Mount Scombrus and extend 
<A NAME="1903"></A>towards the setting sun as far as the river Oskius. This river rises in 
<A NAME="1904"></A>the same mountains as the Nestus and Hebrus, a wild and extensive range 
<A NAME="1905"></A>connected with Rhodope.
<A NAME="1906"></A><BR><BR>The empire of the Odrysians extended along the seaboard from Abdera 
<A NAME="1907"></A>to the mouth of the Danube in the Euxine. The navigation of this coast 
<A NAME="1908"></A>by the shortest route takes a merchantman four days and four nights with 
<A NAME="1909"></A>a wind astern the whole way: by land an active man, travelling by the shortest 
<A NAME="1910"></A>road, can get from Abdera to the Danube in eleven days. Such was the length 
<A NAME="1911"></A>of its coast line. Inland from Byzantium to the Laeaeans and the Strymon, 
<A NAME="1912"></A>the farthest limit of its extension into the interior, it is a journey 
<A NAME="1913"></A>of thirteen days for an active man. The tribute from all the barbarian 
<A NAME="1914"></A>districts and the Hellenic cities, taking what they brought in under Seuthes, 
<A NAME="1915"></A>the successor of Sitalces, who raised it to its greatest height, amounted 
<A NAME="1916"></A>to about four hundred talents in gold and silver. There were also presents 
<A NAME="1917"></A>in gold and silver to a no less amount, besides stuff, plain and embroidered, 
<A NAME="1918"></A>and other articles, made not only for the king, but also for the Odrysian 
<A NAME="1919"></A>lords and nobles. For there was here established a custom opposite to that 
<A NAME="1920"></A>prevailing in the Persian kingdom, namely, of taking rather than giving; 
<A NAME="1921"></A>more disgrace being attached to not giving when asked than to asking and 
<A NAME="1922"></A>being refused; and although this prevailed elsewhere in Thrace, it was 
<A NAME="1923"></A>practised most extensively among the powerful Odrysians, it being impossible 
<A NAME="1924"></A>to get anything done without a present. It was thus a very powerful kingdom; 
<A NAME="1925"></A>in revenue and general prosperity surpassing all in Europe between the 
<A NAME="1926"></A>Ionian Gulf and the Euxine, and in numbers and military resources coming 
<A NAME="1927"></A>decidedly next to the Scythians, with whom indeed no people in Europe can 
<A NAME="1928"></A>bear comparison, there not being even in Asia any nation singly a match 
<A NAME="1929"></A>for them if unanimous, though of course they are not on a level with other 
<A NAME="1930"></A>races in general intelligence and the arts of civilized 
<A NAME="1931"></A>life.
<A NAME="1932"></A><BR><BR>It was the master of this empire that now prepared to take the 
<A NAME="1933"></A>field. When everything was ready, he set out on his march for Macedonia, 
<A NAME="1934"></A>first through his own dominions, next over the desolate range of Cercine 
<A NAME="1935"></A>that divides the Sintians and Paeonians, crossing by a road which he had 
<A NAME="1936"></A>made by felling the timber on a former campaign against the latter people. 
<A NAME="1937"></A>Passing over these mountains, with the Paeonians on his right and the Sintians 
<A NAME="1938"></A>and Maedians on the left, he finally arrived at Doberus, in Paeonia, losing 
<A NAME="1939"></A>none of his army on the march, except perhaps by sickness, but receiving 
<A NAME="1940"></A>some augmentations, many of the independent Thracians volunteering to join 
<A NAME="1941"></A>him in the hope of plunder; so that the whole is said to have formed a 
<A NAME="1942"></A>grand total of a hundred and fifty thousand. Most of this was infantry, 
<A NAME="1943"></A>though there was about a third cavalry, furnished principally by the Odrysians 
<A NAME="1944"></A>themselves and next to them by the Getae. The most warlike of the infantry 
<A NAME="1945"></A>were the independent swordsmen who came down from Rhodope; the rest of 
<A NAME="1946"></A>the mixed multitude that followed him being chiefly formidable by their 
<A NAME="1947"></A>numbers.
<A NAME="1948"></A><BR><BR>Assembling in Doberus, they prepared for descending from the heights 
<A NAME="1949"></A>upon Lower Macedonia, where the dominions of Perdiccas lay; for the Lyncestae, 
<A NAME="1950"></A>Elimiots, and other tribes more inland, though Macedonians by blood, and 
<A NAME="1951"></A>allies and dependants of their kindred, still have their own separate governments. 
<A NAME="1952"></A>The country on the sea coast, now called Macedonia, was first acquired 
<A NAME="1953"></A>by Alexander, the father of Perdiccas, and his ancestors, originally Temenids 
<A NAME="1954"></A>from Argos. This was effected by the expulsion from Pieria of the Pierians, 
<A NAME="1955"></A>who afterwards inhabited Phagres and other places under Mount Pangaeus, 
<A NAME="1956"></A>beyond the Strymon (indeed the country between Pangaeus and the sea is 
<A NAME="1957"></A>still called the Pierian Gulf); of the Bottiaeans, at present neighbours 
<A NAME="1958"></A>of the Chalcidians, from Bottia, and by the acquisition in Paeonia of a 
<A NAME="1959"></A>narrow strip along the river Axius extending to Pella and the sea; the 
<A NAME="1960"></A>district of Mygdonia, between the Axius and the Strymon, being also added 
<A NAME="1961"></A>by the expulsion of the Edonians. From Eordia also were driven the Eordians, 
<A NAME="1962"></A>most of whom perished, though a few of them still live round Physca, and 
<A NAME="1963"></A>the Almopians from Almopia. These Macedonians also conquered places belonging 
<A NAME="1964"></A>to the other tribes, which are still theirs- Anthemus, Crestonia, Bisaltia, 
<A NAME="1965"></A>and much of Macedonia proper. The whole is now called Macedonia, and at 
<A NAME="1966"></A>the time of the invasion of Sitalces, Perdiccas, Alexander's son, was the 
<A NAME="1967"></A>reigning king.
<A NAME="1968"></A><BR><BR>These Macedonians, unable to take the field against so numerous 
<A NAME="1969"></A>an invader, shut themselves up in such strong places and fortresses as 
<A NAME="1970"></A>the country possessed. Of these there was no great number, most of those 
<A NAME="1971"></A>now found in the country having been erected subsequently by Archelaus, 
<A NAME="1972"></A>the son of Perdiccas, on his accession, who also cut straight roads, and 
<A NAME="1973"></A>otherwise put the kingdom on a better footing as regards horses, heavy 
<A NAME="1974"></A>infantry, and other war material than had been done by all the eight kings 
<A NAME="1975"></A>that preceded him. Advancing from Doberus, the Thracian host first invaded 
<A NAME="1976"></A>what had been once Philip's government, and took Idomene by assault, Gortynia, 
<A NAME="1977"></A>Atalanta, and some other places by negotiation, these last coming over 
<A NAME="1978"></A>for love of Philip's son, Amyntas, then with Sitalces. Laying siege to 
<A NAME="1979"></A>Europus, and failing to take it, he next advanced into the rest of Macedonia 
<A NAME="1980"></A>to the left of Pella and Cyrrhus, not proceeding beyond this into Bottiaea 
<A NAME="1981"></A>and Pieria, but staying to lay waste Mygdonia, Crestonia, and 
<A NAME="1982"></A>Anthemus.
<A NAME="1983"></A><BR><BR>The Macedonians never even thought of meeting him with infantry; 
<A NAME="1984"></A>but the Thracian host was, as opportunity offered, attacked by handfuls 
<A NAME="1985"></A>of their horse, which had been reinforced from their allies in the interior. 
<A NAME="1986"></A>Armed with cuirasses, and excellent horsemen, wherever these charged they 
<A NAME="1987"></A>overthrew all before them, but ran considerable risk in entangling themselves 
<A NAME="1988"></A>in the masses of the enemy, and so finally desisted from these efforts, 
<A NAME="1989"></A>deciding that they were not strong enough to venture against numbers so 
<A NAME="1990"></A>superior.
<A NAME="1991"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Sitalces opened negotiations with Perdiccas on the objects 
<A NAME="1992"></A>of his expedition; and finding that the Athenians, not believing that he 
<A NAME="1993"></A>would come, did not appear with their fleet, though they sent presents 
<A NAME="1994"></A>and envoys, dispatched a large part of his army against the Chalcidians 
<A NAME="1995"></A>and Bottiaeans, and shutting them up inside their walls laid waste their 
<A NAME="1996"></A>country. While he remained in these parts, the people farther south, such 
<A NAME="1997"></A>as the Thessalians, Magnetes, and the other tribes subject to the Thessalians, 
<A NAME="1998"></A>and the Hellenes as far as Thermopylae, all feared that the army might 
<A NAME="1999"></A>advance against them, and prepared accordingly. These fears were shared 
<A NAME="2000"></A>by the Thracians beyond the Strymon to the north, who inhabited the plains, 
<A NAME="2001"></A>such as the Panaeans, the Odomanti, the Droi, and the Dersaeans, all of 
<A NAME="2002"></A>whom are independent. It was even matter of conversation among the Hellenes 
<A NAME="2003"></A>who were enemies of Athens whether he might not be invited by his ally 
<A NAME="2004"></A>to advance also against them. Meanwhile he held Chalcidice and Bottice 
<A NAME="2005"></A>and Macedonia, and was ravaging them all; but finding that he was not succeeding 
<A NAME="2006"></A>in any of the objects of his invasion, and that his army was without provisions 
<A NAME="2007"></A>and was suffering from the severity of the season, he listened to the advice 
<A NAME="2008"></A>of Seuthes, son of Spardacus, his nephew and highest officer, and decided 
<A NAME="2009"></A>to retreat without delay. This Seuthes had been secretly gained by Perdiccas 
<A NAME="2010"></A>by the promise of his sister in marriage with a rich dowry. In accordance 
<A NAME="2011"></A>with this advice, and after a stay of thirty days in all, eight of which 
<A NAME="2012"></A>were spent in Chalcidice, he retired home as quickly as he could; and Perdiccas 
<A NAME="2013"></A>afterwards gave his sister Stratonice to Seuthes as he had promised. Such 
<A NAME="2014"></A>was the history of the expedition of Sitalces.
<A NAME="2015"></A><BR><BR>In the course of this winter, after the dispersion of the Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="2016"></A>fleet, the Athenians in Naupactus, under Phormio, coasted along to Astacus 
<A NAME="2017"></A>and disembarked, and marched into the interior of Acarnania with four hundred 
<A NAME="2018"></A>Athenian heavy infantry and four hundred Messenians. After expelling some 
<A NAME="2019"></A>suspected persons from Stratus, Coronta, and other places, and restoring 
<A NAME="2020"></A>Cynes, son of Theolytus, to Coronta, they returned to their ships, deciding 
<A NAME="2021"></A>that it was impossible in the winter season to march against Oeniadae, 
<A NAME="2022"></A>a place which, unlike the rest of Acarnania, had been always hostile to 
<A NAME="2023"></A>them; for the river Achelous flowing from Mount Pindus through Dolopia 
<A NAME="2024"></A>and the country of the Agraeans and Amphilochians and the plain of Acarnania, 
<A NAME="2025"></A>past the town of Stratus in the upper part of its course, forms lakes where 
<A NAME="2026"></A>it falls into the sea round Oeniadae, and thus makes it impracticable for 
<A NAME="2027"></A>an army in winter by reason of the water. Opposite to Oeniadae lie most 
<A NAME="2028"></A>of the islands called Echinades, so close to the mouths of the Achelous 
<A NAME="2029"></A>that that powerful stream is constantly forming deposits against them, 
<A NAME="2030"></A>and has already joined some of the islands to the continent, and seems 
<A NAME="2031"></A>likely in no long while to do the same with the rest. For the current is 
<A NAME="2032"></A>strong, deep, and turbid, and the islands are so thick together that they 
<A NAME="2033"></A>serve to imprison the alluvial deposit and prevent its dispersing, lying, 
<A NAME="2034"></A>as they do, not in one line, but irregularly, so as to leave no direct 
<A NAME="2035"></A>passage for the water into the open sea. The islands in question are uninhabited 
<A NAME="2036"></A>and of no great size. There is also a story that Alcmaeon, son of Amphiraus, 
<A NAME="2037"></A>during his wanderings after the murder of his mother was bidden by Apollo 
<A NAME="2038"></A>to inhabit this spot, through an oracle which intimated that he would have 
<A NAME="2039"></A>no release from his terrors until he should find a country to dwell in 
<A NAME="2040"></A>which had not been seen by the sun, or existed as land at the time he slew 
<A NAME="2041"></A>his mother; all else being to him polluted ground. Perplexed at this, the 
<A NAME="2042"></A>story goes on to say, he at last observed this deposit of the Achelous, 
<A NAME="2043"></A>and considered that a place sufficient to support life upon, might have 
<A NAME="2044"></A>been thrown up during the long interval that had elapsed since the death 
<A NAME="2045"></A>of his mother and the beginning of his wanderings. Settling, therefore, 
<A NAME="2046"></A>in the district round Oeniadae, he founded a dominion, and left the country 
<A NAME="2047"></A>its name from his son Acarnan. Such is the story we have received concerning 
<A NAME="2048"></A>Alcmaeon.
<A NAME="2049"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians and Phormio putting back from Acarnania and arriving 
<A NAME="2050"></A>at Naupactus, sailed home to Athens in the spring, taking with them the 
<A NAME="2051"></A>ships that they had captured, and such of the prisoners made in the late 
<A NAME="2052"></A>actions as were freemen; who were exchanged, man for man. And so ended 
<A NAME="2053"></A>this winter, and the third year of this war, of which Thucydides was the 
<A NAME="2054"></A>historian.
