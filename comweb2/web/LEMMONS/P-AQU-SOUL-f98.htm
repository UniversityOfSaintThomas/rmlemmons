<DIV ALIGN=right><B>ON THE SOUL'S IMMATERIALITY AND EXISTENCE</B></DIV>


<P><B>I.75.1: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IMMATERIAL?</B>

<P><B><I>N.B. The way in which Aquinas argues for the soul's immateriality
identifies his philosophy as hylomorphic. Hylomorphism teaches that the
soul activates matter into a living body.</I></B>

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, between the mover and the moved there must be contact.
But contact is only between bodies. Since, therefore, the soul moves the
body, it seems that the soul must be a material body.</B>

<P><B>I answer that, To seek the nature of the soul, we must premise that
the soul is defined as the first principle of life of those things which
live: for we call living things "animate," [*i.e. having a soul], and those
things which have no life, "inanimate." Now life is shown principally by
two actions, knowledge and movement.</B>

<P><B><I>The philosophers of old</I> . . . supposed that the principle
of these actions was something corporeal: for they asserted that only bodies
were real things; and that what is not corporeal is nothing: hence they
maintained that the soul is something corporeal. This opinion can be proved
to be false in many ways; but we shall make use of only one proof, based
on universal and certain principles, which shows clearly that the soul
is not a body.</B>

<P><B>Now, though matter may be a principle of life as the heart is a principle
of life in an animal, nothing material can be the first principle of life.
For it is clear that to be a principle of life, or to be alive, does not
belong to matter as such; since, if that were the case, all material things
would be alive. Therefore matter---which is able to be a living thing or
even a principle of life---is as such only <I>potentially</I> a living
body. When it is <I>actually</I> a body, some principle must be activating
its potency for being a living body. [That principle of activation is the
soul.] Accordingly, the soul as the first principle of life [does not consists
of matter; it is rather immaterial so that it can animate matter into a
living body.]</B>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 3: [Not all contact is between bodies.] There are two kinds
of contact; of "quantity," and of "power." By the former a body can be
touched only by a body; by the latter a body can be touched by an incorporeal
thing, which moves that body.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I.75.2: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS SOMETHING SUBSISTENT?</B>

<P><B><I>N.B. Since subsistence means to exist on one's own, this article
is asking whether the human soul has the type of existence that enables
it to exist on its own, i.e. independently of matter. If the human soul
does not subsist, then its existence relies upon matter and ceases when
the body is unable to sustain life.</I></B>

<P><B><I>ARTICLE COMMENTARY: In this article Aquinas relies upon the principle
that ACTION FOLLOWS EXISTENCE, i.e. a thing acts according to its mode
of existence. Thus, if the intellect has an act that is independent of
matter, then it must exist independently of matter (it must be its own
subsistence). The intellect has such an act because its ability to know
all material things presupposes that it does not consists of matter; the
intellect is not the brain. This article thus presents a key argument against
materialism.</I></B>

<P><B><I>Another argument based upon Thomistic principles is that since
matter is the principle of individuation, universals can neither exist
in matter nor be known by a material entity. Therefore, the intellectual
soul which knows universals cannot be material. See I.75.5 for Aquinas'
more detailed argument.</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, if the soul were subsistent, it would have some operation
apart from the body. But it has no operation apart from the body, not even
that of understanding: for the act of understanding does not take place
without a <I>sense image</I>, which cannot exist apart from the body. Therefore
the human soul is not something subsistent.</B>

<P><B>I answer that, It must necessarily be allowed that the principle
of intellectual operation which we call the soul, is a principle both incorporeal
and subsistent. For it is clear that by means of the intellect man can
have knowledge of all corporeal things. Now whatever knows certain things
cannot have any of them in its own nature; because that which is in it
naturally would impede the knowledge of anything else. Thus we observe
that . . . [none can sense the temperature of water when the hand is as
warm as the water]. Hence, if the intellectual principle contained the
nature of a body it would be unable to know all bodies. Therefore, since
every body has its own determinate nature, it is impossible for the intellectual
principle to be a body. It is likewise impossible for it to understand
by means of a bodily organ; since the determinate nature of that organ
would impede knowledge of all bodies; as when a certain determinate color
is not only in the pupil of the eye, but also in a glass vase, the liquid
in the vase seems to be of that same color.</B>

<P><B>Therefore the intellectual principle which we call the mind or the
intellect has an operation in and through itself apart from the body. Now
only that which subsists can have an operation in and through itself. For
nothing can operate but what is actual: for which reason we do not say
that heat imparts heat, but that what is hot gives heat. We must conclude,
therefore, that the human soul, which is called the intellect or the mind,
is something incorporeal and subsistent.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Reply OBJ 3: The body is necessary for the action of the intellect,
not as its origin of action, but on the part of the object; for the sense
image is to the intellect what color is to the sight. Neither does such
a dependence on the body prove the intellect to be non-subsistent; otherwise
it would follow that an animal is non-subsistent, since it requires external
objects of the senses in order to perform its act of perception.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I.75.3: WHETHER THE SOULS OF BRUTE ANIMALS ARE SUBSISTENT?</B>

<P><B><I>N.B. If animal souls are subsistent, then it would be possible
for animals to be immortal.</I></B>

<P><B>OBJ 1: It would seem that the souls of brute animals are subsistent.
For man is of the same 'genus' as other animals; and, as we have just shown
(A2), the soul of man is subsistent. Therefore the souls of other animals
are subsistent.</B>

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, the soul of brute animals moves the body. But the
body is not a mover, but is moved. Therefore the soul of brute animals
has an operation apart from the body.</B>

<P><B>I answer that, <I>The ancient philosophers</I> made no distinction
between sense and intellect, and referred both to a corporeal principle,
as has been said (A1). <I>Plato</I>, however, drew a distinction between
intellect and sense; yet he referred both to an incorporeal principle,
maintaining that sensing, just as understanding, belongs to the soul as
such. From this it follows that even the souls of brute animals are subsistent.
But <I>Aristotle</I> held that of the operations of the soul, understanding
alone is performed without a corporeal organ.</B>

<P><B><I>On the other hand</I>, sensation and the consequent operations
of the sensitive soul are evidently accompanied with change in the body;
thus in the act of vision, the pupil of the eye is affected by a reflection
of color: and so with the other senses. Hence it is clear that the sensitive
soul has no act in and through itself, and that every operation of the
sensitive soul belongs to the composite. Therefore we conclude that since
the souls of brute animals have no acts in and through themselves, they
are not subsistent. For the operation of anything follows the mode of its
being.</B>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 1: Although man is of the same "genus" as other animals,
he is of a different "species." Specific difference is derived from the
difference of form; nor does every difference of form necessarily imply
a diversity of "genus."</B>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 3: Motive power is of <I>two</I> kinds. <I>One</I>, the
appetitive power, commands motion. The operation of this power in the sensitive
soul is not apart from the body; for anger, joy, and passions of a like
nature are accompanied by a change in the body. The <I>other</I> motive
power is that which executes motion in adapting the members for obeying
the appetite; and the act of this power does not consist in moving, but
in being moved. Whence it is clear that to move is not an act of the sensitive
soul without the body.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I.75.4: WHETHER THE SOUL IS MAN?</B>

<P><B><I>N.B. If Aquinas would argue that the soul is man, then Aquinas
would hold the same position as Plato.</I></B> <B><I>Moreover, if the soul
is man, then the transmigration of the human soul into another body would
be possible. Accordingly, this article is important not only because it
differentiates Aquinas from Plato but also because its emphasis upon the
importance of matter to human nature strengthens our understanding of Thomistic
hylomorphism.</I></B>

<P><B>OBJ 1: It would seem that the soul is man. For it is written (2 Cor.
4:16): "Though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed
day by day." But that which is within man is the soul. Therefore the soul
is the inward man.</B>

<P><B><I>ON THE CONTRARY</I>, Augustine (De Civ. Dei xix, 3) commends Varro
as holding "that man is not a mere soul, nor a mere body; but both soul
and body."</B>

<P><B>I answer that, The assertion "the soul is man," can be taken in <I>two</I>
senses. <I>First</I>, that man is a soul; though this particular man, Socrates,
for instance, is not a soul, but composed of soul and body. I say this,
for as much as some held that the form alone belongs to the species; while
matter is part of the individual, and not the species. This cannot be true;
for to the nature of the species belongs what the definition signifies;
and in natural things the definition does not signify the form only, but
the form and the matter. Hence in natural things the matter is part of
the species; not, indeed, <I>signate matter</I>, which is the principle
of individuality; but the <I>common matter</I>. For as it belongs to the
notion of this particular man to be composed of this soul, of this flesh,
and of these bones; so it belongs to the notion of man to be composed of
soul, flesh, and bones; for whatever belongs in common to the substance
of all the individuals contained under a given species, must belong to
the substance of the species.</B>

<P><B>It may also be understood in this sense, that this soul is this man;
and this could be held if it were supposed that the operation of the sensitive
soul were proper to it, apart from the body; because in that case all the
operations which are attributed to man would belong to the soul only; and
whatever performs the operations proper to a thing, is that thing; therefore
that which performs the operations of a man is man. But it has been shown
above (A3) that sensation is not the operation of the soul only. Since,
then, sensation is an operation of man, but not proper to him, it is clear
that man is not a soul only, but something composed of soul and body. <I>Plato</I>,
through supposing that sensation was proper to the soul, could maintain
man to be a soul making use of the body.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Reply OBJ 1: According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix, 8), a thing
seems to be chiefly what is principle in it; thus what the governor of
a state does, the state is said to do. In this way sometimes what is principle
in man is said to be man; sometimes, indeed, the intellectual part which,
in accordance with truth, is called the "inward" man; and sometimes the
sensitive part with the body is called man in the opinion of those whose
observation does not go beyond the senses. And this is called the "outward"
man.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I.75.5: WHETHER THE SOUL IS COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM?</B>

<P><B><I>N.B. Within this article are two arguments. The first is that
since soul is to matter as actuality is to potency, no soul is composed
of matter. The second argument relies upon the individuating character
of matter to prove that the human soul must be totally immaterial.</I></B>

<P><B>I answer that, The soul has no matter. We may consider this question
in two ways. <I>First,</I> from the notion of a soul in general; for it
belongs to the notion of a soul to be the form of a body. Now, <I>either</I>
it is a form by virtue of itself, in its entirety, <I>or</I> by virtue
of some part of itself. If by virtue of itself in its entirety, then it
is impossible that any part of it should be matter, if by matter we understand
something purely potential: for a form, as such, is an act; and that which
is purely potentiality cannot be part of an act, since potentiality is
repugnant to actuality as being opposite thereto. If, however, it be a
form by virtue of a part of itself, then we call that part the soul: and
that matter, which it actualizes first, we call "[a living] body."</B>

<P><B><I>Secondly</I>, we may proceed from the specific notion of the human
soul inasmuch as it is intellectual. For it is clear that whatever is received
into something is received according to the condition of the recipient.
Now a thing is known in as far as its form is in the knower. But the intellectual
soul [understands the universal natures of things]: for instance, it knows
a stone according to its nature as a stone [[as it knows wax according
to its nature as wax]]; and therefore the form of a stone universally considered
is in the intellectual soul. ...<I>But if the intellectual soul were composed
of matter and form, the forms of things would be received into it as individuals,
and so it would only know the individual</I>: just as it happens with the
sensitive powers which receive forms in a corporeal organ; since matter
is the principle by which forms are individualized. It follows, therefore,
that the intellectual soul, and every intellectual substance which has
knowledge of [universals] is exempt from composition of matter and form.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I.75.6: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS INCORRUPTIBLE?</B>

<P><B><I>N.B. If the soul is incorruptible, then it is immortal because
existence cannot be separated from what is incorruptible. Aquinas' argument
that the human soul is incorruptible relies upon the ideas that nothing
is divisible from itself and that the human soul and its subsistence are
one.</I></B>

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, nothing is without its own proper operation. But
the operation proper to the soul, which is to understand through a sense
image, cannot be without the body. For the soul understands nothing without
a sense image; and there is no sense image without the body as the Philosopher
says (De Anima i, 1). Therefore the soul cannot survive the dissolution
of the body.</B>

<P><B>I answer that, We must assert that the intellectual principle which
we call the human soul is incorruptible. For a thing may be corrupted in
two ways---through itself and through another. Now it is impossible for
any substance to be generated or corrupted through another. .... for generation
and corruption belong to a thing, just as existence belongs to it, which
is acquired by generation and lost by corruption. Therefore, whatever has
existence through itself cannot be generated or corrupted except through
itself; while things which do not subsist, such as properties and material
forms, acquire existence or lose it through the generation or corruption
of composite things. Now it was shown above (AA2,3) that the souls of brutes
are not self-subsistent, whereas the human soul is; so that the souls of
brutes are corrupted, when their bodies are corrupted; while the human
soul could not be corrupted unless it were corrupted "per se." This, indeed,
is impossible, not only as regards the human soul, but also as regards
anything subsistent that is a form alone. <I>For</I> it is clear that what
belongs to a thing by virtue of itself is inseparable from it; but subsistence
belongs to those forms which have an act that is NOT in and through matter
by virtue of itself. Therefore matter acquires actual existence as it acquires
the form; while it is corrupted so far as the form is separated from it.
But it is impossible for a form to be separated from itself; and therefore
it is impossible for a subsistent form to cease to exist.</B>

<P><B>... Moreover ...a sign [that this argument is right may be taken]
from the fact that everything naturally aspires to existence after its
own manner. Now, in things that have knowledge, desire ensues upon knowledge.
The senses indeed do not know existence, except under the conditions of
"here" and "now," whereas the intellect apprehends existence absolutely,
and for all time; so that everything that has an intellect naturally desires
always to exist. <I>But a natural desire cannot be in vain.</I> Therefore
every intellectual substance is incorruptible.</B>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 3: To understand through a sense image is the proper operation
of the soul by virtue of its union with the body. After separation from
the body it will have another mode of understanding, similar to other substances
separated from bodies, as will appear later on (Q89, A1).</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I.75.7: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS AN ANGEL?</B>

<P><B><I>N.B. If the human soul is subsistent, then it seems that it is
angelic. So the question arises whether human beings are really angels.
This article's argument relies upon the individuating character of quantified
matter in order to explain why there are many individuals within the human
species while there is only one individual within each species of angels.</I></B>

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, it seems that the soul does not differ from an angel
except in its union with the body. But as the body is outside the essence
of the soul, it seems that it does not belong to its species. Therefore
the soul and angel are of the same species.</B>

<P><B><I>ON THE CONTRARY</I>, Things which have different natural operations
are of different species. <I>[ACTIVITIES REVEAL NATURE</I>.] But the natural
operations of the soul and of an angel are different; since, as Dionysius
says (Div. Nom. vii), "Angelic minds have simple and blessed intelligence,
not gathering their knowledge of Divine things from visible things." Subsequently
he says the contrary to this of the soul. Therefore the soul and an angel
are not of the same species.</B>

<P><B>I answer that, angels and human souls cannot belong to the same species;
for in incorporeal substances there cannot be diversity of number without
diversity of species and inequality of nature; because, as they are not
composed of matter and form, but are subsistent forms, it is clear that
there is necessarily among them a diversity of species. For a separate
form cannot be understood otherwise than as one of a single species; thus,
supposing a separate whiteness to exist, it could only be one; forasmuch
as one whiteness does not differ from another except as in this or that
subject. . . .For if the matter of one be distinct from the matter of another,
it follows that either the form is the principle of the distinction of
matter--that is to say, that the matter is distinct on account of its relation
to divers forms; and even then there would result a difference of species
and inequality of nature; or else the matter is the principle of the distinction
of forms. But one matter cannot be distinct from another, except by a distinction
of quantity, which has no place in these incorporeal substances, such as
an angel and the soul. So that it is not possible for the angel and the
soul to be of the same species. . . . [In other words,<I> human beings
differ in their bodies but not in their species; while angels, since they
lack bodies, cannot differ except by being different species.]</I></B>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 3: The body is not of the essence of the soul; but the
soul by the nature of its essence can be united to the body, so that, properly
speaking, not the soul alone, but the "composite," is the species. And
the very fact that the soul in a certain way requires the body for its
operation, proves that the soul is endowed with a grade of intellectuality
inferior to that of an angel, who is not united to a body.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I. 76.3: WHETHER BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN OTHER
SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER?</B>

<P><B>OBJ 1: It would seem that besides the intellectual soul there are
in man other souls essentially different from one another, such as the
sensitive soul and the nutritive soul. For corruptible and incorruptible
are not of the same substance. But the intellectual soul is incorruptible;
whereas the other souls, as the sensitive and the nutritive, are corruptible,
as was shown above (Q75, A6). Therefore in man the essence of the intellectual
soul, the sensitive soul, and the nutritive soul, cannot be the same.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I answer that, <I>Plato</I> held that there were several souls in
one body, distinct even as to organs, to which souls he referred the different
vital actions, saying that the nutritive power is in the liver, the concupiscible
in the heart, and the power of knowledge in the brain. Which opinion is
rejected by <I>Aristotle</I> (De Anima ii, 2), with regard to those parts
of the soul which use corporeal organs; for this reason, that in those
animals which continue to live when they have been divided in each part
are observed the operations of the soul, as sense and appetite. Now this
would not be the case if the various principles of the soul's operations
were essentially different, and distributed in the various parts of the
body. But with regard to the intellectual part, he seems to leave it in
doubt whether it be "only logically" distinct from the other parts of the
soul, "or also locally."</B>

<P><B>The opinion of <I>Plato</I> might be maintained if, as he held, the
soul was supposed to be united to the body, not as its form, but as its
motor. For it involves nothing unreasonable that the same movable thing
be moved by several motors; and still less if it be moved according to
its various parts. If we suppose, however, that the soul is united to the
body as its form, it is quite impossible for several essentially different
souls to be in one body. This can be made clear by <I>three different reasons.</I></B>

<P><B>In the <I>first</I> place, an animal would not be absolutely one,
in which there were several souls. For nothing is absolutely one except
by one form, by which a thing has existence: because a thing has from the
same source both existence and unity; and therefore things which are denominated
by various forms are not absolutely one; as, for instance, "a white man."
If, therefore, man were 'living' by one form, the vegetative soul, and
'animal' by another form, the sensitive soul, and "man" by another form,
the intellectual soul, it would follow that man is not absolutely one.
Thus <I>Aristotle</I> argues, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6), against <I>Plato</I>,
that if the idea of an animal is distinct from the idea of a biped, then
a biped animal is not absolutely one. For this reason, against those who
hold that there are several souls in the body, he asks (De Anima i, 5),
"what contains them?"---that is, what makes them one? It cannot be said
that they are united by the one body; because rather does the soul contain
the body and make it one, than the reverse.</B>

<P><B><I>Secondly</I>, .... <I>Thirdly</I>, this is shown to be impossible
by the fact that when one operation of the soul is intense it impedes another,
which could never be the case unless the principle of action were essentially
one.</B>

<P><B>We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul, the intellectual
soul, and the nutritive soul are numerically one soul. This can easily
be explained, if we consider the differences of species and forms. For
we observe that the species and forms of things differ from one another,
as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the animate are
more perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect than plants,
and man than brute animals; and in each of these genera there are various
degrees. ....</B>

<P><B>Thus, neither is <I>Socrates</I> a man by one soul, and animal by
another; but by one and the same soul he is both animal and man.</B>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 1: The sensitive soul is incorruptible, not by reason of
its being sensitive, but by reason of its being intellectual. When, therefore,
a soul is sensitive only, it is corruptible; but when with sensibility
it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible. For although sensibility
does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot deprive intellectuality of
its incorruptibility. [In other words, the intellectual soul can do what
purely sentient and purely vegetative souls can do without being limited
to the functions of these lower souls. Cf. I.76.4c ". . .there is no other
<I>substantial form</I> in man besides the intellectual soul; and that
the soul, as it virtually contains the sensitive and nutritive souls, so
does it virtually contain all inferior forms, and itself alone does whatever
the imperfect forms do in other things. The same is to be said of the sensitive
soul in brute animals, and of the nutritive soul in plants, and universally
of all more perfect forms with regard to the imperfect."</B>

<P><B>ARTICLE COMMENTARY: If Aquinas is correct in arguing that every human
being has only one soul, then it is impossible for "humanoid animals" to
exist (i.e. no human body can be kept alive without the animating presence
of the intellectual soul). Death thus occurs when the soul ceases to animate
matter into a living body. This means that when some one suffers "neocortical
death" they are still alive even though the brain's destruction precludes
thought. It thus becomes matter of ethics to decide how to treat such persons
appropriately. See the following article for additional clarification.</B>

<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I.76.8: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IN EACH PART OF THE BODY?</B>

<P><B>I answer that, As we have said, if the soul were united to the body
merely as its motor, we might say that it is not in each part of the body,
but only in one part through which it would move the others. But since
the soul is united to the body as its form, it must necessarily be in the
whole body, and in each part thereof. For it is not an <I>accidental form</I>,
but the <I>substantial form</I> of the body. Now the <I>substantial form</I>
perfects not only the whole, but each part of the whole. For since a whole
consists of parts, a form of the whole which does not give existence to
each of the parts of the body, is a form consisting in composition and
order, such as the form of a house; and such a form is accidental. But
the soul is a <I>substantial form</I>; and therefore it must be the form
and the act, not only of the whole, but also of each part. Therefore, on
the withdrawal of the soul, as we do not speak of an animal or a man unless
equivocally, as we speak of a painted animal or a stone animal; so is it
with the hand, the eye, the flesh and bones, as the Philosopher says (De
Anima ii, 1). A proof of which is, that <I>on the withdrawal of the soul,
no part of the body retains its proper action</I>; although that which
retains its species, retains the action of the species. But act is in that
which it actuates: <I>therefore</I> the soul must be in the whole body,
and in each part thereof.</B>

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I.76.5: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS PROPERLY UNITED TO SUCH
A BODY?</B>

<P><B>I answer that, ... Now the intellectual soul, as we have seen above
(Q55, A2) in the order of nature, holds the lowest place among intellectual
substances; inasmuch as it is not naturally gifted with the knowledge of
truth, as the angels are; but has to gather knowledge from individual things
by way of the senses, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii). But nature never
fails in necessary things: therefore the intellectual soul had to be endowed
not only with the power of understanding, but also with the power of feeling.
Now the action of the senses is not performed without a corporeal instrument.
Therefore it behooved the intellectual soul to be united to a body fitted
to be a convenient organ of sense.</B>
