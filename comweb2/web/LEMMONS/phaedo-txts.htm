<b>why is suicide held not to be right?</b><b></b>
<p><i>For I am quite ready to acknowledge, Simmias and Cebes, that I ought
to be grieved at death, if I were not persuaded that I am going to other
gods who are wise and good (of this I am as certain as I can be of anything
of the sort) and to men departed (though I am not so certain of this),
who are better than those whom I leave behind; and therefore I do not grieve
as I might have done, fo</i><i></i>
<p><b>Do we believe that there is such a thing as death?</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<p>I should say the true philosopher would despise them. Would you not
say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?
He would like, as far as he can, to be quit of the body and turn to the
soul.
<p><b>What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge?-is
the body, if invited to share in the inquiry, a hinderer or a helper?</b><b></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Well, but there is another thing, Simmias: Is there
or is there not an absolute justice?</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1></font></b>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>Assuredly there is. And an absolute beauty and absolute
good? Of course.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><i>&nbsp;Will he not depart with joy? Surely he will, my friend, if
he be a true philosopher. For he will have a firm conviction that there
only, and nowhere else, he can find wisdom in her purity. And if this be
true, he would be very absurd, as I was saying, if he were to fear death.</i><i></i>
<p><b>And do we know the nature of this abstract essence?</b>
<br><i>Then reflect, Cebes: is not the conclusion of the whole matter this?-that
the soul is in the very likeness of the divine, and immortal, and intelligible,
and uniform, and indissoluble, and unchangeable; and the body is in the
very likeness of the human, and mortal, and unintelligible, and multiform,
and dissoluble, and changeable.</i>
<br><i></i>&nbsp;
<br><i></i>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><i>are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not departed
pure, but are cloyed with sight and therefore visible.</i><i></i>
<p><i>For as there are misanthropists or haters of men, there are also
misologists or haters of ideas, and both spring from the same cause, which
is ignorance of the world.</i>
