<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="15"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Socrates.</B> My dear Phaedrus, whence come you, and whither are you
going? <A NAME="16"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedrus.</B> I come from Lysias the son of Cephalus, and I am going
to take a walk <A NAME="17"></A>outside the wall, for I have been sitting
with him the whole morning; and our common friend <A NAME="18"></A>Acumenus
tells me that it is much more refreshing to walk in the open air than to
be shut up <A NAME="19"></A>in a cloister. <A NAME="20"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> There he is right. Lysias then, I suppose, was in the town?
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, he was staying with Epicrates, here at the house of
Morychus; that <A NAME="22"></A>house which is near the temple of Olympian
Zeus. <A NAME="23"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And how did he entertain you? Can I be wrong in supposing that
Lysias gave <A NAME="24"></A>you a feast of discourse? <A NAME="25"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> You shall hear, if you can spare time to accompany me. <A NAME="26"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And should I not deem the conversation of you and Lysias &quot;a
thing of higher <A NAME="27"></A>import,&quot; as I may say in the words
of Pindar, &quot;than any business&quot;? <A NAME="28"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Will you go on? <A NAME="29"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And will you go on with the narration? <A NAME="30"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> My tale, Socrates, is one of your sort, for love was the
theme which <A NAME="31"></A>occupied us -love after a fashion: Lysias
has been writing about a fair youth who was being <A NAME="32"></A>tempted,
but not by a lover; and this was the point: he ingeniously proved that
the non-lover <A NAME="33"></A>should be accepted rather than the lover.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> O that is noble of him! I wish that he would say the poor man
rather than <A NAME="35"></A>the rich, and the old man rather than the
young one; then he would meet the case of me and <A NAME="36"></A>of many
a man; his words would be quite refreshing, and he would be a public benefactor.
For <A NAME="37"></A>my part, I do so long to hear his speech, that if
you walk all the way to Megara, and when <A NAME="38"></A>you have reached
the wall come back, as Herodicus recommends, without going in, I will keep
<A NAME="39"></A>you company. <A NAME="40"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What do you mean, my good Socrates? How can you imagine
that my unpractised <A NAME="41"></A>memory can do justice to an elaborate
work, which the greatest rhetorician of the age spent <A NAME="42"></A>a
long time in composing. Indeed, I cannot; I would give a great deal if
I could. <A NAME="43"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I believe that I know Phaedrus about as well as I know myself,
and I am <A NAME="44"></A>very sure that the speech of Lysias was repeated
to him, not once only, but again and again;-he <A NAME="45"></A>insisted
on hearing it many times over and Lysias was very willing to gratify him;
at last, <A NAME="46"></A>when nothing else would do, he got hold of the
book, and looked at what he most wanted to see,-this <A NAME="47"></A>occupied
him during the whole morning; -and then when he was tired with sitting,
he went out <A NAME="48"></A>to take a walk, not until, by the dog, as
I believe, he had simply learned by heart the entire <A NAME="49"></A>discourse,
unless it was unusually long, and he went to a place outside the wall that
he might <A NAME="50"></A>practise his lesson. There he saw a certain lover
of discourse who had a similar weakness;-he <A NAME="51"></A>saw and rejoiced;
now thought he, &quot;I shall have a partner in my revels.&quot; And he
invited him <A NAME="52"></A>to come and walk with him. But when the lover
of discourse begged that he would repeat the <A NAME="53"></A>tale, he
gave himself airs and said, &quot;No I cannot,&quot; as if he were indisposed;
although, if <A NAME="54"></A>the hearer had refused, he would sooner or
later have been compelled by him to listen whether <A NAME="55"></A>he
would or no. Therefore, Phaedrus, bid him do at once what he will soon
do whether bidden <A NAME="56"></A>or not. <A NAME="57"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I see that you will not let me off until I speak in some
fashion or <A NAME="58"></A>other; verily therefore my best plan is to
speak as I best can. <A NAME="59"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> A very true remark, that of yours. <A NAME="60"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I will do as I say; but believe me, Socrates, I did not
learn the very <A NAME="61"></A>words-O no; nevertheless I have a general
notion of what he said, and will give you a summary <A NAME="62"></A>of
the points in which the lover differed from the non-lover. Let me begin
at the beginning. <A NAME="63"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes, my sweet one; but you must first of all show what you
have in your <A NAME="64"></A>left hand under your cloak, for that roll,
as I suspect, is the actual discourse. Now, much <A NAME="65"></A>as I
love you, I would not have you suppose that I am going to have your memory
exercised at <A NAME="66"></A>my expense, if you have Lysias himself here.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Enough; I see that I have no hope of practising my art upon
you. But <A NAME="68"></A>if I am to read, where would you please to sit?
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Let us turn aside and go by the Ilissus; we will sit down at
some quiet <A NAME="70"></A>spot. <A NAME="71"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I am fortunate in not having my sandals, and as you never
have any, <A NAME="72"></A>I think that we may go along the brook and cool
our feet in the water; this will be the easiest <A NAME="73"></A>way, and
at midday and in the summer is far from being unpleasant. <A NAME="74"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Lead on, and look out for a place in which we can sit down.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Do you see the tallest plane-tree in the distance? <A NAME="76"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes. <A NAME="77"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> There are shade and gentle breezes, and grass on which we
may either <A NAME="78"></A>sit or lie down. <A NAME="79"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Move forward. <A NAME="80"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I should like to know, Socrates, whether the place is not
somewhere <A NAME="81"></A>here at which Boreas is said to have carried
off Orithyia from the banks of the Ilissus? <A NAME="82"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Such is the tradition. <A NAME="83"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> And is this the exact spot? The little stream is delightfully
clear <A NAME="84"></A>and bright; I can fancy that there might be maidens
playing near. <A NAME="85"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I believe that the spot is not exactly here, but about a quarter
of a mile <A NAME="86"></A>lower down, where you cross to the temple of
Artemis, and there is, I think, some sort of an <A NAME="87"></A>altar
of Boreas at the place. <A NAME="88"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I have never noticed it; but I beseech you to tell me, Socrates,
do <A NAME="89"></A>you believe this tale? <A NAME="90"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The wise are doubtful, and I should not be singular if, like
them, I too <A NAME="91"></A>doubted. I might have a rational explanation
that Orithyia was playing with Pharmacia, when <A NAME="92"></A>a northern
gust carried her over the neighbouring rocks; and this being the manner
of her death, <A NAME="93"></A>she was said to have been carried away by
Boreas. There is a discrepancy, however, about the <A NAME="94"></A>locality;
according to another version of the story she was taken from Areopagus,
and not from <A NAME="95"></A>this place. Now I quite acknowledge that
these allegories are very nice, but he is not to be <A NAME="96"></A>envied
who has to invent them; much labour and ingenuity will be required of him;
and when <A NAME="97"></A>he has once begun, he must go on and rehabilitate
Hippocentaurs and chimeras dire. Gorgons <A NAME="98"></A>and winged steeds
flow in apace, and numberless other inconceivable and portentous natures.
<A NAME="99"></A>And if he is sceptical about them, and would fain reduce
them one after another to the rules <A NAME="100"></A>of probability, this
sort of crude philosophy will take up a great deal of time. Now I have
<A NAME="101"></A>no leisure for such enquiries; shall I tell you why?
I must first know myself, as the Delphian <A NAME="102"></A>inscription
says; to be curious about that which is not my concern, while I am still
in ignorance <A NAME="103"></A>of my own self, would be ridiculous. And
therefore I bid farewell to all this; the common opinion <A NAME="104"></A>is
enough for me. For, as I was saying, I want to know not about this, but
about myself: am <A NAME="105"></A>I a monster more complicated and swollen
with passion than the serpent Typho, or a creature <A NAME="106"></A>of
a gentler and simpler sort, to whom Nature has given a diviner and lowlier
destiny? But <A NAME="107"></A>let me ask you, friend: have we not reached
the plane-tree to which you were conducting us? <A NAME="108"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, this is the tree. <A NAME="109"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> By Here, a fair resting-place, full of summer sounds and scents.
Here is <A NAME="110"></A>this lofty and spreading plane-tree, and the
agnus cast us high and clustering, in the fullest <A NAME="111"></A>blossom
and the greatest fragrance; and the stream which flows beneath the plane-tree
is deliciously <A NAME="112"></A>cold to the feet. Judging from the ornaments
and images, this must be a spot sacred to Achelous <A NAME="113"></A>and
the Nymphs. How delightful is the breeze:-so very sweet; and there is a
sound in the air <A NAME="114"></A>shrill and summerlike which makes answer
to the chorus of the cicadae. But the greatest charm <A NAME="115"></A>of
all is the grass, like a pillow gently sloping to the head. My dear Phaedrus,
you have been <A NAME="116"></A>an admirable guide. <A NAME="117"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What an incomprehensible being you are, Socrates: when you
are in the <A NAME="118"></A>country, as you say, you really are like some
stranger who is led about by a guide. Do you <A NAME="119"></A>ever cross
the border? I rather think that you never venture even outside the gates.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Very true, my good friend; and I hope that you will excuse
me when you <A NAME="121"></A>hear the reason, which is, that I am a lover
of knowledge, and the men who dwell in the city <A NAME="122"></A>are my
teachers, and not the trees or the country. Though I do indeed believe
that you have <A NAME="123"></A>found a spell with which to draw me out
of the city into the country, like a hungry cow before <A NAME="124"></A>whom
a bough or a bunch of fruit is waved. For only hold up before me in like
manner a book, <A NAME="125"></A>and you may lead me all round Attica,
and over the wide world. And now having arrived, I intend <A NAME="126"></A>to
lie down, and do you choose any posture in which you can read best. Begin.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Listen. You know how matters stand with me; and how, as
I conceive, <A NAME="128"></A>this affair may be arranged for the advantage
of both of us. And I maintain that I ought not <A NAME="129"></A>to fail
in my suit, because I am not your lover: for lovers repent of the kindnesses
which <A NAME="130"></A>they have shown when their passion ceases, but
to the non-lovers who are free and not under <A NAME="131"></A>any compulsion,
no time of repentance ever comes; for they confer their benefits according
<A NAME="132"></A>to the measure of their ability, in the way which is
most conducive to their own interest. <A NAME="133"></A>Then again, lovers
consider how by reason of their love they have neglected their own concerns
<A NAME="134"></A>and rendered service to others: and when to these benefits
conferred they add on the troubles <A NAME="135"></A>which they have endured,
they think that they have long ago made to the beloved a very ample <A NAME="136"></A>return.
But the non-lover has no such tormenting recollections; he has never neglected
his <A NAME="137"></A>affairs or quarrelled with his relations; he has
no troubles to add up or excuse to invent; <A NAME="138"></A>and being
well rid of all these evils, why should he not freely do what will gratify
the beloved? <A NAME="139"></A><BR>
<BR>
If you say that the lover is more to be esteemed, because his love is thought
to be <A NAME="140"></A>greater; for he is willing to say and do what is
hateful to other men, in order to please his <A NAME="141"></A>beloved;-that,
if true, is only a proof that he will prefer any future love to his present,
<A NAME="142"></A>and will injure his old love at the pleasure of the new.
And how, in a matter of such infinite <A NAME="143"></A>importance, can
a man be right in trusting himself to one who is afflicted with a malady
which <A NAME="144"></A>no experienced person would attempt to cure, for
the patient himself admits that he is not <A NAME="145"></A>in his right
mind, and acknowledges that he is wrong in his mind, but says that he is
unable <A NAME="146"></A>to control himself? And if he came to his right
mind, would he ever imagine that the desires <A NAME="147"></A>were good
which he conceived when in his wrong mind? Once more, there are many more
non-lovers <A NAME="148"></A>than lovers; and if you choose the best of
the lovers, you will not have many to choose from; <A NAME="149"></A>but
if from the non-lovers, the choice will be larger, and you will be far
more likely to find <A NAME="150"></A>among them a person who is worthy
of your friendship. If public opinion be your dread, and <A NAME="151"></A>you
would avoid reproach, in all probability the lover, who is always thinking
that other men <A NAME="152"></A>are as emulous of him as he is of them,
will boast to some one of his successes, and make a <A NAME="153"></A>show
of them openly in the pride of his heart;-he wants others to know that
his labour has <A NAME="154"></A>not been lost; but the non-lover is more
his own master, and is desirous of solid good, and <A NAME="155"></A>not
of the opinion of mankind. Again, the lover may be generally noted or seen
following the <A NAME="156"></A>beloved (this is his regular occupation),
and whenever they are observed to exchange two words <A NAME="157"></A>they
are supposed to meet about some affair of love either past or in contemplation;
but when <A NAME="158"></A>non-lovers meet, no one asks the reason why,
because people know that talking to another is <A NAME="159"></A>natural,
whether friendship or mere pleasure be the motive. <A NAME="160"></A><BR>
<BR>
Once more, if you fear the fickleness of friendship, consider that in any
other case <A NAME="161"></A>a quarrel might be a mutual calamity; but
now, when you have given up what is most precious <A NAME="162"></A>to
you, you will be the greater loser, and therefore, you will have more reason
in being afraid <A NAME="163"></A>of the lover, for his vexations are many,
and he is always fancying that every one is leagued <A NAME="164"></A>against
him. Wherefore also he debars his beloved from society; he will not have
you intimate <A NAME="165"></A>with the wealthy, lest they should exceed
him in wealth, or with men of education, lest they <A NAME="166"></A>should
be his superiors in understanding; and he is equally afraid of anybody's
influence who <A NAME="167"></A>has any other advantage over himself. If
he can persuade you to break with them, you are left <A NAME="168"></A>without
friend in the world; or if, out of a regard to your own interest, you have
more sense <A NAME="169"></A>than to comply with his desire, you will have
to quarrel with him. But those who are non-lovers, <A NAME="170"></A>and
whose success in love is the reward of their merit, will not be jealous
of the companions <A NAME="171"></A>of their beloved, and will rather hate
those who refuse to be his associates, thinking that <A NAME="172"></A>their
favourite is slighted by the latter and benefited by the former; for more
love than hatred <A NAME="173"></A>may be expected to come to him out of
his friendship with others. Many lovers too have loved <A NAME="174"></A>the
person of a youth before they knew his character or his belongings; so
that when their <A NAME="175"></A>passion has passed away, there is no
knowing whether they will continue to be his friends; <A NAME="176"></A>whereas,
in the case of non-lovers who were always friends, the friendship is not
lessened <A NAME="177"></A>by the favours granted; but the recollection
of these remains with them, and is an earnest <A NAME="178"></A>of good
things to come. <A NAME="179"></A><BR>
<BR>
Further, I say that you are likely to be improved by me, whereas the lover
will spoil <A NAME="180"></A>you. For they praise your words and actions
in a wrong way; partly, because they are afraid <A NAME="181"></A>of offending
you, and also, their judgment is weakened by passion. Such are the feats
which <A NAME="182"></A>love exhibits; he makes things painful to the disappointed
which give no pain to others; he <A NAME="183"></A>compels the successful
lover to praise what ought not to give him pleasure, and therefore the
<A NAME="184"></A>beloved is to be pitied rather than envied. But if you
listen to me, in the first place, I, <A NAME="185"></A>in my intercourse
with you, shall not merely regard present enjoyment, but also future advantage,
<A NAME="186"></A>being not mastered by love, but my own master; nor for
small causes taking violent dislikes, <A NAME="187"></A>but even when the
cause is great, slowly laying up little wrath-unintentional offences I
shall <A NAME="188"></A>forgive, and intentional ones I shall try to prevent;
and these are the marks of a friendship <A NAME="189"></A>which will last.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>
<BR>
Do you think that a lover only can be a firm friend? reflect:-if this were
true, we <A NAME="191"></A>should set small value on sons, or fathers,
or mothers; nor should we ever have loyal friends, <A NAME="192"></A>for
our love of them arises not from passion, but from other associations.
Further, if we ought <A NAME="193"></A>to shower favours on those who are
the most eager suitors,-on that principle, we ought always <A NAME="194"></A>to
do good, not to the most virtuous, but to the most needy; for they are
the persons who will <A NAME="195"></A>be most relieved, and will therefore
be the most grateful; and when you make a feast you should <A NAME="196"></A>invite
not your friend, but the beggar and the empty soul; for they will love
you, and attend <A NAME="197"></A>you, and come about your doors, and will
be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and will <A NAME="198"></A>invoke
many a blessing on your head. Yet surely you ought not to be granting favours
to those <A NAME="199"></A>who besiege you with prayer, but to those who
are best able to reward you; nor to the lover <A NAME="200"></A>only, but
to those who are worthy of love; nor to those who will enjoy the bloom
of your youth, <A NAME="201"></A>but to those who will share their possessions
with you in age; nor to those who, having succeeded, <A NAME="202"></A>will
glory in their success to others, but to those who will be modest and tell
no tales; nor <A NAME="203"></A>to those who care about you for a moment
only, but to those who will continue your friends <A NAME="204"></A>through
life; nor to those who, when their passion is over, will pick a quarrel
with you, but <A NAME="205"></A>rather to those who, when the charm of
youth has left you, will show their own virtue. Remember <A NAME="206"></A>what
I have said; and consider yet this further point: friends admonish the
lover under the <A NAME="207"></A>idea that his way of life is bad, but
no one of his kindred ever yet censured the non-lover, <A NAME="208"></A>or
thought that he was ill-advised about his own interests. <A NAME="209"></A><BR>
<BR>
&quot;Perhaps you will ask me whether I propose that you should indulge
every non-lover. <A NAME="210"></A>To which I reply that not even the lover
would advise you to indulge all lovers, for the indiscriminate <A NAME="211"></A>favour
is less esteemed by the rational recipient, and less easily hidden by him
who would <A NAME="212"></A>escape the censure of the world. Now love ought
to be for the advantage of both parties, and <A NAME="213"></A>for the
injury of neither. <A NAME="214"></A><BR>
<BR>
&quot;I believe that I have said enough; but if there is anything more
which you desire <A NAME="215"></A>or which in your opinion needs to be
supplied, ask and I will answer.&quot; <A NAME="216"></A><BR>
<BR>
Now, Socrates, what do you think? Is not the discourse excellent, more
especially in <A NAME="217"></A>the matter of the language? <A NAME="218"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes, quite admirable; the effect on me was ravishing. And this
I owe to <A NAME="219"></A>you, Phaedrus, for I observed you while reading
to be in an ecstasy, and thinking that you <A NAME="220"></A>are more experienced
in these matters than I am, I followed your example, and, like you, my
<A NAME="221"></A>divine darling, I became inspired with a phrenzy. <A NAME="222"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Indeed, you are pleased to be merry. <A NAME="223"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Do you mean that I am not in earnest? <A NAME="224"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Now don't talk in that way, Socrates, but let me have your
real opinion; <A NAME="225"></A>I adjure you, by Zeus, the god of friendship,
to tell me whether you think that any Hellene <A NAME="226"></A>could have
said more or spoken better on the same subject. <A NAME="227"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Well, but are you and I expected to praise the sentiments of
the author, <A NAME="228"></A>or only the clearness, and roundness, and
finish, and tournure of the language? As to the first <A NAME="229"></A>I
willingly submit to your better judgment, for I am not worthy to form an
opinion, having <A NAME="230"></A>only attended to the rhetorical manner;
and I was doubting whether this could have been defended <A NAME="231"></A>even
by Lysias himself; I thought, though I speak under correction, that he
repeated himself <A NAME="232"></A>two or three times, either from want
of words or from want of pains; and also, he appeared <A NAME="233"></A>to
me ostentatiously to exult in showing how well he could say the same thing
in two or three <A NAME="234"></A>ways. <A NAME="235"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Nonsense, Socrates; what you call repetition was the especial
merit <A NAME="236"></A>of the speech; for he omitted no topic of which
the subject rightly allowed, and I do not think <A NAME="237"></A>that
any one could have spoken better or more exhaustively. <A NAME="238"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> There I cannot go along with you. Ancient sages, men and women,
who have <A NAME="239"></A>spoken and written of these things, would rise
up in judgment against me, if out of complaisance <A NAME="240"></A>I assented
to you. <A NAME="241"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Who are they, and where did you hear anything better than
this? <A NAME="242"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I am sure that I must have heard; but at this moment I do not
remember <A NAME="243"></A>from whom; perhaps from Sappho the fair, or
Anacreon the wise; or, possibly, from a prose writer. <A NAME="244"></A>Why
do I say so? Why, because I perceive that my bosom is full, and that I
could make another <A NAME="245"></A>speech as good as that of Lysias,
and different. Now I am certain that this is not an invention <A NAME="246"></A>of
my own, who am well aware that I know nothing, and therefore I can only
infer that I have <A NAME="247"></A>been filled through the cars, like
a pitcher, from the waters of another, though I have actually <A NAME="248"></A>forgotten
in my stupidity who was my informant. <A NAME="249"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That is grand:-but never mind where you beard the discourse
or from <A NAME="250"></A>whom; let that be a mystery not to be divulged
even at my earnest desire. Only, as you say, <A NAME="251"></A>promise
to make another and better oration, equal in length and entirely new, on
the same subject; <A NAME="252"></A>and I, like the nine Archons, will
promise to set up a golden image at Delphi, not only of <A NAME="253"></A>myself,
but of you, and as large as life. <A NAME="254"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> You are a dear golden ass if you suppose me to mean that Lysias
has altogether <A NAME="255"></A>missed the mark, and that I can make a
speech from which all his arguments are to be excluded. <A NAME="256"></A>The
worst of authors will say something which is to the point. Who, for example,
could speak <A NAME="257"></A>on this thesis of yours without praising
the discretion of the non-lover and blaming the indiscretion <A NAME="258"></A>of
the lover? These are the commonplaces of the subject which must come in
(for what else is <A NAME="259"></A>there to be said?) and must be allowed
and excused; the only merit is in the arrangement of <A NAME="260"></A>them,
for there can be none in the invention; but when you leave the commonplaces,
then there <A NAME="261"></A>may be some originality. <A NAME="262"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I admit that there is reason in what you say, and I too
will be reasonable, <A NAME="263"></A>and will allow you to start with
the premiss that the lover is more disordered in his wits <A NAME="264"></A>than
the non-lover; if in what remains you make a longer and better speech than
Lysias, and <A NAME="265"></A>use other arguments, then I say again, that
a statue you shall have of beaten gold, and take <A NAME="266"></A>your
place by the colossal offerings of the Cypselids at Olympia. <A NAME="267"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> How profoundly in earnest is the lover, because to tease him
I lay a finger <A NAME="268"></A>upon his love! And so, Phaedrus, you really
imagine that I am going to improve upon the ingenuity <A NAME="269"></A>of
Lysias? <A NAME="270"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> There I have you as you had me, and you must just speak
&quot;as you best <A NAME="271"></A>can.&quot; Do not let us exchange &quot;tu
quoque&quot; as in a farce, or compel me to say to you as you said <A NAME="272"></A>to
me, &quot;I know Socrates as well as I know myself, and he was wanting
to, speak, but he gave <A NAME="273"></A>himself airs.&quot; Rather I would
have you consider that from this place we stir not until you <A NAME="274"></A>have
unbosomed yourself of the speech; for here are we all alone, and I am stronger,
remember, <A NAME="275"></A>and younger than you-Wherefore perpend, and
do not compel me to use violence. <A NAME="276"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> But, my sweet Phaedrus, how ridiculous it would be of me to
compete with <A NAME="277"></A>Lysias in an extempore speech! He is a master
in his art and I am an untaught man. <A NAME="278"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> You see how matters stand; and therefore let there be no
more pretences; <A NAME="279"></A>for, indeed, I know the word that is
irresistible. <A NAME="280"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then don't say it. <A NAME="281"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, but I will; and my word shall be an oath. &quot;I say,
or rather swear&quot;-but <A NAME="282"></A>what god will be witness of
my oath?-&quot;By this plane-tree I swear, that unless you repeat the <A NAME="283"></A>discourse
here in the face of this very plane-tree, I will never tell you another;
never let <A NAME="284"></A>you have word of another!&quot; <A NAME="285"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Villain I am conquered; the poor lover of discourse has no
more to say. <A NAME="286"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Then why are you still at your tricks? <A NAME="287"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I am not going to play tricks now that you have taken the oath,
for I cannot <A NAME="288"></A>allow myself to be starved. <A NAME="289"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Proceed. <A NAME="290"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Shall I tell you what I will do? <A NAME="291"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What? <A NAME="292"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I will veil my face and gallop through the discourse as fast
as I can, <A NAME="293"></A>for if I see you I shall feel ashamed and not
know what to say. <A NAME="294"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Only go on and you may do anything else which you please.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Come, O ye Muses, melodious, as ye are called, whether you
have received <A NAME="296"></A>this name from the character of your strains,
or because the Melians are a musical race, help, <A NAME="297"></A>O help
me in the tale which my good friend here desires me to rehearse, in order
that his friend <A NAME="298"></A>whom he always deemed wise may seem to
him to be wiser than ever. <A NAME="299"></A><BR>
<BR>
Once upon a time there was a fair boy, or, more properly speaking, a youth;
he was <A NAME="300"></A>very fair and had a great many lovers; and there
was one special cunning one, who had persuaded <A NAME="301"></A>the youth
that he did not love him, but he really loved him all the same; and one
day when <A NAME="302"></A>he was paying his addresses to him, he used
this very argument-that he ought to accept the <A NAME="303"></A>non-lover
rather than the lover; his words were as follows:- <A NAME="304"></A><BR>
<BR>
&quot;All good counsel begins in the same way; a man should know what he
is advising about, <A NAME="305"></A>or his counsel will all come to nought.
But people imagine that they know about the nature <A NAME="306"></A>of
things, when they don't know about them, and, not having come to an understanding
at first <A NAME="307"></A>because they think that they know, they end,
as might be expected, in contradicting one another <A NAME="308"></A>and
themselves. Now you and I must not be guilty of this fundamental error
which we condemn <A NAME="309"></A>in others; but as our question is whether
the lover or non-lover is to be preferred, let us <A NAME="310"></A>first
of all agree in defining the nature and power of love, and then, keeping
our eyes upon <A NAME="311"></A>the definition and to this appealing, let
us further enquire whether love brings advantage <A NAME="312"></A>or disadvantage.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>
<BR>
&quot;Every one sees that love is a desire, and we know also that non-lovers
desire the <A NAME="314"></A>beautiful and good. Now in what way is the
lover to be distinguished from the non-lover? Let <A NAME="315"></A>us
note that in every one of us there are two guiding and ruling principles
which lead us whither <A NAME="316"></A>they will; one is the natural desire
of pleasure, the other is an acquired opinion which aspires <A NAME="317"></A>after
the best; and these two are sometimes in harmony and then again at war,
and sometimes <A NAME="318"></A>the one, sometimes the other conquers.
When opinion by the help of reason leads us to the best, <A NAME="319"></A>the
conquering principle is called temperance; but when desire, which is devoid
of reason, <A NAME="320"></A>rules in us and drags us to pleasure, that
power of misrule is called excess. Now excess has <A NAME="321"></A>many
names, and many members, and many forms, and any of these forms when very
marked gives <A NAME="322"></A>a name, neither honourable nor creditable,
to the bearer of the name. The desire of eating, <A NAME="323"></A>for
example, which gets the better of the higher reason and the other desires,
is called gluttony, <A NAME="324"></A>and he who is possessed by it is
called a glutton-I the tyrannical desire of drink, which inclines <A NAME="325"></A>the
possessor of the desire to drink, has a name which is only too obvious,
and there can be <A NAME="326"></A>as little doubt by what name any other
appetite of the same family would be called;-it will <A NAME="327"></A>be
the name of that which happens to be eluminant. And now I think that you
will perceive the <A NAME="328"></A>drift of my discourse; but as every
spoken word is in a manner plainer than the unspoken, I <A NAME="329"></A>had
better say further that the irrational desire which overcomes the tendency
of opinion towards <A NAME="330"></A>right, and is led away to the enjoyment
of beauty, and especially of personal beauty, by the <A NAME="331"></A>desires
which are her own kindred-that supreme desire, I say, which by leading
conquers and <A NAME="332"></A>by the force of passion is reinforced, from
this very force, receiving a name, is called love.&quot; <A NAME="333"></A><BR>
<BR>
And now, dear Phaedrus, I shall pause for an instant to ask whether you
do not think <A NAME="334"></A>me, as I appear to myself, inspired? <A NAME="335"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, Socrates, you seem to have a very unusual flow of words.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Listen to me, then, in silence; for surely the place is holy;
so that you <A NAME="337"></A>must not wonder, if, as I proceed, I appear
to be in a divine fury, for already I am getting <A NAME="338"></A>into
dithyrambics. <A NAME="339"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Nothing can be truer. <A NAME="340"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The responsibility rests with you. But hear what follows, and
Perhaps the <A NAME="341"></A>fit may be averted; all is in their hands
above. I will go on talking to my youth. Listen: <A NAME="342"></A><BR>
<BR>
Thus, my friend, we have declared and defined the nature of the subject.
Keeping the <A NAME="343"></A>definition in view, let us now enquire what
advantage or disadvantage is likely to ensue from <A NAME="344"></A>the
lover or the non-lover to him who accepts their advances. <A NAME="345"></A><BR>
<BR>
He who is the victim of his passions and the slave of pleasure will of
course desire <A NAME="346"></A>to make his beloved as agreeable to himself
as possible. Now to him who has a mind discased <A NAME="347"></A>anything
is agreeable which is not opposed to him, but that which is equal or superior
is hateful <A NAME="348"></A>to him, and therefore the lover Will not brook
any superiority or equality on the part of his <A NAME="349"></A>beloved;
he is always employed in reducing him to inferiority. And the ignorant
is the inferior <A NAME="350"></A>of the wise, the coward of the brave,
the slow of speech of the speaker, the dull of the clever. <A NAME="351"></A>These,
and not these only, are the mental defects of the beloved;-defects which,
when implanted <A NAME="352"></A>by nature, are necessarily a delight to
the lover, and when not implanted, he must contrive <A NAME="353"></A>to
implant them in him, if he would not be deprived of his fleeting joy. And
therefore he cannot <A NAME="354"></A>help being jealous, and will debar
his beloved from the advantages of society which would make <A NAME="355"></A>a
man of him, and especially from that society which would have given him
wisdom, and thereby <A NAME="356"></A>he cannot fail to do him great harm.
That is to say, in his excessive fear lest he should come <A NAME="357"></A>to
be despised in his eyes he will be compelled to banish from him divine
philosophy; and there <A NAME="358"></A>is no greater injury which he can
inflict upon him than this. He will contrive that his beloved <A NAME="359"></A>shall
be wholly ignorant, and in everything shall look to him; he is to be the
delight of the <A NAME="360"></A>lover's heart, and a curse to himself.
Verily, a lover is a profitable guardian and associate <A NAME="361"></A>for
him in all that relates to his mind. <A NAME="362"></A><BR>
<BR>
Let us next see how his master, whose law of life is pleasure and not good,
will keep <A NAME="363"></A>and train the body of his servant. Will he
not choose a beloved who is delicate rather than <A NAME="364"></A>sturdy
and strong? One brought up in shady bowers and not in the bright sun, a
stranger to <A NAME="365"></A>manly exercises and the sweat of toil, accustomed
only to a soft and luxurious diet, instead <A NAME="366"></A>of the hues
of health having the colours of paint and ornament, and the rest of a piece?-such
<A NAME="367"></A>a life as any one can imagine and which I need not detail
at length. But I may sum up all that <A NAME="368"></A>I have to say in
a word, and pass on. Such a person in war, or in any of the great crises
of <A NAME="369"></A>life, will be the anxiety of his friends and also
of his lover, and certainly not the terror <A NAME="370"></A>of his enemies;
which nobody can deny. <A NAME="371"></A><BR>
<BR>
And now let us tell what advantage or disadvantage the beloved will receive
from the <A NAME="372"></A>guardianship and society of his lover in the
matter of his property; this is the next point <A NAME="373"></A>to be
considered. The lover will be the first to see what, indeed, will be sufficiently
evident <A NAME="374"></A>to all men, that he desires above all things
to deprive his beloved of his dearest and best <A NAME="375"></A>and holiest
possessions, father, mother, kindred, friends, of all whom he thinks may
be hinderers <A NAME="376"></A>or reprovers of their most sweet converse;
he will even cast a jealous eye upon his gold and <A NAME="377"></A>silver
or other property, because these make him a less easy prey, and when caught
less manageable; <A NAME="378"></A>hence he is of necessity displeased
at his possession of them and rejoices at their loss; and <A NAME="379"></A>he
would like him to be wifeless, childless, homeless, as well; and the longer
the better, <A NAME="380"></A>for the longer he is all this, the longer
he will enjoy him. <A NAME="381"></A><BR>
<BR>
There are some soft of animals, such as flatterers, who are dangerous and,
mischievous <A NAME="382"></A>enough, and yet nature has mingled a temporary
pleasure and grace in their composition. You <A NAME="383"></A>may say
that a courtesan is hurtful, and disapprove of such creatures and their
practices, <A NAME="384"></A>and yet for the time they are very pleasant.
But the lover is not only hurtful to his love; <A NAME="385"></A>he is
also an extremely disagreeable companion. The old proverb says that &quot;birds
of a feather <A NAME="386"></A>flock together&quot;; I suppose that equality
of years inclines them to the same pleasures, and <A NAME="387"></A>similarity
begets friendship; yet you may have more than enough even of this; and
verily constraint <A NAME="388"></A>is always said to be grievous. Now
the lover is not only unlike his beloved, but he forces <A NAME="389"></A>himself
upon him. For he is old and his love is young, and neither day nor night
will he leave <A NAME="390"></A>him if he can help; necessity and the sting
of desire drive him on, and allure him with the <A NAME="391"></A>pleasure
which he receives from seeing, hearing, touching, perceiving him in every
way. And <A NAME="392"></A>therefore he is delighted to fasten upon him
and to minister to him. But what pleasure or consolation <A NAME="393"></A>can
the beloved be receiving all this time? Must he not feel the extremity
of disgust when <A NAME="394"></A>he looks at an old shrivelled face and
the remainder to match, which even in a description <A NAME="395"></A>is
disagreeable, and quite detestable when he is forced into daily contact
with his lover; <A NAME="396"></A>moreover he is jealously watched and
guarded against everything and everybody, and has to hear <A NAME="397"></A>misplaced
and exaggerated praises of himself, and censures equally inappropriate,
which are <A NAME="398"></A>intolerable when the man is sober, and, besides
being intolerable, are published all over the <A NAME="399"></A>world in
all their indelicacy and wearisomeness when he is drunk. <A NAME="400"></A><BR>
<BR>
And not only while his love continues is he mischievous and unpleasant,
but when his <A NAME="401"></A>love ceases he becomes a perfidious enemy
of him on whom he showered his oaths and prayers <A NAME="402"></A>and
promises, and yet could hardly prevail upon him to tolerate the tedium
of his company even <A NAME="403"></A>from motives of interest. The hour
of payment arrives, and now he is the servant of another <A NAME="404"></A>master;
instead of love and infatuation, wisdom and temperance are his bosom's
lords; but the <A NAME="405"></A>beloved has not discovered the change
which has taken place in him, when he asks for a return <A NAME="406"></A>and
recalls to his recollection former sayings and doings; he believes himself
to be speaking <A NAME="407"></A>to the same person, and the other, not
having the courage to confess the truth, and not knowing <A NAME="408"></A>how
to fulfil the oaths and promises which he made when under the dominion
of folly, and having <A NAME="409"></A>now grown wise and temperate, does
not want to do as he did or to be as he was before. And <A NAME="410"></A>so
he runs away and is constrained to be a defaulter; the oyster-shell has
fallen with the <A NAME="411"></A>other side uppermost-he changes pursuit
into flight, while the other is compelled to follow <A NAME="412"></A>him
with passion and imprecation not knowing that he ought never from the first
to have accepted <A NAME="413"></A>a demented lover instead of a sensible
non-lover; and that in making such a choice he was giving <A NAME="414"></A>himself
up to a faithless, morose, envious, disagreeable being, hurtful to his
estate, hurtful <A NAME="415"></A>to his bodily health, and still more
hurtful to the cultivation of his mind, than which there <A NAME="416"></A>neither
is nor ever will be anything more honoured in the eyes both of gods and
men. Consider <A NAME="417"></A>this, fair youth, and know that in the
friendship of the lover there is no real kindness; he <A NAME="418"></A>has
an appetite and wants to feed upon you: <A NAME="419"></A><BR>
<BR>
As wolves love lambs so lovers love their loves. <A NAME="420"></A><BR>
<BR>
But I told you so, I am speaking in verse, and therefore I had better make
an end; <A NAME="421"></A>enough. <A NAME="422"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I thought that you were only halfway and were going to make
a similar <A NAME="423"></A>speech about all the advantages of accepting
the non-lover. Why do you not proceed? <A NAME="424"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Does not your simplicity observe that I have got out of dithyrambics
into <A NAME="425"></A>heroics, when only uttering a censure on the lover?
And if I am to add the praises of the non-lover, <A NAME="426"></A>what
will become of me? Do you not perceive that I am already overtaken by the
Nymphs to whom <A NAME="427"></A>you have mischievously exposed me? And
therefore will only add that the non-lover has all the <A NAME="428"></A>advantages
in which the lover is accused of being deficient. And now I will say no
more; there <A NAME="429"></A>has been enough of both of them. Leaving
the tale to its fate, I will cross the river and make <A NAME="430"></A>the
best of my way home, lest a worse thing be inflicted upon me by you. <A NAME="431"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Not yet, Socrates; not until the heat of the day has passed;
do you <A NAME="432"></A>not see that the hour is almost noon? there is
the midday sun standing still, as people say, <A NAME="433"></A>in the
meridian. Let us rather stay and talk over what has been said, and then
return in the <A NAME="434"></A>cool. <A NAME="435"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Your love of discourse, Phaedrus, is superhuman, simply marvellous,
and <A NAME="436"></A>I do not believe that there is any one of your contemporaries
who has either made or in one <A NAME="437"></A>way or another has compelled
others to make an equal number of speeches. I would except Simmias <A NAME="438"></A>the
Theban, but all the rest are far behind you. And now, I do verily believe
that you have <A NAME="439"></A>been the cause of another. <A NAME="440"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That is good news. But what do you mean? <A NAME="441"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I mean to say that as I was about to cross the stream the usual
sign was <A NAME="442"></A>given to me,-that sign which always forbids,
but never bids, me to do anything which I am going <A NAME="443"></A>to
do; and I thought that I heard a voice saying in my car that I had been
guilty of impiety, <A NAME="444"></A>and. that I must not go away until
I had made an atonement. Now I am a diviner, though not <A NAME="445"></A>a
very good one, but I have enough religion for my own use, as you might
say of a bad writer-his <A NAME="446"></A>writing is good enough for him;
and I am beginning to see that I was in error. O my friend, <A NAME="447"></A>how
prophetic is the human soul! At the time I had a sort of misgiving, and,
like Ibycus, &quot;I <A NAME="448"></A>was troubled; I feared that I might
be buying honour from men at the price of sinning against <A NAME="449"></A>the
gods.&quot; Now I recognize my error. <A NAME="450"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What error? <A NAME="451"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> That was a dreadful speech which you brought with you, and
you made me <A NAME="452"></A>utter one as bad. <A NAME="453"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> How so? <A NAME="454"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> It was foolish, I say,-to a certain extent, impious; can anything
be more <A NAME="455"></A>dreadful? <A NAME="456"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Nothing, if the speech was really such as you describe.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Well, and is not Eros the son of Aphrodite, and a god? <A NAME="458"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> So men say. <A NAME="459"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> But that was not acknowledged by Lysias in his speech, nor
by you in that <A NAME="460"></A>other speech which you by a charm drew
from my lips. For if love be, as he surely is, a divinity, <A NAME="461"></A>he
cannot be evil. Yet this was the error of both the speeches. There was
also a simplicity <A NAME="462"></A>about them which was refreshing; having
no truth or honesty in them, nevertheless they pretended <A NAME="463"></A>to
be something, hoping to succeed in deceiving the manikins of earth and
gain celebrity among <A NAME="464"></A>them. Wherefore I must have a purgation.
And I bethink me of an ancient purgation of mythological <A NAME="465"></A>error
which was devised, not by Homer, for he never had the wit to discover why
he was blind, <A NAME="466"></A>but by Stesichorus, who was a philosopher
and knew the reason why; and therefore, when he lost <A NAME="467"></A>his
eyes, for that was the penalty which was inflicted upon him for reviling
the lovely Helen, <A NAME="468"></A>he at once purged himself. And the
purgation was a recantation, which began thus,- <A NAME="469"></A><BR>
<BR>
False is that word of mine-the truth is that thou didst not embark in ships,
nor ever <A NAME="470"></A>go to the walls of Troy; and when he had completed
his poem, which is called &quot;the recantation,&quot; <A NAME="471"></A>immediately
his sight returned to him. Now I will be wiser than either Stesichorus
or Homer, <A NAME="472"></A>in that I am going to make my recantation for
reviling love before I suffer; and this I will <A NAME="473"></A>attempt,
not as before, veiled and ashamed, but with forehead bold and bare. <A NAME="474"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Nothing could be more agreeable to me than to hear you say
so. <A NAME="475"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Only think, my good Phaedrus, what an utter want of delicacy
was shown <A NAME="476"></A>in the two discourses; I mean, in my own and
in that which you recited out of the book. Would <A NAME="477"></A>not
any one who was himself of a noble and gentle nature, and who loved or
ever had loved a <A NAME="478"></A>nature like his own, when we tell of
the petty causes of lovers' jealousies, and of their exceeding <A NAME="479"></A>animosities,
and of the injuries which they do to their beloved, have imagined that
our ideas <A NAME="480"></A>of love were taken from some haunt of sailors
to which good manners were unknown-he would certainly <A NAME="481"></A>never
have admitted the justice of our censure? <A NAME="482"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I dare say not, Socrates. <A NAME="483"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Therefore, because I blush at the thought of this person, and
also because <A NAME="484"></A>I am afraid of Love himself, I desire to
wash the brine out of my ears with water from the <A NAME="485"></A>spring;
and I would counsel Lysias not to delay, but to write another discourse,
which shall <A NAME="486"></A>prove that ceteris paribus the lover ought
to be accepted rather than the non-lover. <A NAME="487"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Be assured that he shall. You shall speak the praises of
the lover, <A NAME="488"></A>and Lysias shall be compelled by me to write
another discourse on the same theme. <A NAME="489"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> You will be true to your nature in that, and therefore I believe
you. <A NAME="490"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Speak, and fear not. <A NAME="491"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> But where is the fair youth whom I was addressing before, and
who ought <A NAME="492"></A>to listen now; lest, if he hear me not, he
should accept a non-lover before he knows what he <A NAME="493"></A>is
doing? <A NAME="494"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> He is close at hand, and always at your service. <A NAME="495"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Know then, fair youth, that the former discourse was the word
of Phaedrus, <A NAME="496"></A>the son of Vain Man, who dwells in the city
of Myrrhina (Myrrhinusius). And this which I am <A NAME="497"></A>about
to utter is the recantation of Stesichorus the son of Godly Man (Euphemus),
who comes <A NAME="498"></A>from the town of Desire (Himera), and is to
the following effect: &quot;I told a lie when I said&quot; <A NAME="499"></A>that
the beloved ought to accept the non-lover when he might have the lover,
because the one <A NAME="500"></A>is sane, and the other mad. It might
be so if madness were simply an evil; but there is also <A NAME="501"></A>a
madness which is a divine gift, and the source of the chiefest blessings
granted to men. <A NAME="502"></A>For prophecy is a madness, and the prophetess
at Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona when <A NAME="503"></A>out of their
senses have conferred great benefits on Hellas, both in public and private
life, <A NAME="504"></A>but when in their senses few or none. And I might
also tell you how the Sibyl and other inspired <A NAME="505"></A>persons
have given to many an one many an intimation of the future which has saved
them from <A NAME="506"></A>falling. But it would be tedious to speak of
what every one knows. <A NAME="507"></A><BR>
<BR>
There will be more reason in appealing to the ancient inventors of names,
who would <A NAME="508"></A>never have connected prophecy (mantike) which
foretells the future and is the noblest of arts, <A NAME="509"></A>with
madness (manike), or called them both by the same name, if they had deemed
madness to <A NAME="510"></A>be a disgrace or dishonour;-they must have
thought that there was an inspired madness which <A NAME="511"></A>was
a noble thing; for the two words, mantike and manike, are really the same,
and the letter <A NAME="512"></A>t is only a modern and tasteless insertion.
And this is confirmed by the name which was given <A NAME="513"></A>by
them to the rational investigation of futurity, whether made by the help
of birds or of <A NAME="514"></A>other signs-this, for as much as it is
an art which supplies from the reasoning faculty mind <A NAME="515"></A>(nous)
and information (istoria) to human thought (oiesis) they originally termed
oionoistike, <A NAME="516"></A>but the word has been lately altered and
made sonorous by the modern introduction of the letter <A NAME="517"></A>Omega
(oionoistike and oionistike), and in proportion prophecy (mantike) is more
perfect and <A NAME="518"></A>august than augury, both in name and fact,
in the same proportion, as the ancients testify, <A NAME="519"></A>is madness
superior to a sane mind (sophrosune) for the one is only of human, but
the other <A NAME="520"></A>of divine origin. Again, where plagues and
mightiest woes have bred in certain families, owing <A NAME="521"></A>to
some ancient blood-guiltiness, there madness has entered with holy prayers
and rites, and <A NAME="522"></A>by inspired utterances found a way of
deliverance for those who are in need; and he who has <A NAME="523"></A>part
in this gift, and is truly possessed and duly out of his mind, is by the
use of purifications <A NAME="524"></A>and mysteries made whole and except
from evil, future as well as present, and has a release <A NAME="525"></A>from
the calamity which was afflicting him. The third kind is the madness of
those who are <A NAME="526"></A>possessed by the Muses; which taking hold
of a delicate and virgin soul, and there inspiring <A NAME="527"></A>frenzy,
awakens lyrical and all other numbers; with these adorning the myriad actions
of ancient <A NAME="528"></A>heroes for the instruction of posterity. But
he who, having no touch of the Muses' madness <A NAME="529"></A>in his
soul, comes to the door and thinks that he will get into the temple by
the help of art-he, <A NAME="530"></A>I say, and his poetry are not admitted;
the sane man disappears and is nowhere when he enters <A NAME="531"></A>into
rivalry with the madman. <A NAME="532"></A><BR>
<BR>
I might tell of many other noble deeds which have sprung from inspired
madness. And <A NAME="533"></A>therefore, let no one frighten or flutter
us by saying that the temperate friend is to be chosen <A NAME="534"></A>rather
than the inspired, but let him further show that love is not sent by the
gods for any <A NAME="535"></A>good to lover or beloved; if he can do so
we will allow him to carry off the palm. And we, <A NAME="536"></A>on our
part, will prove in answer to him that the madness of love is the greatest
of heaven's <A NAME="537"></A>blessings, and the proof shall be one which
the wise will receive, and the witling disbelieve. <A NAME="538"></A>But
first of all, let us view the affections and actions of the soul divine
and human, and <A NAME="539"></A>try to ascertain the truth about them.
The beginning of our proof is as follows:- <A NAME="540"></A><BR>
<BR>
The soul through all her being is immortal, for that which is ever in motion
is immortal; <A NAME="541"></A>but that which moves another and is moved
by another, in ceasing to move ceases also to live. <A NAME="542"></A>Only
the self-moving, never leaving self, never ceases to move, and is the fountain
and beginning <A NAME="543"></A>of motion to all that moves besides. Now,
the beginning is unbegotten, for that which is begotten <A NAME="544"></A>has
a beginning; but the beginning is begotten of nothing, for if it were begotten
of something, <A NAME="545"></A>then the begotten would not come from a
beginning. But if unbegotten, it must also be indestructible; <A NAME="546"></A>for
if beginning were destroyed, there could be no beginning out of anything,
nor anything <A NAME="547"></A>out of a beginning; and all things must
have a beginning. And therefore the self-moving is <A NAME="548"></A>the
beginning of motion; and this can neither be destroyed nor begotten, else
the whole heavens <A NAME="549"></A>and all creation would collapse and
stand still, and never again have motion or birth. But <A NAME="550"></A>if
the self-moving is proved to be immortal, he who affirms that self-motion
is the very idea <A NAME="551"></A>and essence of the soul will not be
put to confusion. For the body which is moved from without <A NAME="552"></A>is
soulless; but that which is moved from within has a soul, for such is the
nature of the <A NAME="553"></A>soul. But if this be true, must not the
soul be the self-moving, and therefore of necessity <A NAME="554"></A>unbegotten
and immortal? Enough of the soul's immortality. <A NAME="555"></A><BR>
<BR>
Of the nature of the soul, though her true form be ever a theme of large
and more than <A NAME="556"></A>mortal discourse, let me speak briefly,
and in a figure. And let the figure be composite-a <A NAME="557"></A>pair
of winged horses and a charioteer. Now the winged horses and the charioteers
of the gods <A NAME="558"></A>are all of them noble and of noble descent,
but those of other races are mixed; the human charioteer <A NAME="559"></A>drives
his in a pair; and one of them is noble and of noble breed, and the other
is ignoble <A NAME="560"></A>and of ignoble breed; and the driving of them
of necessity gives a great deal of trouble to <A NAME="561"></A>him. I
will endeavour to explain to you in what way the mortal differs from the
immortal creature. <A NAME="562"></A>The soul in her totality has the care
of inanimate being everywhere, and traverses the whole <A NAME="563"></A>heaven
in divers forms appearing--when perfect and fully winged she soars upward,
and orders <A NAME="564"></A>the whole world; whereas the imperfect soul,
losing her wings and drooping in her flight at <A NAME="565"></A>last settles
on the solid ground-there, finding a home, she receives an earthly frame
which <A NAME="566"></A>appears to be self-moved, but is really moved by
her power; and this composition of soul and <A NAME="567"></A>body is called
a living and mortal creature. For immortal no such union can be reasonably
believed <A NAME="568"></A>to be; although fancy, not having seen nor surely
known the nature of God, may imagine an immortal <A NAME="569"></A>creature
having both a body and also a soul which are united throughout all time.
Let that, <A NAME="570"></A>however, be as God wills, and be spoken of
acceptably to him. And now let us ask the reason <A NAME="571"></A>why
the soul loses her wings! <A NAME="572"></A><BR>
<BR>
The wing is the corporeal element which is most akin to the divine, and
which by nature <A NAME="573"></A>tends to soar aloft and carry that which
gravitates downwards into the upper region, which <A NAME="574"></A>is
the habitation of the gods. The divine is beauty, wisdom, goodness, and
the like; and by <A NAME="575"></A>these the wing of the soul is nourished,
and grows apace; but when fed upon evil and foulness <A NAME="576"></A>and
the opposite of good, wastes and falls away. Zeus, the mighty lord, holding
the reins of <A NAME="577"></A>a winged chariot, leads the way in heaven,
ordering all and taking care of all; and there follows <A NAME="578"></A>him
the array of gods and demigods, marshalled in eleven bands; Hestia alone
abides at home <A NAME="579"></A>in the house of heaven; of the rest they
who are reckoned among the princely twelve march in <A NAME="580"></A>their
appointed order. They see many blessed sights in the inner heaven, and
there are many <A NAME="581"></A>ways to and fro, along which the blessed
gods are passing, every one doing his own work; he <A NAME="582"></A>may
follow who will and can, for jealousy has no place in the celestial choir.
But when they <A NAME="583"></A>go to banquet and festival, then they move
up the steep to the top of the vault of heaven. <A NAME="584"></A>The chariots
of the gods in even poise, obeying the rein, glide rapidly; but the others
labour, <A NAME="585"></A>for the vicious steed goes heavily, weighing
down the charioteer to the earth when his steed <A NAME="586"></A>has not
been thoroughly trained:-and this is the hour of agony and extremest conflict
for the <A NAME="587"></A>soul. For the immortals, when they are at the
end of their course, go forth and stand upon <A NAME="588"></A>the outside
of heaven, and the revolution of the spheres carries them round, and they
behold <A NAME="589"></A>the things beyond. But of the heaven which is
above the heavens, what earthly poet ever did <A NAME="590"></A>or ever
will sing worthily? It is such as I will describe; for I must dare to speak
the truth, <A NAME="591"></A>when truth is my theme. There abides the very
being with which true knowledge is concerned; <A NAME="592"></A>the colourless,
formless, intangible essence, visible only to mind, the pilot of the soul.
<A NAME="593"></A>The divine intelligence, being nurtured upon mind and
pure knowledge, and the intelligence <A NAME="594"></A>of every soul which
is capable of receiving the food proper to it, rejoices at beholding reality,
<A NAME="595"></A>and once more gazing upon truth, is replenished and made
glad, until the revolution of the <A NAME="596"></A>worlds brings her round
again to the same place. In the revolution she beholds justice, and <A NAME="597"></A>temperance,
and knowledge absolute, not in the form of generation or of relation, which
men <A NAME="598"></A>call existence, but knowledge absolute in existence
absolute; and beholding the other true <A NAME="599"></A>existences in
like manner, and feasting upon them, she passes down into the interior
of the <A NAME="600"></A>heavens and returns home; and there the charioteer
putting up his horses at the stall, gives <A NAME="601"></A>them ambrosia
to eat and nectar to drink. <A NAME="602"></A><BR>
<BR>
Such is the life of the gods; but of other souls, that which follows God
best and is <A NAME="603"></A>likest to him lifts the head of the charioteer
into the outer world, and is carried round in <A NAME="604"></A>the revolution,
troubled indeed by the steeds, and with difficulty beholding true being;
while <A NAME="605"></A>another only rises and falls, and sees, and again
fails to see by reason of the unruliness <A NAME="606"></A>of the steeds.
The rest of the souls are also longing after the upper world and they all
follow, <A NAME="607"></A>but not being strong enough they are carried
round below the surface, plunging, treading on <A NAME="608"></A>one another,
each striving to be first; and there is confusion and perspiration and
the extremity <A NAME="609"></A>of effort; and many of them are lamed or
have their wings broken through the ill-driving of <A NAME="610"></A>the
charioteers; and all of them after a fruitless toil, not having attained
to the mysteries <A NAME="611"></A>of true being, go away, and feed upon
opinion. The reason why the souls exhibit this exceeding <A NAME="612"></A>eagerness
to behold the plain of truth is that pasturage is found there, which is
suited to <A NAME="613"></A>the highest part of the soul; and the wing
on which the soul soars is nourished with this. <A NAME="614"></A>And there
is a law of Destiny, that the soul which attains any vision of truth in
company with <A NAME="615"></A>a god is preserved from harm until the next
period, and if attaining always is always unharmed. <A NAME="616"></A>But
when she is unable to follow, and fails to behold the truth, and through
some ill-hap sinks <A NAME="617"></A>beneath the double load of forgetfulness
and vice, and her wings fall from her and she drops <A NAME="618"></A>to
the ground, then the law ordains that this soul shall at her first birth
pass, not into <A NAME="619"></A>any other animal, but only into man; and
the soul which has seen most of truth shall come to <A NAME="620"></A>the
birth as a philosopher, or artist, or some musical and loving nature; that
which has seen <A NAME="621"></A>truth in the second degree shall be some
righteous king or warrior chief; the soul which is <A NAME="622"></A>of
the third class shall be a politician, or economist, or trader; the fourth
shall be lover <A NAME="623"></A>of gymnastic toils, or a physician; the
fifth shall lead the life of a prophet or hierophant; <A NAME="624"></A>to
the sixth the character of poet or some other imitative artist will be
assigned; to the <A NAME="625"></A>seventh the life of an artisan or husbandman;
to the eighth that of a sophist or demagogue; <A NAME="626"></A>to the
ninth that of a tyrant-all these are states of probation, in which he who
does righteously <A NAME="627"></A>improves, and he who does unrighteously,
improves, and he who does unrighteously, deteriorates <A NAME="628"></A>his
lot. <A NAME="629"></A><BR>
<BR>
Ten thousand years must elapse before the soul of each one can return to
the place <A NAME="630"></A>from whence she came, for she cannot grow her
wings in less; only the soul of a philosopher, <A NAME="631"></A>guileless
and true, or the soul of a lover, who is not devoid of philosophy, may
acquire wings <A NAME="632"></A>in the third of the recurring periods of
a thousand years; he is distinguished from the ordinary <A NAME="633"></A>good
man who gains wings in three thousand years:-and they who choose this life
three times <A NAME="634"></A>in succession have wings given them, and
go away at the end of three thousand years. But the <A NAME="635"></A>others
receive judgment when they have completed their first life, and after the
judgment they <A NAME="636"></A>go, some of them to the houses of correction
which are under the earth, and are punished; others <A NAME="637"></A>to
some place in heaven whither they are lightly borne by justice, and there
they live in a <A NAME="638"></A>manner worthy of the life which they led
here when in the form of men. And at the end of the <A NAME="639"></A>first
thousand years the good souls and also the evil souls both come to draw
lots and choose <A NAME="640"></A>their second life, and they may take
any which they please. The soul of a man may pass into <A NAME="641"></A>the
life of a beast, or from the beast return again into the man. But the soul
which has never <A NAME="642"></A>seen the truth will not pass into the
human form. For a man must have intelligence of universals, <A NAME="643"></A>and
be able to proceed from the many particulars of sense to one conception
of reason;-this <A NAME="644"></A>is the recollection of those things which
our soul once saw while following God-when regardless <A NAME="645"></A>of
that which we now call being she raised her head up towards the true being.
And therefore <A NAME="646"></A>the mind of the philosopher alone has wings;
and this is just, for he is always, according <A NAME="647"></A>to the
measure of his abilities, clinging in recollection to those things in which
God abides, <A NAME="648"></A>and in beholding which He is what He is.
And he who employs aright these memories is ever being <A NAME="649"></A>initiated
into perfect mysteries and alone becomes truly perfect. But, as he forgets
earthly <A NAME="650"></A>interests and is rapt in the divine, the vulgar
deem him mad, and rebuke him; they do not see <A NAME="651"></A>that he
is inspired. <A NAME="652"></A><BR>
<BR>
Thus far I have been speaking of the fourth and last kind of madness, which
is imputed <A NAME="653"></A>to him who, when he sees the beauty of earth,
is transported with the recollection of the true <A NAME="654"></A>beauty;
he would like to fly away, but he cannot; he is like a bird fluttering
and looking <A NAME="655"></A>upward and careless of the world below; and
he is therefore thought to be mad. And I have shown <A NAME="656"></A>this
of all inspirations to be the noblest and highest and the offspring of
the highest to <A NAME="657"></A>him who has or shares in it, and that
he who loves the beautiful is called a lover because <A NAME="658"></A>he
partakes of it. For, as has been already said, every soul of man has in
the way of nature <A NAME="659"></A>beheld true being; this was the condition
of her passing into the form of man. But all souls <A NAME="660"></A>do
not easily recall the things of the other world; they may have seen them
for a short time <A NAME="661"></A>only, or they may have been unfortunate
in their earthly lot, and, having had their hearts <A NAME="662"></A>turned
to unrighteousness through some corrupting influence, they may have lost
the memory <A NAME="663"></A>of the holy things which once they saw. Few
only retain an adequate remembrance of them; and <A NAME="664"></A>they,
when they behold here any image of that other world, are rapt in amazement;
but they <A NAME="665"></A>are ignorant of what this rapture means, because
they do not clearly perceive. For there is <A NAME="666"></A>no light of
justice or temperance or any of the higher ideas which are precious to
souls in <A NAME="667"></A>the earthly copies of them: they are seen through
a glass dimly; and there are few who, going <A NAME="668"></A>to the images,
behold in them the realities, and these only with difficulty. There was
a time <A NAME="669"></A>when with the rest of the happy band they saw
beauty shining in brightness-we philosophers <A NAME="670"></A>following
in the train of Zeus, others in company with other gods; and then we beheld
the beatific <A NAME="671"></A>vision and were initiated into a mystery
which may be truly called most blessed, celebrated <A NAME="672"></A>by
us in our state of innocence, before we had any experience of evils to
come, when we were <A NAME="673"></A>admitted to the sight of apparitions
innocent and simple and calm and happy, which we beheld <A NAME="674"></A>shining
impure light, pure ourselves and not yet enshrined in that living tomb
which we carry <A NAME="675"></A>about, now that we are imprisoned in the
body, like an oyster in his shell. Let me linger over <A NAME="676"></A>the
memory of scenes which have passed away. <A NAME="677"></A><BR>
<BR>
But of beauty, I repeat again that we saw her there shining in company
with the celestial <A NAME="678"></A>forms; and coming to earth we find
her here too, shining in clearness through the clearest <A NAME="679"></A>aperture
of sense. For sight is the most piercing of our bodily senses; though not
by that <A NAME="680"></A>is wisdom seen; her loveliness would have been
transporting if there had been a visible image <A NAME="681"></A>of her,
and the other ideas, if they had visible counterparts, would be equally
lovely. But <A NAME="682"></A>this is the privilege of beauty, that being
the loveliest she is also the most palpable to <A NAME="683"></A>sight.
Now he who is not newly initiated or who has become corrupted, does not
easily rise <A NAME="684"></A>out of this world to the sight of true beauty
in the other; he looks only at her earthly namesake, <A NAME="685"></A>and
instead of being awed at the sight of her, he is given over to pleasure,
and like a brutish <A NAME="686"></A>beast he rushes on to enjoy and beget;
he consorts with wantonness, and is not afraid or ashamed <A NAME="687"></A>of
pursuing pleasure in violation of nature. But he whose initiation is recent,
and who has <A NAME="688"></A>been the spectator of many glories in the
other world, is amazed when he sees any one having <A NAME="689"></A>a
godlike face or form, which is the expression of divine beauty; and at
first a shudder runs <A NAME="690"></A>through him, and again the old awe
steals over him; then looking upon the face of his beloved <A NAME="691"></A>as
of a god he reverences him, and if he were not afraid of being thought
a downright madman, <A NAME="692"></A>he would sacrifice to his beloved
as to the image of a god; then while he gazes on him there <A NAME="693"></A>is
a sort of reaction, and the shudder passes into an unusual heat and perspiration;
for, as <A NAME="694"></A>he receives the effluence of beauty through the
eyes, the wing moistens and he warms. And as <A NAME="695"></A>he warms,
the parts out of which the wing grew, and which had been hitherto closed
and rigid, <A NAME="696"></A>and had prevented the wing from shooting forth,
are melted, and as nourishment streams upon <A NAME="697"></A>him, the
lower end of the wings begins to swell and grow from the root upwards;
and the growth <A NAME="698"></A>extends under the whole soul-for once
the whole was winged. <A NAME="699"></A><BR>
<BR>
During this process the whole soul is all in a state of ebullition and
effervescence,-which <A NAME="700"></A>may be compared to the irritation
and uneasiness in the gums at the time of cutting teeth,-bubbles <A NAME="701"></A>up,
and has a feeling of uneasiness and tickling; but when in like manner the
soul is beginning <A NAME="702"></A>to grow wings, the beauty of the beloved
meets her eye and she receives the sensible warm motion <A NAME="703"></A>of
particles which flow towards her, therefore called emotion (imeros), and
is refreshed and <A NAME="704"></A>warmed by them, and then she ceases
from her pain with joy. But when she is parted from her <A NAME="705"></A>beloved
and her moisture fails, then the orifices of the passage out of which the
wing shoots <A NAME="706"></A>dry up and close, and intercept the germ
of the wing; which, being shut up with the emotion, <A NAME="707"></A>throbbing
as with the pulsations of an artery, pricks the aperture which is nearest,
until <A NAME="708"></A>at length the entire soul is pierced and maddened
and pained, and at the recollection of beauty <A NAME="709"></A>is again
delighted. And from both of them together the soul is oppressed at the
strangeness <A NAME="710"></A>of her condition, and is in a great strait
and excitement, and in her madness can neither sleep <A NAME="711"></A>by
night nor abide in her place by day. And wherever she thinks that she will
behold the beautiful <A NAME="712"></A>one, thither in her desire she runs.
And when she has seen him, and bathed herself in the waters <A NAME="713"></A>of
beauty, her constraint is loosened, and she is refreshed, and has no more
pangs and pains; <A NAME="714"></A>and this is the sweetest of all pleasures
at the time, and is the reason why the soul of the <A NAME="715"></A>lover
will never forsake his beautiful one, whom he esteems above all; he has
forgotten mother <A NAME="716"></A>and brethren and companions, and he
thinks nothing of the neglect and loss of his property; <A NAME="717"></A>the
rules and proprieties of life, on which he formerly prided himself, he
now despises, and <A NAME="718"></A>is ready to sleep like a servant, wherever
he is allowed, as near as he can to his desired <A NAME="719"></A>one,
who is the object of his worship, and the physician who can alone assuage
the greatness <A NAME="720"></A>of his pain. And this state, my dear imaginary
youth to whom I am talking, is by men called <A NAME="721"></A>love, and
among the gods has a name at which you, in your simplicity, may be inclined
to mock; <A NAME="722"></A>there are two lines in the apocryphal writings
of Homer in which the name occurs. One of them <A NAME="723"></A>is rather
outrageous, and not altogether metrical. They are as follows: <A NAME="724"></A><BR>
<BR>
Mortals call him fluttering love, <A NAME="725"></A><BR>
But the immortals call him winged one, <A NAME="726"></A><BR>
Because the growing of wings is a necessity to him. You may believe this,
but not unless <A NAME="727"></A>you like. At any rate the loves of lovers
and their causes are such as I have described. <A NAME="728"></A><BR>
<BR>
Now the lover who is taken to be the attendant of Zeus is better able to
bear the winged <A NAME="729"></A>god, and can endure a heavier burden;
but the attendants and companions of Ares, when under <A NAME="730"></A>the
influence of love, if they fancy that they have been at all wronged, are
ready to kill <A NAME="731"></A>and put an end to themselves and their
beloved. And he who follows in the train of any other <A NAME="732"></A>god,
while he is unspoiled and the impression lasts, honours and imitates him,
as far as he <A NAME="733"></A>is able; and after the manner of his god
he behaves in his intercourse with his beloved and <A NAME="734"></A>with
the rest of the world during the first period of his earthly existence.
Every one chooses <A NAME="735"></A>his love from the ranks of beauty according
to his character, and this he makes his god, and <A NAME="736"></A>fashions
and adorns as a sort of image which he is to fall down and worship. The
followers <A NAME="737"></A>of Zeus desire that their beloved should have
a soul like him; and therefore they seek out <A NAME="738"></A>some one
of a philosophical and imperial nature, and when they have found him and
loved him, <A NAME="739"></A>they do all they can to confirm such a nature
in him, and if they have no experience of such <A NAME="740"></A>a disposition
hitherto, they learn of any one who can teach them, and themselves follow
in <A NAME="741"></A>the same way. And they have the less difficulty in
finding the nature of their own god in themselves, <A NAME="742"></A>because
they have been compelled to gaze intensely on him; their recollection clings
to him, <A NAME="743"></A>and they become possessed of him, and receive
from him their character and disposition, so <A NAME="744"></A>far as man
can participate in God. The qualities of their god they attribute to the
beloved, <A NAME="745"></A>wherefore they love him all the more, and if,
like the Bacchic Nymphs, they draw inspiration <A NAME="746"></A>from Zeus,
they pour out their own fountain upon him, wanting to make him as like
as possible <A NAME="747"></A>to their own god. But those who are the followers
of Here seek a royal love, and when they <A NAME="748"></A>have found him
they do just the same with him; and in like manner the followers of Apollo,
<A NAME="749"></A>and of every other god walking in the ways of their god,
seek a love who is to be made like <A NAME="750"></A>him whom they serve,
and when they have found him, they themselves imitate their god, and persuade
<A NAME="751"></A>their love to do the same, and educate him into the manner
and nature of the god as far as <A NAME="752"></A>they each can; for no
feelings of envy or jealousy are entertained by them towards their beloved,
<A NAME="753"></A>but they do their utmost to create in him the greatest
likeness of themselves and of the god <A NAME="754"></A>whom they honour.
Thus fair and blissful to the beloved is the desire of the inspired lover,
<A NAME="755"></A>and the initiation of which I speak into the mysteries
of true love, if he be captured by the <A NAME="756"></A>lover and their
purpose is effected. Now the beloved is taken captive in the following
manner:- <A NAME="757"></A><BR>
<BR>
As I said at the beginning of this tale, I divided each soul into three-two
horses <A NAME="758"></A>and a charioteer; and one of the horses was good
and the other bad: the division may remain, <A NAME="759"></A>but I have
not yet explained in what the goodness or badness of either consists, and
to that <A NAME="760"></A>I will proceed. The right-hand horse is upright
and cleanly made; he has a lofty neck and an <A NAME="761"></A>aquiline
nose; his colour is white, and his eyes dark; he is a lover of honour and
modesty <A NAME="762"></A>and temperance, and the follower of true glory;
he needs no touch of the whip, but is guided <A NAME="763"></A>by word
and admonition only. The other is a crooked lumbering animal, put together
anyhow; <A NAME="764"></A>he has a short thick neck; he is flat-faced and
of a dark colour, with grey eyes and blood-red <A NAME="765"></A>complexion;
the mate of insolence and pride, shag-eared and deaf, hardly yielding to
whip and <A NAME="766"></A>spur. Now when the charioteer beholds the vision
of love, and has his whole soul warmed through <A NAME="767"></A>sense,
and is full of the prickings and ticklings of desire, the obedient steed,
then as always <A NAME="768"></A>under the government of shame, refrains
from leaping on the beloved; but the other, heedless <A NAME="769"></A>of
the pricks and of the blows of the whip, plunges and runs away, giving
all manner of trouble <A NAME="770"></A>to his companion and the charioteer,
whom he forces to approach the beloved and to remember <A NAME="771"></A>the
joys of love. They at first indignantly oppose him and will not be urged
on to do terrible <A NAME="772"></A>and unlawful deeds; but at last, when
he persists in plaguing them, they yield and agree to <A NAME="773"></A>do
as he bids them. <A NAME="774"></A><BR>
<BR>
And now they are at the spot and behold the flashing beauty of the beloved;
which when <A NAME="775"></A>the charioteer sees, his memory is carried
to the true beauty, whom he beholds in company with <A NAME="776"></A>Modesty
like an image placed upon a holy pedestal. He sees her, but he is afraid
and falls <A NAME="777"></A>backwards in adoration, and by his fall is
compelled to pull back the reins with such violence <A NAME="778"></A>as
to bring both the steeds on their haunches, the one willing and unresisting,
the unruly <A NAME="779"></A>one very unwilling; and when they have gone
back a little, the one is overcome with shame and <A NAME="780"></A>wonder,
and his whole soul is bathed in perspiration; the other, when the pain
is over which <A NAME="781"></A>the bridle and the fall had given him,
having with difficulty taken breath, is full of wrath <A NAME="782"></A>and
reproaches, which he heaps upon the charioteer and his fellow-steed, for
want of courage <A NAME="783"></A>and manhood, declaring that they have
been false to their agreement and guilty of desertion. <A NAME="784"></A>Again
they refuse, and again he urges them on, and will scarce yield to their
prayer that he <A NAME="785"></A>would wait until another time. When the
appointed hour comes, they make as if they had forgotten, <A NAME="786"></A>and
he reminds them, fighting and neighing and dragging them on, until at length
he, on the <A NAME="787"></A>same thoughts intent, forces them to draw
near again. And when they are near he stoops his <A NAME="788"></A>head
and puts up his tail, and takes the bit in his teeth. and pulls shamelessly.
Then the <A NAME="789"></A>charioteer is. worse off than ever; he falls
back like a racer at the barrier, and with a still <A NAME="790"></A>more
violent wrench drags the bit out of the teeth of the wild steed and covers
his abusive <A NAME="791"></A>tongue and-jaws with blood, and forces his
legs and haunches to the ground and punishes him <A NAME="792"></A>sorely.
And when this has happened several times and the villain has ceased from
his wanton <A NAME="793"></A>way, he is tamed and humbled, and follows
the will of the charioteer, and when he sees the <A NAME="794"></A>beautiful
one he is ready to die of fear. And from that time forward the soul of
the lover <A NAME="795"></A>follows the beloved in modesty and holy fear.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>
<BR>
And so the beloved who, like a god, has received every true and loyal service
from <A NAME="797"></A>his lover, not in pretence but in reality, being
also himself of a nature friendly to his admirer, <A NAME="798"></A>if
in former days he has blushed to own his passion and turned away his lover,
because his <A NAME="799"></A>youthful companions or others slanderously
told him that he would be disgraced, now as years <A NAME="800"></A>advance,
at the appointed age and time, is led to receive him into communion. For
fate which <A NAME="801"></A>has ordained that there shall be no friendship
among the evil has also ordained that there <A NAME="802"></A>shall ever
be friendship among the good. And the beloved when he has received him
into communion <A NAME="803"></A>and intimacy, is quite amazed at the good-will
of the lover; he recognises that the inspired <A NAME="804"></A>friend
is worth all other friends or kinsmen; they have nothing of friendship
in them worthy <A NAME="805"></A>to be compared with his. And when his
feeling continues and he is nearer to him and embraces <A NAME="806"></A>him,
in gymnastic exercises and at other times of meeting, then the fountain
of that stream, <A NAME="807"></A>which Zeus when he was in love with Ganymede
named Desire, overflows upon the lover, and some <A NAME="808"></A>enters
into his soul, and some when he is filled flows out again; and as a breeze
or an echo <A NAME="809"></A>rebounds from the smooth rocks and returns
whence it came, so does the stream of beauty, passing <A NAME="810"></A>through
the eyes which are the windows of the soul, come back to the beautiful
one; there arriving <A NAME="811"></A>and quickening the passages of the
wings, watering. them and inclining them to grow, and filling <A NAME="812"></A>the
soul of the beloved also with love. And thus he loves, but he knows not
what; he does not <A NAME="813"></A>understand and cannot explain his own
state; he appears to have caught the infection of blindness <A NAME="814"></A>from
another; the lover is his mirror in whom he is beholding himself, but he
is not aware <A NAME="815"></A>of this. When he is with the lover, both
cease from their pain, but when he is away then he <A NAME="816"></A>longs
as he is longed for, and has love's image, love for love (Anteros) lodging
in his breast, <A NAME="817"></A>which he calls and believes to be not
love but friendship only, and his desire is as the desire <A NAME="818"></A>of
the other, but weaker; he wants to see him, touch him, kiss him, embrace
him, and probably <A NAME="819"></A>not long afterwards his desire is accomplished.
When they meet, the wanton steed of the lover <A NAME="820"></A>has a word
to say to the charioteer; he would like to have a little pleasure in return
for <A NAME="821"></A>many pains, but the wanton steed of the beloved says
not a word, for he is bursting with passion <A NAME="822"></A>which he
understands not;-he throws his arms round the lover and embraces him as
his dearest <A NAME="823"></A>friend; and, when they are side by side,
he is not in it state in which he can refuse the lover <A NAME="824"></A>anything,
if he ask him; although his fellow-steed and the charioteer oppose him
with the arguments <A NAME="825"></A>of shame and reason. <A NAME="826"></A><BR>
<BR>
After this their happiness depends upon their self-control; if the better
elements <A NAME="827"></A>of the mind which lead to order and philosophy
prevail, then they pass their life here in happiness <A NAME="828"></A>and
harmony-masters of themselves and orderly-enslaving the vicious and emancipating
the virtuous <A NAME="829"></A>elements of the soul; and when the end comes,
they are light and winged for flight, having <A NAME="830"></A>conquered
in one of the three heavenly or truly Olympian victories; nor can human
discipline <A NAME="831"></A>or divine inspiration confer any greater blessing
on man than this. If, on the other hand, <A NAME="832"></A>they leave philosophy
and lead the lower life of ambition, then probably, after wine or in <A NAME="833"></A>some
other careless hour, the two wanton animals take the two souls when off
their guard and <A NAME="834"></A>bring them together, and they accomplish
that desire of their hearts which to the many is bliss; <A NAME="835"></A>and
this having once enjoyed they continue to enjoy, yet rarely because they
have not the approval <A NAME="836"></A>of the whole soul. They too are
dear, but not so dear to one another as the others, either <A NAME="837"></A>at
the time of their love or afterwards. They consider that they have given
and taken from <A NAME="838"></A>each other the most sacred pledges, and
they may not break them and fall into enmity. At last <A NAME="839"></A>they
pass out of the body, unwinged, but eager to soar, and thus obtain no mean
reward of love <A NAME="840"></A>and madness. For those who have once begun
the heavenward pilgrimage may not go down again <A NAME="841"></A>to darkness
and the journey beneath the earth, but they live in light always; happy
companions <A NAME="842"></A>in their pilgrimage, and when the time comes
at which they receive their wings they have the <A NAME="843"></A>same
plumage because of their love. <A NAME="844"></A><BR>
<BR>
Thus great are the heavenly blessings which the friendship of a lover will
confer upon <A NAME="845"></A>you, my youth. Whereas the attachment of
the non-lover, which is alloyed with a worldly prudence <A NAME="846"></A>and
has worldly and niggardly ways of doling out benefits, will breed in your
soul those vulgar <A NAME="847"></A>qualities which the populace applaud,
will send you bowling round the earth during a period <A NAME="848"></A>of
nine thousand years, and leave, you a fool in the world below. <A NAME="849"></A><BR>
<BR>
And thus, dear Eros, I have made and paid my recantation, as well and as
fairly as <A NAME="850"></A>I could; more especially in the matter of the
poetical figures which I was compelled to use, <A NAME="851"></A>because
Phaedrus would have them. And now forgive the past and accept the present,
and be gracious <A NAME="852"></A>and merciful to me, and do not in thine
anger deprive me of sight, or take from me the art <A NAME="853"></A>of
love which thou hast given me, but grant that I may be yet more esteemed
in the eyes of <A NAME="854"></A>the fair. And if Phaedrus or I myself
said anything rude in our first speeches, blame Lysias, <A NAME="855"></A>who
is the father of the brat, and let us have no more of his progeny; bid
him study philosophy, <A NAME="856"></A>like his brother Polemarchus; and
then his lover Phaedrus will no longer halt between two opinions, <A NAME="857"></A>but
will dedicate himself wholly to love and to philosophical discourses. <A NAME="858"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I join in the prayer, Socrates, and say with you, if this
be for my <A NAME="859"></A>good, may your words come to pass. But why
did you make your second oration so much finer than <A NAME="860"></A>the
first? I wonder why. And I begin to be afraid that I shall lose conceit
of Lysias, and <A NAME="861"></A>that he will appear tame in comparison,
even if he be willing to put another as fine and as <A NAME="862"></A>long
as yours into the field, which I doubt. For quite lately one of your politicians
was abusing <A NAME="863"></A>him on this very account; and called him
a &quot;speech writer&quot; again and again. So that a feeling <A NAME="864"></A>of
pride may probably induce him to give up writing speeches. <A NAME="865"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> What a very amusing notion! But I think, my young man, that
you are much <A NAME="866"></A>mistaken in your friend if you imagine that
he is frightened at a little noise; and possibly, <A NAME="867"></A>you
think that his assailant was in earnest? <A NAME="868"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I thought, Socrates, that he was. And you are aware that
the greatest <A NAME="869"></A>and most influential statesmen are ashamed
of writing speeches and leaving them in a written <A NAME="870"></A>form,
lest they should be called Sophists by posterity. <A NAME="871"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> You seem to be unconscious, Phaedrus, that the &quot;sweet
elbow&quot; of the proverb <A NAME="872"></A>is really the long arm of
the Nile. And you appear to be equally unaware of the fact that this <A NAME="873"></A>sweet
elbow of theirs is also a long arm. For there is nothing of which our great
politicians <A NAME="874"></A>are so fond as of writing speeches and bequeathing
them to posterity. And they add their admirers' <A NAME="875"></A>names
at the top of the writing, out of gratitude to them. <A NAME="876"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What do you mean? I do not understand. <A NAME="877"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Why, do you not know that when a politician writes, he begins
with the <A NAME="878"></A>names of his approvers? <A NAME="879"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> How so? <A NAME="880"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Why, he begins in this manner: &quot;Be it enacted by the senate,
the people, <A NAME="881"></A>or both, on the motion of a certain person,&quot;
who is our author; and so putting on a serious <A NAME="882"></A>face,
he proceeds to display his own wisdom to his admirers in what is often
a long and tedious <A NAME="883"></A>composition. Now what is that sort
of thing but a regular piece of authorship? <A NAME="884"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> True. <A NAME="885"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And if the law is finally approved, then the author leaves
the theatre <A NAME="886"></A>in high delight; but if the law is rejected
and he is done out of his speech-making, and not <A NAME="887"></A>thought
good enough to write, then he and his party are in mourning. <A NAME="888"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Very true. <A NAME="889"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> So far are they from despising, or rather so highly do they
value the practice <A NAME="890"></A>of writing. <A NAME="891"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> No doubt. <A NAME="892"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And when the king or orator has the power, as Lycurgus or Solon
or Darius <A NAME="893"></A>had, of attaining an immortality or authorship
in a state, is he not thought by posterity, <A NAME="894"></A>when they
see his compositions, and does he not think himself, while he is yet alive,
to be <A NAME="895"></A>a god? <A NAME="896"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Very true. <A NAME="897"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then do you think that any one of this class, however ill-disposed,
would <A NAME="898"></A>reproach Lysias with being an author? <A NAME="899"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Not upon your view; for according to you he would be casting
a slur <A NAME="900"></A>upon his own favourite pursuit. <A NAME="901"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Any one may see that there is no disgrace in the mere fact
of writing. <A NAME="902"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly not. <A NAME="903"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The disgrace begins when a man writes not well, but badly.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Clearly. <A NAME="905"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And what is well and what is badly-need we ask Lysias, or any
other poet <A NAME="906"></A>or orator, who ever wrote or will write either
a political or any other work, in metre or out <A NAME="907"></A>of metre,
poet or prose writer, to teach us this? <A NAME="908"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Need we? For what should a man live if not for the pleasures
of discourse? <A NAME="909"></A>Surely not for the sake of bodily pleasures,
which almost always have previous pain as a condition <A NAME="910"></A>of
them, and therefore are rightly called slavish. <A NAME="911"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> There is time enough. And I believe that the grasshoppers chirruping
after <A NAME="912"></A>their manner in the heat of the sun over our heads
are talking to one another and looking down <A NAME="913"></A>at us. What
would they say if they saw that we, like the many, are not conversing,
but slumbering <A NAME="914"></A>at mid-day, lulled by their voices, too
indolent to think? Would they not have a right to laugh <A NAME="915"></A>at
us? They might imagine that we were slaves, who, coming to rest at a place
of resort of <A NAME="916"></A>theirs, like sheep lie asleep at noon around
the well. But if they see us discoursing, and <A NAME="917"></A>like Odysseus
sailing past them, deaf to their siren voices, they may perhaps, out of
respect, <A NAME="918"></A>give us of the gifts which they receive from
the gods that they may impart them to men. <A NAME="919"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What gifts do you mean? I never heard of any. <A NAME="920"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> A lover of music like yourself ought surely to have heard the
story of <A NAME="921"></A>the grasshoppers, who are said to have been
human beings in an age before the Muses. And when <A NAME="922"></A>the
Muses came and song appeared they were ravished with delight; and singing
always, never <A NAME="923"></A>thought of eating and drinking, until at
last in their forgetfulness they died. And now they <A NAME="924"></A>live
again in the grasshoppers; and this is the return which the Muses make
to them-they neither <A NAME="925"></A>hunger, nor thirst, but from the
hour of their birth are always singing, and never eating or <A NAME="926"></A>drinking;
and when they die they go and inform the Muses in heaven who honours them
on earth. <A NAME="927"></A>They win the love of Terpsichore for the dancers
by their report of them; of Erato for the <A NAME="928"></A>lovers, and
of the other Muses for those who do them honour, according to the several
ways <A NAME="929"></A>of honouring them of Calliope the eldest Muse and
of Urania who is next to her, for the philosophers, <A NAME="930"></A>of
whose music the grasshoppers make report to them; for these are the Muses
who are chiefly <A NAME="931"></A>concerned with heaven and thought, divine
as well as human, and they have the sweetest utterance. <A NAME="932"></A>For
many reasons, then, we ought always to talk and not to sleep at mid-day.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Let us talk. <A NAME="934"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Shall we discuss the rules of writing and speech as we were
proposing? <A NAME="935"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Very good. <A NAME="936"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> In good speaking should not the mind of the speaker know the
truth of the <A NAME="937"></A>matter about which he is going to speak?
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> And yet, Socrates, I have heard that he who would be an
orator has nothing <A NAME="939"></A>to do with true justice, but only
with that which is likely to be approved by the many who <A NAME="940"></A>sit
in judgment; nor with the truly good or honourable, but only with opinion
about them, and <A NAME="941"></A>that from opinion comes persuasion, and
not from the truth. <A NAME="942"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The words of the wise are not to be set aside; for there is
probably something <A NAME="943"></A>in them; and therefore the meaning
of this saying is not hastily to be dismissed. <A NAME="944"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Very true. <A NAME="945"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Let us put the matter thus:-Suppose that I persuaded you to
buy a horse <A NAME="946"></A>and go to the wars. Neither of us knew what
a horse was like, but I knew that you believed <A NAME="947"></A>a horse
to be of tame animals the one which has the longest ears. <A NAME="948"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That would be ridiculous. <A NAME="949"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> There is something more ridiculous coming:-Suppose, further,
that in sober <A NAME="950"></A>earnest I, having persuaded you of this,
went and composed a speech in honour of an ass, whom <A NAME="951"></A>I
entitled a horse beginning: &quot;A noble animal and a most useful possession,
especially in war, <A NAME="952"></A>and you may get on his back and fight,
and he will carry baggage or anything.&quot; <A NAME="953"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> How ridiculous! <A NAME="954"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Ridiculous! Yes; but is not even a ridiculous friend better
than a cunning <A NAME="955"></A>enemy? <A NAME="956"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="957"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And when the orator instead of putting an ass in the place
of a horse puts <A NAME="958"></A>good for evil being himself as ignorant
of their true nature as the city on which he imposes <A NAME="959"></A>is
ignorant; and having studied the notions of the multitude, falsely persuades
them not about <A NAME="960"></A>&quot;the shadow of an ass,&quot; which
he confounds with a horse, but about good which he confounds <A NAME="961"></A>with
evily-what will be the harvest which rhetoric will be likely to gather
after the sowing <A NAME="962"></A>of that seed? <A NAME="963"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> The reverse of good. <A NAME="964"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> But perhaps rhetoric has been getting too roughly handled by
us, and she <A NAME="965"></A>might answer: What amazing nonsense you are
talking! As if I forced any man to learn to speak <A NAME="966"></A>in
ignorance of the truth! Whatever my advice may be worth, I should have
told him to arrive <A NAME="967"></A>at the truth first, and then come
to me. At the same time I boldly assert that mere knowledge <A NAME="968"></A>of
the truth will not give you the art of persuasion. <A NAME="969"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> There is reason in the lady's defence of herself. <A NAME="970"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Quite true; if only the other arguments which remain to be
brought up bear <A NAME="971"></A>her witness that she is an art at all.
But I seem to hear them arraying themselves on the opposite <A NAME="972"></A>side,
declaring that she speaks falsely, and that rhetoric is a mere routine
and trick, not <A NAME="973"></A>an art. Lo! a Spartan appears, and says
that there never is nor ever will be a real art of <A NAME="974"></A>speaking
which is divorced from the truth. <A NAME="975"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> And what are these arguments, Socrates? Bring them out that
we may examine <A NAME="976"></A>them. <A NAME="977"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Come out, fair children, and convince Phaedrus, who is the
father of similar <A NAME="978"></A>beauties, that he will never be able
to speak about anything as he ought to speak unless he <A NAME="979"></A>have
a knowledge of philosophy. And let Phaedrus answer you. <A NAME="980"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Put the question. <A NAME="981"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Is not rhetoric, taken generally, a universal art of enchanting
the mind <A NAME="982"></A>by arguments; which is practised not only in
courts and public assemblies, but in private houses <A NAME="983"></A>also,
having to do with all matters, great as well as small, good and bad alike,
and is in <A NAME="984"></A>all equally right, and equally to be esteemed-that
is what you have heard? <A NAME="985"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Nay, not exactly that; I should say rather that I have heard
the art <A NAME="986"></A>confined to speaking and writing in lawsuits,
and to speaking in public assemblies-not extended <A NAME="987"></A>farther.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then I suppose that you have only heard of the rhetoric of
Nestor and Odysseus, <A NAME="989"></A>which they composed in their leisure
hours when at Troy, and never of the rhetoric of Palamedes? <A NAME="990"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> No more than of Nestor and Odysseus, unless Gorgias is your
Nestor, <A NAME="991"></A>and Thrasymachus or Theodorus your Odysseus.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Perhaps that is my meaning. But let us leave them. And do you
tell me, <A NAME="993"></A>instead, what are plaintiff and defendant doing
in a law court-are they not contending? <A NAME="994"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Exactly so. <A NAME="995"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> About the just and unjust-that is the matter in dispute? <A NAME="996"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes. <A NAME="997"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And a professor of the art will make the same thing appear
to the same <A NAME="998"></A>persons to be at one time just, at another
time, if he is so inclined, to be unjust? <A NAME="999"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Exactly. <A NAME="1000"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And when he speaks in the assembly, he will make the same things
seem good <A NAME="1001"></A>to the city at one time, and at another time
the reverse of good? <A NAME="1002"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That is true. <A NAME="1003"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Have we not heard of the Eleatic Palamedes (Zeno), who has
an art of speaking <A NAME="1004"></A>by which he makes the same things
appear to his hearers like and unlike, one and many, at rest <A NAME="1005"></A>and
in motion? <A NAME="1006"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Very true. <A NAME="1007"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The art of disputation, then, is not confined to the courts
and the assembly, <A NAME="1008"></A>but is one and the same in every use
of language; this is the art, if there be such an art, <A NAME="1009"></A>which
is able to find a likeness of everything to which a likeness can be found,
and draws <A NAME="1010"></A>into the light of day the likenesses and disguises
which are used by others? <A NAME="1011"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> How do you mean? <A NAME="1012"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Let me put the matter thus: When will there be more chance
of deception-when <A NAME="1013"></A>the difference is large or small?
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> When the difference is small. <A NAME="1015"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And you will be less likely to be discovered in passing by
degrees into <A NAME="1016"></A>the other extreme than when you go all
at once? <A NAME="1017"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Of course. <A NAME="1018"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> He, then, who would. deceive others, and not be deceived, must
exactly <A NAME="1019"></A>know the real likenesses and differences of
things? <A NAME="1020"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> He must. <A NAME="1021"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And if he is ignorant of the true nature of any subject, how
can he detect <A NAME="1022"></A>the greater or less degree of likeness
in other things to that of which by the hypothesis he <A NAME="1023"></A>is
ignorant? <A NAME="1024"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> He cannot. <A NAME="1025"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And when men are deceived and their notions are at variance
with realities, <A NAME="1026"></A>it is clear that the error slips in
through resemblances? <A NAME="1027"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, that is the way. <A NAME="1028"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then he who would be a master of the art must understand the
real nature <A NAME="1029"></A>of everything; or he will never know either
how to make the gradual departure from truth into <A NAME="1030"></A>the
opposite of truth which is effected by the help of resemblances, or how
to avoid it? <A NAME="1031"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> He will not. <A NAME="1032"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> He then, who being ignorant of the truth aims at appearances,
will only <A NAME="1033"></A>attain an art of rhetoric which is ridiculous
and is not an art at all? <A NAME="1034"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That may be expected. <A NAME="1035"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Shall I propose that we look for examples of art and want of
art, according <A NAME="1036"></A>to our notion of them, in the speech
of Lysias which you have in your hand, and in my own speech? <A NAME="1037"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Nothing could be better; and indeed I think that our previous
argument <A NAME="1038"></A>has been too abstract and-wanting in illustrations.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes; and the two speeches happen to afford a very good example
of the way <A NAME="1040"></A>in which the speaker who knows the truth
may, without any serious purpose, steal away the hearts <A NAME="1041"></A>of
his hearers. This piece of good-fortune I attribute to the local deities;
and perhaps, the <A NAME="1042"></A>prophets of the Muses who are singing
over our heads may have imparted their inspiration to <A NAME="1043"></A>me.
For I do not imagine that I have any rhetorical art of my own. <A NAME="1044"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Granted; if you will only please to get on. <A NAME="1045"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Suppose that you read me the first words of Lysias' speech.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>
Phaedr. &quot;You know how matters stand with me, and how, as I conceive,
they might be arranged <A NAME="1047"></A>for our common interest; and
I maintain that I ought not to fail in my suit, because I am not <A NAME="1048"></A>your
lover. For lovers repent-&quot; <A NAME="1049"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Enough:-Now, shall I point out the rhetorical error of those
words? <A NAME="1050"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes. <A NAME="1051"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Every one is aware that about some things we are agreed, whereas
about <A NAME="1052"></A>other things we differ. <A NAME="1053"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I think that I understand you; but will you explain yourself?
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> When any one speaks of iron and silver, is not the same thing
present in <A NAME="1055"></A>the minds of all? <A NAME="1056"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="1057"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> But when any one speaks of justice and goodness we part company
and are <A NAME="1058"></A>at odds with one another and with ourselves?
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Precisely. <A NAME="1060"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then in some things we agree, but not in others? <A NAME="1061"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That is true. <A NAME="1062"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> In which are we more likely to be deceived, and in which has
rhetoric the <A NAME="1063"></A>greater power? <A NAME="1064"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Clearly, in the uncertain class. <A NAME="1065"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then the rhetorician ought to make a regular division, and
acquire a distinct <A NAME="1066"></A>notion of both classes, as well of
that in which the many err, as of that in which they do <A NAME="1067"></A>not
err? <A NAME="1068"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> He who made such a distinction would have an excellent principle.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes; and in the next place he must have a keen eye for the
observation <A NAME="1070"></A>of particulars in speaking, and not make
a mistake about the class to which they are to be <A NAME="1071"></A>referred.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="1073"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Now to which class does love belong-to the debatable or to
the undisputed <A NAME="1074"></A>class? <A NAME="1075"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> To the debatable, clearly; for if not, do you think that
love would <A NAME="1076"></A>have allowed you to say as you did, that
he is an evil both to the lover and the beloved, and <A NAME="1077"></A>also
the greatest possible good? <A NAME="1078"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Capital. But will you tell me whether I defined love at the
beginning of <A NAME="1079"></A>my speech? for, having been in an ecstasy,
I cannot well remember. <A NAME="1080"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, indeed; that you did, and no mistake. <A NAME="1081"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then I perceive that the Nymphs of Achelous and Pan the son
of Hermes, <A NAME="1082"></A>who inspired me, were far better rhetoricians
than Lysias the son of Cephalus. Alas! how inferior <A NAME="1083"></A>to
them he is! But perhaps I am mistaken; and Lysias at the commencement of
his lover's speech <A NAME="1084"></A>did insist on our supposing love
to be something or other which he fancied him to be, and according <A NAME="1085"></A>to
this model he fashioned and framed the remainder of his discourse. Suppose
we read his beginning <A NAME="1086"></A>over again: <A NAME="1087"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> If you please; but you will not find what you want. <A NAME="1088"></A><BR>
Soc, Read, that I may have his exact words. <A NAME="1089"></A><BR>
Phaedr. &quot;You know how matters stand with and how, as I conceive, they
might be arranged <A NAME="1090"></A>for our common interest; and I maintain
I ought not to fail in my suit because I am not your <A NAME="1091"></A>lover,
for lovers repent of the kindnesses which they have shown, when their love
is over.&quot; <A NAME="1092"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Here he appears to have done just the reverse of what he ought;
for he <A NAME="1093"></A>has begun at the end, and is swimming on his
back through the flood to the place of starting. <A NAME="1094"></A>His
address to the fair youth begins where the lover would have ended. Am I
not right, sweet <A NAME="1095"></A>Phaedrus? <A NAME="1096"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, indeed, Socrates; he does begin at the end. <A NAME="1097"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then as to the other topics-are they not thrown down anyhow?
Is there any <A NAME="1098"></A>principle in them? Why should the next
topic follow next in order, or any other topic? I cannot <A NAME="1099"></A>help
fancying in my ignorance that he wrote off boldly just what came into his
head, but I <A NAME="1100"></A>dare say that you would recognize a rhetorical
necessity in the succession of the several parts <A NAME="1101"></A>of
the composition? <A NAME="1102"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> You have too good an opinion of me if you think that I have
any such <A NAME="1103"></A>insight into his principles of composition.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> At any rate, you will allow that every discourse ought to be
a living creature, <A NAME="1105"></A>having a body of its own and a head
and feet; there should be a middle, beginning, and end, <A NAME="1106"></A>adapted
to one another and to the whole? <A NAME="1107"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="1108"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Can this be said of the discourse of Lysias? See whether you
can find any <A NAME="1109"></A>more connexion in his words than in the
epitaph which is said by some to have been inscribed <A NAME="1110"></A>on
the grave of Midas the Phrygian. <A NAME="1111"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What is there remarkable in the epitaph? <A NAME="1112"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> It is as follows:- <A NAME="1113"></A><BR>
<BR>
I am a maiden of bronze and lie on the tomb of Midas; <A NAME="1114"></A><BR>
So long as water flows and tall trees grow, <A NAME="1115"></A><BR>
So long here on this spot by his sad tomb abiding, <A NAME="1116"></A><BR>
I shall declare to passers-by that Midas sleeps below. Now in this rhyme
whether a line <A NAME="1117"></A>comes first or comes last, as you will
perceive, makes no difference. <A NAME="1118"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> You are making fun of that oration of ours. <A NAME="1119"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Well, I will say no more about your friend's speech lest I
should give <A NAME="1120"></A>offence to you; although I think that it
might furnish many other examples of what a man ought <A NAME="1121"></A>rather
to avoid. But I will proceed to the other speech, which, as I think, is
also suggestive <A NAME="1122"></A>to students of rhetoric. <A NAME="1123"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> In what way? <A NAME="1124"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The two speeches, as you may remember, were unlike-I the one
argued that <A NAME="1125"></A>the lover and the other that the non-lover
ought to be accepted. <A NAME="1126"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> And right manfully. <A NAME="1127"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> You should rather say &quot;madly&quot;; and madness was the
argument of them, for, <A NAME="1128"></A>as I said, &quot;love is a madness.&quot;
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes. <A NAME="1130"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And of madness there were two kinds; one produced by human
infirmity, the <A NAME="1131"></A>other was a divine release of the soul
from the yoke of custom and convention. <A NAME="1132"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> True. <A NAME="1133"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The divine madness was subdivided into four kinds, prophetic,
initiatory, <A NAME="1134"></A>poetic, erotic, having four gods presiding
over them; the first was the inspiration of Apollo, <A NAME="1135"></A>the
second that of Dionysus, the third that of the Muses, the fourth that of
Aphrodite and <A NAME="1136"></A>Eros. In the description of the last kind
of madness, which was also said to be the best, we <A NAME="1137"></A>spoke
of the affection of love in a figure, into which we introduced a tolerably
credible and <A NAME="1138"></A>possibly true though partly erring myth,
which was also a hymn in honour of Love, who is your <A NAME="1139"></A>lord
and also mine, Phaedrus, and the guardian of fair children, and to him
we sung the hymn <A NAME="1140"></A>in measured and solemn strain. <A NAME="1141"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I know that I had great pleasure in listening to you. <A NAME="1142"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Let us take this instance and note how the transition was made
from blame <A NAME="1143"></A>to praise. <A NAME="1144"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What do you mean? <A NAME="1145"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I mean to say that the composition was mostly playful. Yet
in these chance <A NAME="1146"></A>fancies of the hour were involved two
principles of which we should be too glad to have a clearer <A NAME="1147"></A>description
if art could give us one. <A NAME="1148"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What are they? <A NAME="1149"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> First, the comprehension of scattered particulars in one idea;
as in our <A NAME="1150"></A>definition of love, which whether true or
false certainly gave clearness and consistency to <A NAME="1151"></A>the
discourse, the speaker should define his several notions and so make his
meaning clear. <A NAME="1152"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What is the other principle, Socrates? <A NAME="1153"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The second principle is that of division into species according
to the <A NAME="1154"></A>natural formation, where the joint is, not breaking
any part as a bad carver might. Just as <A NAME="1155"></A>our two discourses,
alike assumed, first of all, a single form of unreason; and then, as the
<A NAME="1156"></A>body which from being one becomes double and may be
divided into a left side and right side, <A NAME="1157"></A>each having
parts right and left of the same name-after this manner the speaker proceeded
to <A NAME="1158"></A>divide the parts of the left side and did not desist
until he found in them an evil or left-handed <A NAME="1159"></A>love which
he justly reviled; and the other discourse leading us to the madness which
lay on <A NAME="1160"></A>the right side, found another love, also having
the same name, but divine, which the speaker <A NAME="1161"></A>held up
before us and applauded and affirmed to be the author of the greatest benefits.
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Most true. <A NAME="1163"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I am myself a great lover of these processes of division and
generalization; <A NAME="1164"></A>they help me to speak and to think.
And if I find any man who is able to see &quot;a One and Many&quot; <A NAME="1165"></A>in
nature, him I follow, and &quot;walk in his footsteps as if he were a god.&quot;
And those who have <A NAME="1166"></A>this art, I have hitherto been in
the habit of calling dialecticians; but God knows whether <A NAME="1167"></A>the
name is right or not. And I should like to know what name you would give
to your or to <A NAME="1168"></A>Lysias' disciples, and whether this may
not be that famous art of rhetoric which Thrasymachus <A NAME="1169"></A>and
others teach and practise? Skilful speakers they are, and impart their
skill to any who <A NAME="1170"></A>is willing to make kings of them and
to bring gifts to them. <A NAME="1171"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, they are royal men; but their art is not the same with
the art <A NAME="1172"></A>of those whom you call, and rightly, in my opinion,
dialecticians:-Still we are in the dark <A NAME="1173"></A>about rhetoric.
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> What do you mean? The remains of it, if there be anything remaining
which <A NAME="1175"></A>can be brought under rules of art, must be a fine
thing; and, at any rate, is not to be despised <A NAME="1176"></A>by you
and me. But how much is left? <A NAME="1177"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> There is a great deal surely to be found in books of rhetoric?
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes; thank you for reminding me:-There is the exordium, showing
how the <A NAME="1179"></A>speech should begin, if I remember rightly;
that is what you mean-the niceties of the art? <A NAME="1180"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes. <A NAME="1181"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then follows the statement of facts, and upon that witnesses;
thirdly, <A NAME="1182"></A>proofs; fourthly, probabilities are to come;
the great Byzantian word-maker also speaks, if <A NAME="1183"></A>I am
not mistaken, of confirmation and further confirmation. <A NAME="1184"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> You mean the excellent Theodorus. <A NAME="1185"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes; and he tells how refutation or further refutation is to
be managed, <A NAME="1186"></A>whether in accusation or defence. I ought
also to mention the illustrious Parian, Evenus, who <A NAME="1187"></A>first
invented insinuations and indirect praises; and also indirect censures,
which according <A NAME="1188"></A>to some he put into verse to help the
memory. But shall I &quot;to dumb forgetfulness consign&quot; Tisias <A NAME="1189"></A>and
Gorgias, who are not ignorant that probability is superior to truth, and
who by: force <A NAME="1190"></A>of argument make the little appear great
and the great little, disguise the new in old fashions <A NAME="1191"></A>and
the old in new fashions, and have discovered forms for everything, either
short or going <A NAME="1192"></A>on to infinity. I remember Prodicus laughing
when I told him of this; he said that he had himself <A NAME="1193"></A>discovered
the true rule of art, which was to be neither long nor short, but of a
convenient <A NAME="1194"></A>length. <A NAME="1195"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Well done, Prodicus! <A NAME="1196"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then there is Hippias the Elean stranger, who probably agrees
with him. <A NAME="1197"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes. <A NAME="1198"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And there is also Polus, who has treasuries of diplasiology,
and gnomology, <A NAME="1199"></A>and eikonology, and who teaches in them
the names of which Licymnius made him a present; they <A NAME="1200"></A>were
to give a polish. <A NAME="1201"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Had not Protagoras something of the same sort? <A NAME="1202"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes, rules of correct diction and many other fine precepts;
for the &quot;sorrows <A NAME="1203"></A>of a poor old man,&quot; or any
other pathetic case, no one is better than the Chalcedonian giant; <A NAME="1204"></A>he
can put a whole company of people into a passion and out of one again by
his mighty magic, <A NAME="1205"></A>and is first-rate at inventing or
disposing of any sort of calumny on any grounds or none. <A NAME="1206"></A>All
of them agree in asserting that a speech should end in a recapitulation,
though they do <A NAME="1207"></A>not all agree to use the same word. <A NAME="1208"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> You mean that there should be a summing up of the arguments
in order <A NAME="1209"></A>to remind the hearers of them. <A NAME="1210"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I have now said all that I have to say of the art of rhetoric:
have you <A NAME="1211"></A>anything to add? <A NAME="1212"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Not much; nothing very important. <A NAME="1213"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Leave the unimportant and let us bring the really important
question into <A NAME="1214"></A>the light of day, which is: What power
has this art of rhetoric, and when? <A NAME="1215"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> A very great power in public meetings. <A NAME="1216"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> It has. But I should like to know whether you have the same
feeling as <A NAME="1217"></A>I have about the rhetoricians? To me there
seem to be a great many holes in their web. <A NAME="1218"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Give an example. <A NAME="1219"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I will. Suppose a person to come to your friend Eryximachus,
or to his <A NAME="1220"></A>father Acumenus, and to say to him: &quot;I
know how to apply drugs which shall have either a heating <A NAME="1221"></A>or
a cooling effect, and I can give a vomit and also a purge, and all that
sort of thing; and <A NAME="1222"></A>knowing all this, as I do, I claim
to be a physician and to make physicians by imparting this <A NAME="1223"></A>knowledge
to others,&quot;-what do you suppose that they would say? <A NAME="1224"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> They would be sure to ask him whether he knew &quot;to whom&quot;
he would give <A NAME="1225"></A>his medicines, and &quot;when,&quot; and
&quot;how much.&quot; <A NAME="1226"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And suppose that he were to reply: &quot;No; I know nothing
of all that; I expect <A NAME="1227"></A>the patient who consults me to
be able to do these things for himself&quot;? <A NAME="1228"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> They would say in reply that he is a madman or pedant who
fancies that <A NAME="1229"></A>he is a physician because he has read something
in a book, or has stumbled on a prescription <A NAME="1230"></A>or two,
although he has no real understanding of the art of medicine. <A NAME="1231"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And suppose a person were to come to Sophocles or Euripides
and say that <A NAME="1232"></A>he knows how to make a very long speech
about a small matter, and a short speech about a great <A NAME="1233"></A>matter,
and also a sorrowful speech, or a terrible, or threatening speech, or any
other kind <A NAME="1234"></A>of speech, and in teaching this fancies that
he is teaching the art of tragedy-? <A NAME="1235"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> They too would surely laugh at him if he fancies that tragedy
is anything <A NAME="1236"></A>but the arranging of these elements in a
manner which will be suitable to one another and to <A NAME="1237"></A>the
whole. <A NAME="1238"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> But I do not suppose that they would be rude or abusive to
him: Would they <A NAME="1239"></A>not treat him as a musician would a
man who thinks that he is a harmonist because he knows <A NAME="1240"></A>how
to pitch the highest and lowest notes; happening to meet such an one he
would not say to <A NAME="1241"></A>him savagely, &quot;Fool, you are mad!&quot;
But like a musician, in a gentle and harmonious tone of <A NAME="1242"></A>voice,
he would answer: &quot;My good friend, he who would be a harmonist must
certainly know this, <A NAME="1243"></A>and yet he may understand nothing
of harmony if he has not got beyond your stage of knowledge, <A NAME="1244"></A>for
you only know the preliminaries of harmony and not harmony itself.&quot;
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Very true. <A NAME="1246"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And will not Sophocles say to the display of the would-be tragedian,
that <A NAME="1247"></A>this is not tragedy but the preliminaries of tragedy?
and will not Acumenus say the same of <A NAME="1248"></A>medicine to the
would-be physician? <A NAME="1249"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Quite true. <A NAME="1250"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And if Adrastus the mellifluous or Pericles heard of these
wonderful arts, <A NAME="1251"></A>brachylogies and eikonologies and all
the hard names which we have been endeavouring to draw <A NAME="1252"></A>into
the light of day, what would they say? Instead of losing temper and applying
uncomplimentary <A NAME="1253"></A>epithets, as you and I have been doing,
to the authors of such an imaginary art, their superior <A NAME="1254"></A>wisdom
would rather censure us, as well as them. &quot;Have a little patience,
Phaedrus and Socrates, <A NAME="1255"></A>they would say; you should not
be in such a passion with those who from some want of dialectical <A NAME="1256"></A>skill
are unable to define the nature of rhetoric, and consequently suppose that
they have <A NAME="1257"></A>found the art in the preliminary conditions
of it, and when these have been taught by them <A NAME="1258"></A>to others,
fancy that the whole art of rhetoric has been taught by them; but as to
using the <A NAME="1259"></A>several instruments of the art effectively,
or making the composition a whole,-an application <A NAME="1260"></A>of
it such as this is they regard as an easy thing which their disciples may
make for themselves.&quot; <A NAME="1261"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I quite admit, Socrates, that the art of rhetoric which
these men teach <A NAME="1262"></A>and of which they write is such as you
describe-there I agree with you. But I still want to <A NAME="1263"></A>know
where and how the true art of rhetoric and persuasion is to be acquired.
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The perfection which is required of the finished orator is,
or rather must <A NAME="1265"></A>be, like the perfection of anything else;
partly given by nature, but may also be assisted <A NAME="1266"></A>by
art. If you have the natural power and add to it knowledge and practice,
you will be a distinguished <A NAME="1267"></A>speaker; if you fall short
in either of these, you will be to that extent defective. But the <A NAME="1268"></A>art,
as far as there is an art, of rhetoric does not lie in the direction of
Lysias or Thrasymachus. <A NAME="1269"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> In what direction then? <A NAME="1270"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I conceive Pericles to have been the most accomplished of rhetoricians.
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What of that? <A NAME="1272"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> All the great arts require discussion and high speculation
about the truths <A NAME="1273"></A>of nature; hence come loftiness of
thought and completeness of execution. And this, as I conceive, <A NAME="1274"></A>was
the quality which, in addition to his natural gifts, Pericles acquired
from his intercourse <A NAME="1275"></A>with Anaxagoras whom he happened
to know. He was thus imbued with the higher philosophy, and <A NAME="1276"></A>attained
the knowledge of Mind and the negative of Mind, which were favourite themes
of Anaxagoras, <A NAME="1277"></A>and applied what suited his purpose to
the art of speaking. <A NAME="1278"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Explain. <A NAME="1279"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Rhetoric is like medicine. <A NAME="1280"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> How so? <A NAME="1281"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Why, because medicine has to define the nature of the body
and rhetoric <A NAME="1282"></A>of the soul-if we would proceed, not empirically
but scientifically, in the one case to impart <A NAME="1283"></A>health
and strength by giving medicine and food in the other to implant the conviction
or virtue <A NAME="1284"></A>which you desire, by the right application
of words and training. <A NAME="1285"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> There, Socrates, I suspect that you are right. <A NAME="1286"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And do you think that you can know the nature of the soul intelligently
<A NAME="1287"></A>without knowing the nature of the whole? <A NAME="1288"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Hippocrates the Asclepiad says that the nature even of the
body can <A NAME="1289"></A>only be understood as a whole. <A NAME="1290"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes, friend, and he was right:-still, we ought not to be content
with the <A NAME="1291"></A>name of Hippocrates, but to examine and see
whether his argument agrees with his conception <A NAME="1292"></A>of nature.
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I agree. <A NAME="1294"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then consider what truth as well as Hippocrates says about
this or about <A NAME="1295"></A>any other nature. Ought we not to consider
first whether that which we wish to learn and to <A NAME="1296"></A>teach
is a simple or multiform thing, and if simple, then to enquire what power
it has of acting <A NAME="1297"></A>or being acted upon in relation to
other things, and if multiform, then to number the forms; <A NAME="1298"></A>and
see first in the case of one of them, and then in. case of all of them,
what is that power <A NAME="1299"></A>of acting or being acted upon which
makes each and all of them to be what they are? <A NAME="1300"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> You may very likely be right, Socrates. <A NAME="1301"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> The method which proceeds without analysis is like the groping
of a blind <A NAME="1302"></A>man. Yet, surely, he who is an artist ought
not to admit of a comparison with the blind, or <A NAME="1303"></A>deaf.
The rhetorician, who teaches his pupil to speak scientifically, will particularly
set <A NAME="1304"></A>forth the nature of that being to which he addresses
his speeches; and this, I conceive, to <A NAME="1305"></A>be the soul.
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="1307"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> His whole effort is directed to the soul; for in that he seeks
to produce <A NAME="1308"></A>conviction. <A NAME="1309"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes. <A NAME="1310"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then clearly, Thrasymachus or any one else who teaches rhetoric
in earnest <A NAME="1311"></A>will give an exact description of the nature
of the soul; which will enable us to see whether <A NAME="1312"></A>she
be single and same, or, like the body, multiform. That is what we should
call showing the <A NAME="1313"></A>nature of the soul. <A NAME="1314"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Exactly. <A NAME="1315"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> He will explain, secondly, the mode in which she acts or is
acted upon. <A NAME="1316"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> True. <A NAME="1317"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Thirdly, having classified men and speeches, and their kinds
and affections, <A NAME="1318"></A>and adapted them to one another, he
will tell the reasons of his arrangement, and show why <A NAME="1319"></A>one
soul is persuaded by a particular form of argument, and another not. <A NAME="1320"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> You have hit upon a very good way. <A NAME="1321"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes, that is the true and only way in which any subject can
be set forth <A NAME="1322"></A>or treated by rules of art, whether in
speaking or writing. But the writers of the present <A NAME="1323"></A>day,
at whose feet you have sat, craftily, conceal the nature of the soul which
they know quite <A NAME="1324"></A>well. Nor, until they adopt our method
of reading and writing, can we admit that they write <A NAME="1325"></A>by
rules of art? <A NAME="1326"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What is our method? <A NAME="1327"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I cannot give you the exact details; but I should like to tell
you generally, <A NAME="1328"></A>as far as is in my power, how a man ought
to proceed according to rules of art. <A NAME="1329"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Let me hear. <A NAME="1330"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Oratory is the art of enchanting the soul, and therefore he
who would be <A NAME="1331"></A>an orator has to learn the differences
of human souls-they are so many and of such a nature, <A NAME="1332"></A>and
from them come the differences between man and man. Having proceeded thus
far in his analysis, <A NAME="1333"></A>he will next divide speeches into
their different classes:-&quot;Such and such persons,&quot; he will <A NAME="1334"></A>say,
are affected by this or that kind of speech in this or that way,&quot;
and he will tell you <A NAME="1335"></A>why. The pupil must have a good
theoretical notion of them first, and then he must have experience <A NAME="1336"></A>of
them in actual life, and be able to follow them with all his senses about
him, or he will <A NAME="1337"></A>never get beyond the precepts of his
masters. But when he understands what persons are persuaded <A NAME="1338"></A>by
what arguments, and sees the person about whom he was speaking in the abstract
actually <A NAME="1339"></A>before him, and knows that it is he, and can
say to himself, &quot;This is the man or this is the <A NAME="1340"></A>character
who ought to have a certain argument applied to him in order to convince
him of a <A NAME="1341"></A>certain opinion&quot;; -he who knows all this,
and knows also when he should speak and when he should <A NAME="1342"></A>refrain,
and when he should use pithy sayings, pathetic appeals, sensational effects,
and all <A NAME="1343"></A>the other modes of speech which he has learned;-when,
I say, he knows the times and seasons <A NAME="1344"></A>of all these things,
then, and not till then, he is a perfect master of his art; but if he <A NAME="1345"></A>fail
in any of these points, whether in speaking or teaching or writing them,
and yet declares <A NAME="1346"></A>that he speaks by rules of art, he
who says &quot;I don't believe you&quot; has the better of him. Well, <A NAME="1347"></A>the
teacher will say, is this, and Socrates, your account of the so-called
art of rhetoric, <A NAME="1348"></A>or am I to look for another? <A NAME="1349"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> He must take this, Socrates for there is no possibility
of another, <A NAME="1350"></A>and yet the creation of such an art is not
easy. <A NAME="1351"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Very true; and therefore let us consider this matter in every
light, and <A NAME="1352"></A>see whether we cannot find a shorter and
easier road; there is no use in taking a long rough <A NAME="1353"></A>round-about
way if there be a shorter and easier one. And I wish that you would try
and remember <A NAME="1354"></A>whether you have heard from Lysias or any
one else anything which might be of service to us. <A NAME="1355"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> If trying would avail, then I might; but at the moment I
can think of <A NAME="1356"></A>nothing. <A NAME="1357"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Suppose I tell you something which somebody who knows told
me. <A NAME="1358"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="1359"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> May not &quot;the wolf,&quot; as the proverb says, claim a
hearing&quot;? <A NAME="1360"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Do you say what can be said for him. <A NAME="1361"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> He will argue that is no use in putting a solemn face on these
matters, <A NAME="1362"></A>or in going round and round, until you arrive
at first principles; for, as I said at first, <A NAME="1363"></A>when the
question is of justice and good, or is a question in which men are concerned
who are <A NAME="1364"></A>just and good, either by nature or habit, he
who would be a skilful rhetorician has; no need <A NAME="1365"></A>of truth-for
that in courts of law men literally care nothing about truth, but only
about conviction: <A NAME="1366"></A>and this is based on probability,
to which who would be a skilful orator should therefore give <A NAME="1367"></A>his
whole attention. And they say also that there are cases in which the actual
facts, if they <A NAME="1368"></A>are improbable, ought to be withheld,
and only the probabilities should be told either in accusation <A NAME="1369"></A>or
defence, and that always in speaking, the orator should keep probability
in view, and say <A NAME="1370"></A>good-bye to the truth. And the observance,
of this principle throughout a speech furnishes <A NAME="1371"></A>the
whole art. <A NAME="1372"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That is what the professors of rhetoric do actually say,
Socrates. I <A NAME="1373"></A>have not forgotten that we have quite briefly
touched upon this matter already; with them the <A NAME="1374"></A>point
is all-important. <A NAME="1375"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I dare say that you are familiar with Tisias. Does he not define
probability <A NAME="1376"></A>to be that which the many think? <A NAME="1377"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly, he does. <A NAME="1378"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I believe that he has a clever and ingenious case of this sort:-He
supposes <A NAME="1379"></A>a feeble and valiant man to have assaulted
a strong and cowardly one, and to have robbed him <A NAME="1380"></A>of
his coat or of something or other; he is brought into court, and then Tisias
says that both <A NAME="1381"></A>parties should tell lies: the coward
should say that he was assaulted by more men than one; <A NAME="1382"></A>the
other should prove that they were alone, and should argue thus: &quot;How
could a weak man like <A NAME="1383"></A>me have assaulted a strong man
like him?&quot; The complainant will not like to confess his own <A NAME="1384"></A>cowardice,
and will therefore invent some other lie which his adversary will thus
gain an opportunity <A NAME="1385"></A>of refuting. And there are other
devices of the same kind which have a place in the system. <A NAME="1386"></A>Am
I not right, Phaedrus? <A NAME="1387"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="1388"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Bless me, what a wonderfully mysterious art is this which Tisias
or some <A NAME="1389"></A>other gentleman, in whatever name or country
he rejoices, has discovered. Shall we say a word <A NAME="1390"></A>to
him or not? <A NAME="1391"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What shall we say to him? <A NAME="1392"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Let us tell him that, before he appeared, you and I were saying
that the <A NAME="1393"></A>probability of which he speaks was engendered
in the minds of the many by the likeness of the <A NAME="1394"></A>truth,
and we had just been affirming that he who knew the truth would always
know best how <A NAME="1395"></A>to discover the resemblances of the truth.
If he has anything else to say about the art of <A NAME="1396"></A>speaking
we should like to hear him; but if not, we are satisfied with our own view,
that unless <A NAME="1397"></A>a man estimates the various characters of
his heaters and is able to divide all things into <A NAME="1398"></A>classes
and to comprehend them under single ideas he will never be a skilful rhetorician
even <A NAME="1399"></A>within the limits of human power. And this skill
he will not attain without a great deal of <A NAME="1400"></A>trouble,
which a good man ought to undergo, not for the sake of speaking and acting
before <A NAME="1401"></A>men, but in order that he may be able to say
what is acceptable to God and always to act acceptably <A NAME="1402"></A>to
Him as far as in him lies; for there is a saying of wiser men than ourselves,
that a man <A NAME="1403"></A>of sense should not try to please his fellow-servants
(at least this should not be his first <A NAME="1404"></A>object) but his
good and noble masters; and therefore if the way is long and circuitous,
marvel <A NAME="1405"></A>not at this, for, where the end is great, there
we may take the longer road, but not for lesser <A NAME="1406"></A>ends
such as yours. Truly, the argument may say, Tisias, that if you do not
mind going so far, <A NAME="1407"></A>rhetoric has a fair beginning here.
<A NAME="1408"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I think, Socrates, that this is admirable, if only practicable.
<A NAME="1409"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> But even to fail in an honourable object is honourable. <A NAME="1410"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> True. <A NAME="1411"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Enough appears to have been said by us of a true and false
art of speaking. <A NAME="1412"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="1413"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> But there is something yet to be said of propriety and impropriety
of writing. <A NAME="1414"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes. <A NAME="1415"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Do you know how you can speak or act about rhetoric in a manner
which will <A NAME="1416"></A>be acceptable to God? <A NAME="1417"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> No, indeed. Do you? <A NAME="1418"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I have heard a tradition of the ancients, whether true or not
they only <A NAME="1419"></A>know; although if we had found the truth ourselves,
do you think that we should care much about <A NAME="1420"></A>the opinions
of men? <A NAME="1421"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Your question needs no answer; but I wish that you would
tell me what <A NAME="1422"></A>you say that you have heard. <A NAME="1423"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> At the Egyptian city of Naucratis, there was a famous old god,
whose name <A NAME="1424"></A>was Theuth; the bird which is called the
Ibis is sacred to him, and he was the inventor of <A NAME="1425"></A>many
arts, such as arithmetic and calculation and geometry and astronomy and
draughts and dice, <A NAME="1426"></A>but his great discovery was the use
of letters. Now in those days the god Thamus was the king <A NAME="1427"></A>of
the whole country of Egypt; and he dwelt in that great city of Upper Egypt
which the Hellenes <A NAME="1428"></A>call Egyptian Thebes, and the god
himself is called by them Ammon. To came Theuth and showed <A NAME="1429"></A>his
inventions, desiring that the other Egyptians might be allowed to have
the benefit of the <A NAME="1430"></A>he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired
about their several uses, and praised some of them <A NAME="1431"></A>and
censured others, as he approved or disapproved of them. It would take a
long time to repeat <A NAME="1432"></A>all that Thamus said to Theuth in
praise or blame of the various arts. But when they came to <A NAME="1433"></A>letters,
This, said Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories;
it <A NAME="1434"></A>is a specific both for the memory and for the wit.
Thamus replied: O most ingenious Theuth, <A NAME="1435"></A>the parent
or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility
of <A NAME="1436"></A>his own inventions to the users of them. And in this
instance, you who are the father of letters, <A NAME="1437"></A>from a
paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a
quality which <A NAME="1438"></A>they cannot have; for this discovery of
yours will create forgetfulness in the learners' souls, <A NAME="1439"></A>because
they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written
characters <A NAME="1440"></A>and not remember of themselves. The specific
which you have discovered is an aid not to memory, <A NAME="1441"></A>but
to reminiscence, and you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance
of truth; <A NAME="1442"></A>they will be hearers of many things and will
have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient <A NAME="1443"></A>and
will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the
show of wisdom without <A NAME="1444"></A>the reality. <A NAME="1445"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, Socrates, you can easily invent tales of Egypt, or
of any other <A NAME="1446"></A>country. <A NAME="1447"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> There was a tradition in the temple of Dodona that oaks first
gave prophetic <A NAME="1448"></A>utterances. The men of old, unlike in
their simplicity to young philosophy, deemed that if <A NAME="1449"></A>they
heard the truth even from &quot;oak or rock,&quot; it was enough for them;
whereas you seem to consider <A NAME="1450"></A>not whether a thing is
or is not true, but who the speaker is and from what country the tale <A NAME="1451"></A>comes.
<A NAME="1452"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I acknowledge the justice of your rebuke; and I think that
the Theban <A NAME="1453"></A>is right in his view about letters. <A NAME="1454"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> He would be a very simple person, and quite a stranger to the
oracles of <A NAME="1455"></A>Thamus or Ammon, who should leave in writing
or receive in writing any art under the idea that <A NAME="1456"></A>the
written word would be intelligible or certain; or who deemed that writing
was at all better <A NAME="1457"></A>than knowledge and recollection of
the same matters? <A NAME="1458"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That is most true. <A NAME="1459"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately
like painting; <A NAME="1460"></A>for the creations of the painter have
the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question <A NAME="1461"></A>they
preserve a solemn silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would
imagine that <A NAME="1462"></A>they had intelligence, but if you want
to know anything and put a question to one of them, <A NAME="1463"></A>the
speaker always gives one unvarying answer. And when they have been once
written down they <A NAME="1464"></A>are tumbled about anywhere among those
who may or may not understand them, and know not to <A NAME="1465"></A>whom
they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused,
they have no parent <A NAME="1466"></A>to protect them; and they cannot
protect or defend themselves. <A NAME="1467"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That again is most true. <A NAME="1468"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Is there not another kind of word or speech far better than
this, and having <A NAME="1469"></A>far greater power-a son of the same
family, but lawfully begotten? <A NAME="1470"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Whom do you mean, and what is his origin? <A NAME="1471"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I mean an intelligent word graven in the soul of the learner,
which can <A NAME="1472"></A>defend itself, and knows when to speak and
when to be silent. <A NAME="1473"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> You mean the living word of knowledge which has a soul,
and of which <A NAME="1474"></A>written word is properly no more than an
image? <A NAME="1475"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Yes, of course that is what I mean. And now may I be allowed
to ask you <A NAME="1476"></A>a question: Would a husbandman, who is a
man of sense, take the seeds, which he values and <A NAME="1477"></A>which
he wishes to bear fruit, and in sober seriousness plant them during the
heat of summer, <A NAME="1478"></A>in some garden of Adonis, that he may
rejoice when he sees them in eight days appearing in <A NAME="1479"></A>beauty?
at least he would do so, if at all, only for the sake of amusement and
pastime. But <A NAME="1480"></A>when he is in earnest he sows in fitting
soil, and practises husbandry, and is satisfied if <A NAME="1481"></A>in
eight months the seeds which he has sown arrive at perfection? <A NAME="1482"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, Socrates, that will be his way when he is in earnest;
he will do <A NAME="1483"></A>the other, as you say, only in play. <A NAME="1484"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And can we suppose that he who knows the just and good and
honourable has <A NAME="1485"></A>less understanding, than the husbandman,
about his own seeds? <A NAME="1486"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly not. <A NAME="1487"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Then he will not seriously incline to &quot;write&quot; his
thoughts &quot;in water&quot; with <A NAME="1488"></A>pen and ink, sowing
words which can neither speak for themselves nor teach the truth adequately
<A NAME="1489"></A>to others? <A NAME="1490"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> No, that is not likely. <A NAME="1491"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> No, that is not likely-in the garden of letters he will sow
and plant, <A NAME="1492"></A>but only for the sake of recreation and amusement;
he will write them down as memorials to <A NAME="1493"></A>be treasured
against the forgetfulness of old age, by himself, or by any other old man
who <A NAME="1494"></A>is treading the same path. He will rejoice in beholding
their tender growth; and while others <A NAME="1495"></A>are refreshing
their souls with banqueting and the like, this will be the pastime in which
<A NAME="1496"></A>his days are spent. <A NAME="1497"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> A pastime, Socrates, as noble as the other is ignoble, the
pastime of <A NAME="1498"></A>a man who can be amused by serious talk,
and can discourse merrily about justice and the like. <A NAME="1499"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> True, Phaedrus. But nobler far is the serious pursuit of the
dialectician, <A NAME="1500"></A>who, finding a congenial soul, by the
help of science sows and plants therein words which are <A NAME="1501"></A>able
to help themselves and him who planted them, and are not unfruitful, but
have in them <A NAME="1502"></A>a seed which others brought up in different
soils render immortal, making the possessors of <A NAME="1503"></A>it happy
to the utmost extent of human happiness. <A NAME="1504"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Far nobler, certainly. <A NAME="1505"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And now, Phaedrus, having agreed upon the premises we decide
about the <A NAME="1506"></A>conclusion. <A NAME="1507"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> About what conclusion? <A NAME="1508"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> About Lysias, whom we censured, and his art of writing, and
his discourses, <A NAME="1509"></A>and the rhetorical skill or want of
skill which was shown in them-these are the questions which <A NAME="1510"></A>we
sought to determine, and they brought us to this point. And I think that
we are now pretty <A NAME="1511"></A>well informed about the nature of
art and its opposite. <A NAME="1512"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, I think with you; but I wish that you would repeat
what was said. <A NAME="1513"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Until a man knows the truth of the several particulars of which
he is writing <A NAME="1514"></A>or speaking, and is able to define them
as they are, and having defined them again to divide <A NAME="1515"></A>them
until they can be no longer divided, and until in like manner he is able
to discern the <A NAME="1516"></A>nature of the soul, and discover the
different modes of discourse which are adapted to different <A NAME="1517"></A>natures,
and to arrange and dispose them in such a way that the simple form of speech
may be <A NAME="1518"></A>addressed to the simpler nature, and the complex
and composite to the more complex nature-until <A NAME="1519"></A>he has
accomplished all this, he will be unable to handle arguments according
to rules of art, <A NAME="1520"></A>as far as their nature allows them
to be subjected to art, either for the purpose of teaching <A NAME="1521"></A>or
persuading;-such is the view which is implied in the whole preceding argument.
<A NAME="1522"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, that was our view, certainly. <A NAME="1523"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Secondly, as to the censure which was passed on the speaking
or writing <A NAME="1524"></A>of discourses, and how they might be rightly
or wrongly censured-did not our previous argument <A NAME="1525"></A>show?-
<A NAME="1526"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Show what? <A NAME="1527"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> That whether Lysias or any other writer that ever was or will
be, whether <A NAME="1528"></A>private man or statesman, proposes laws
and so becomes the author of a political treatise, <A NAME="1529"></A>fancying
that there is any great certainty and clearness in his performance, the
fact of his <A NAME="1530"></A>so writing is only a disgrace to him, whatever
men may say. For not to know the nature of justice <A NAME="1531"></A>and
injustice, and good and evil, and not to be able to distinguish the dream
from the reality, <A NAME="1532"></A>cannot in truth be otherwise than
disgraceful to him, even though he have the applause of the <A NAME="1533"></A>whole
world. <A NAME="1534"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="1535"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> But he who thinks that in the written word there is necessarily
much which <A NAME="1536"></A>is not serious, and that neither poetry nor
prose, spoken or written, is of any great value, <A NAME="1537"></A>if,
like the compositions of the rhapsodes, they are only recited in order
to be believed, <A NAME="1538"></A>and not with any view to criticism or
instruction; and who thinks that even the best of writings <A NAME="1539"></A>are
but a reminiscence of what we know, and that only in principles of justice
and goodness <A NAME="1540"></A>and nobility taught and communicated orally
for the sake of instruction and graven in the soul, <A NAME="1541"></A>which
is the true way of writing, is there clearness and perfection and seriousness,
and that <A NAME="1542"></A>such principles are a man's own and his legitimate
offspring;-being, in the first place, the <A NAME="1543"></A>word which
he finds in his own bosom; secondly, the brethren and descendants and relations
<A NAME="1544"></A>of his others;-and who cares for them and no others-this
is the right sort of man; and you <A NAME="1545"></A>and I, Phaedrus, would
pray that we may become like him. <A NAME="1546"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> That is most assuredly my desire and prayer. <A NAME="1547"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And now the play is played out; and of rhetoric enough. Go
and tell Lysias <A NAME="1548"></A>that to the fountain and school of the
Nymphs we went down, and were bidden by them to convey <A NAME="1549"></A>a
message to him and to other composers of speeches-to Homer and other writers
of poems, whether <A NAME="1550"></A>set to music or not; and to Solon
and others who have composed writings in the form of political <A NAME="1551"></A>discourses
which they would term laws-to all of them we are to say that if their compositions
<A NAME="1552"></A>are based on knowledge of the truth, and they can defend
or prove them, when they are put to <A NAME="1553"></A>the test, by spoken
arguments, which leave their writings poor in comparison of them, then
<A NAME="1554"></A>they are to be called, not only poets, orators, legislators,
but are worthy of a higher name, <A NAME="1555"></A>befitting the serious
pursuit of their life. <A NAME="1556"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What name would you assign to them? <A NAME="1557"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Wise, I may not call them; for that is a great name which belongs
to God <A NAME="1558"></A>alone,-lovers of wisdom or philosophers is their
modest and befitting title. <A NAME="1559"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Very suitable. <A NAME="1560"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> And he who cannot rise above his own compilations and compositions,
which <A NAME="1561"></A>he has been long patching, and piecing, adding
some and taking away some, may be justly called <A NAME="1562"></A>poet
or speech-maker or law-maker. <A NAME="1563"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Certainly. <A NAME="1564"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Now go and tell this to your companion. <A NAME="1565"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> But there is also a friend of yours who ought not to be
forgotten. <A NAME="1566"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Who is he? <A NAME="1567"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Isocrates the fair:-What message will you send to him, and
how shall <A NAME="1568"></A>we describe him? <A NAME="1569"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Isocrates is still young, Phaedrus; but I am willing to hazard
a prophecy <A NAME="1570"></A>concerning him. <A NAME="1571"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> What would you prophesy? <A NAME="1572"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> I think that he has a genius which soars above the orations
of Lysias, <A NAME="1573"></A>and that his character is cast in a finer
mould. My impression of him is that he will marvelously <A NAME="1574"></A>improve
as he grows older, and that all former rhetoricians will be as children
in comparison <A NAME="1575"></A>of him. And I believe that he will not
be satisfied with rhetoric, but that there is in him <A NAME="1576"></A>a
divine inspiration which will lead him to things higher still. For he has
an element of philosophy <A NAME="1577"></A>in his nature. This is the
message of the gods dwelling in this place, and which I will myself <A NAME="1578"></A>deliver
to Isocrates, who is my delight; and do you give the other to Lysias, who
is yours. <A NAME="1579"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> I will; and now as the heat is abated let us depart. <A NAME="1580"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Should we not offer up a prayer first of all to the local deities?
<A NAME="1581"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> By all means. <A NAME="1582"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Beloved Pan, and all ye other gods who haunt this place, give
me beauty <A NAME="1583"></A>in the inward soul; and may the outward and
inward man be at one. May I reckon the wise to <A NAME="1584"></A>be the
wealthy, and may I have such a quantity of gold as a temperate man and
he only can bear <A NAME="1585"></A>and carry.-Anything more? The prayer,
I think, is enough for me. <A NAME="1586"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Phaedr.</B> Ask the same for me, for friends should have all things
in common. <A NAME="1587"></A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Soc.</B> Let us go. <A NAME="1588"></A><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE END</B> <BR>
