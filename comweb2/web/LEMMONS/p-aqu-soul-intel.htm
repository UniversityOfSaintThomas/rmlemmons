<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I.76.1: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS
ITS FORM? </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG><STRONG><EM>N.B. This is an important question because if it is granted that the intellect can act and exist
independently of matter, then it is possible that individual human beings could lack such an
intellect and that as a result individual human beings would not be immortal. This question
was big during the Middle Ages due to the influence of  Arabic philosophers. It is once again
important for three reasons. First, if the intellect or the intellectual soul is the form of the
human body, then it would be impossible for the human body to be alive apart from the
animating presence of one's personal soul. If this is the case, then it is relevant for various 
bio-ethical questions, e.g. whether a person is still alive when his neocortex is destroyed.
Secondly, if it is the intellectual soul that animates matter into the human body, then
Cartesian dualism. Thirdly, if  Aquinas is successful in identifying the intellect as being
within the soul of each person and if he is successful in identifying the human soul as the
form activating matter into the human body, then he proves both that human beings can be
personally immortal and that the transmigration of human souls into different bodies is
impossible.  This proof begins in this article and is completed in articles I.76.2-3-4-5-8] </EM></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>OBJ 2: Further, every form is determined according to the nature of the matter of which it
is the form; otherwise no proportion would be required between matter and form.
Therefore if the intellect were united to the body as its form, since every body has a
determinate nature, it would follow that the intellect has a determinate nature; and thus, it
would not be capable of knowing all things, as is clear from what has been said (Q75, A2);
which is contrary to the nature of the intellect. Therefore the intellect is not united to the
body as its form. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>OBJ 3: Further, whatever receptive power is an act of a body, receives a form materially
and individually; for what is received must be received according to the condition of the
receiver. But the form of the thing understood is not received into the intellect materially
and individually, but rather immaterially and universally: otherwise the intellect would not
be capable of the knowledge of immaterial and universal objects, but only of individuals,
like the senses. Therefore the intellect is not united to the body as its form. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>OBJ 4: Further, power and action have the same subject; for the same subject is what can,
and does, act. But the intellectual action is not the action of a body, as appears from above
(Q75, A2). Therefore neither is the intellectual faculty a power of the body. But virtue or
power cannot be more abstract or more simple than the essence from which the faculty or
power is derived. Therefore neither is the substance of the intellect the form of a body. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I answer that, We must assert that the intellect which is the principle of intellectual
operation is the form of the human body. For that whereby primarily anything acts is a
form of the thing to which the act is to be attributed: for instance, that whereby a body is
primarily healed is health, and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge; hence
health is a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the soul. The reason is because
nothing acts except so far as it is in act; therefore a thing acts by that whereby it is in act.
Now it is clear that the first thing by which the body lives is the soul. And as life appears
through various operations in different degrees of living things, that whereby we primarily
perform each of all these vital actions is the soul. For the soul is the primary principle of
our nourishment, sensation, and local movement; and likewise of our understanding.
Therefore this principle by which we primarily understand, whether it be called the
intellect or the intellectual soul, is the form of the body. This is the demonstration used by
<EM>Aristotle</EM> (De Anima ii, 2). </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of the body he must first explain
how it is that this action of understanding is the action of this particular man; for each one
is conscious that it is himself who understands. Now an action may be attributed to anyone
in three ways, as is clear from the Philosopher (Phys. v, 1); for a thing is said to move or
act, either by virtue of its whole self, for instance, as a physician heals; or by virtue of a
part, as a man sees by his eye; or through an accidental quality, as when we say that
something that is white builds, because it is accidental to the builder to be white. So when
we say that Socrates or <EM>Plato</EM> understands, it is clear that this is not attributed to him
accidentally; since it is ascribed to him as man, which is predicated of him essentially. We
must therefore say either that Socrates understands by virtue of his whole self, as <EM>Plato</EM>
maintained, holding that man is an intellectual soul; or that intelligence is a part of
Socrates. The first cannot stand, as was shown above (Q75, A4), for this reason, that it is
one and the same man who is conscious both that he understands, and that he senses. But
one cannot sense without a body: therefore the body must be some part of man. It follows
therefore that the intellect by which Socrates understands is a part of Socrates, so that in
some way it is united to the body of Socrates. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>The Commentator held that this union is through the <EM>intelligible species</EM>, as having a double
subject, in the possible intellect, and in the sense images which are in the corporeal organs.
Thus through the <EM>intelligible species</EM> the possible intellect is linked to the body of this or
that particular man. But this link or union does not sufficiently explain the fact, that the
act of the intellect is the act of Socrates. This can be clearly seen from comparison with the
sensitive faculty, from which <EM>Aristotle</EM> proceeds to consider things relating to the intellect.
For the relation of sense images to the intellect is like the relation of colors to the sense of
sight, as he says De Anima iii, 5,7. Therefore, as the species of colors are in the sight, so are
the species of sense images in the possible intellect. Now it is clear that because the colors,
the images of which are in the sight, are on a wall, the action of seeing is not attributed to
the wall: for we do not say that the wall sees, but rather that it is seen. Therefore, from the
fact that the species of sense images are in the possible intellect, it does not follow that
Socrates, in whom are the sense images, understands, but that he or his sense images are
understood. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Some, however, tried to maintain that the intellect is united to the body as its motor; and
hence that the intellect and body form one thing so that the act of the intellect could be
attributed to the whole. This is, however, absurd for many reasons. First, because the
intellect does not move the body except through the appetite, the movement of which
presupposes the operation of the intellect. The reason therefore why Socrates understands
is not because he is moved by his intellect, but rather, contrariwise, he is moved by his
intellect because he understands. Secondly, because since Socrates is an individual in a
nature of one essence composed of matter and form, if the intellect be not the form, it
follows that it must be outside the essence, and then the intellect is the whole Socrates as a
motor to the thing moved. Whereas the act of intellect remains in the agent, and does not
pass into something else, as does the action of heating. Therefore the action of
understanding cannot be attributed to Socrates for the reason that he is moved by his
intellect. Thirdly, because the action of a motor is never attributed to the thing moved,
except as to an instrument; as the action of a carpenter to a saw. Therefore if
understanding is attributed to Socrates, as the action of what moves him, it follows that it is
attributed to him as to an instrument. This is contrary to the teaching of the Philosopher,
who holds that understanding is not possible through a corporeal instrument (De Anima iii,
4). Fourthly, because, although the action of a part be attributed to the whole, as the action
of the eye is attributed to a man; yet it is never attributed to another part, except perhaps
indirectly; for we do not say that the hand sees because the eye sees. Therefore if the
intellect and Socrates are united in the above manner, the action of the intellect cannot be
attributed to Socrates. If, however, Socrates be a whole composed of a union of the intellect
with whatever else belongs to Socrates, and still the intellect be united to those other things
only as a motor, it follows that Socrates is not one absolutely, and consequently neither a
being absolutely, for a thing is a being according as it is one. </STRONG><STRONG>There remains, therefore, no
other explanation than that given by Aristotle---namely, that this particular man
understands, because the intellectual principle is his form. Thus from the very operation of
the intellect it is made clear that the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>The same can be clearly shown from the nature of the human species. For the nature of
each thing is shown by its operation. Now the proper operation of man as man is to
understand; because he thereby surpasses all other animals. Whence <EM>Aristotle</EM> concludes
(Ethic. x, 7) that the ultimate happiness of man must consist in this operation as properly
belonging to him. Man must therefore derive his species from that which is the principle of
this operation. But the species of anything is derived from its form. It follows therefore that
the intellectual principle is the proper form of man. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>But we must observe that the nobler a form is, the more it rises above corporeal matter, the
less it is merged in matter, and the more it excels matter by its power and its operation;
hence we find that the form of a mixed body has another operation not caused by its
elemental qualities. And the higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find
that the power of the form excels the elementary matter; as the vegetative soul excels the
form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excels the vegetative soul. Now the human soul is
the highest and noblest of forms. Therefore it excels corporeal matter in its power by the
fact that it has an operation and a power in which corporeal matter has no share whatever.
This power is called the intellect. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soul is composed of matter and form, it
would follow that in no way could the soul be the form of the body. For since the form is an
act, and matter is only in potentiality, that which is composed of matter and form cannot
itself be the form of another by virtue of itself as a whole. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 2 &amp; 3: From this it is clear how to answer the Second and Third objections:
since, in order that man may be able to understand all things by means of his intellect, and
that his intellect may understand immaterial things and universals, it is sufficient that the
intellectual power be not the act of the body. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 4: The human soul, by reason of its perfection, is not a form merged in matter,
or entirely embraced by matter. Therefore there is nothing to prevent some power thereof
not being the act of the body, although the soul is essentially the form of the body. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I.76.2: WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HUMAN BEINGS SHARE ONE
INTELLECT? </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><EM>N.B. If Aquinas were to claim that humans share one intellect, then his philosophy would be
analogous to various pantheistic beliefs, e.g. the belief that human soul is Brahman.</EM></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I answer that, It is absolutely impossible for one intellect to belong to all men. This is clear
if, as <EM>Plato</EM> maintained, man is the intellect itself. For it would follow that Socrates and
<EM>Plato</EM> are one man; and that they are not distinct from each other, except by something
outside the essence of each. The distinction between <EM>Socrates</EM> and <EM>Plato</EM> would be no other
than that of one man with a tunic and another with a cloak; which is quite absurd. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>It is likewise clear that this is impossible if, according to the opinion of <EM>Aristotle</EM> (De Anima
ii, 2), it is supposed that the intellect is a part or a power of the soul which is the form of
man. For it is impossible for many distinct individuals to have one form, as it is impossible
for them to have one existence, for the form is the principle of existence. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Again, this is clearly impossible, whatever one may hold as to the manner of the union of
the intellect to this or that man. For it is manifest that .... if there is one intellect, no matter
how diverse may be all those things of which the intellect makes use as instruments, in no
way is it possible to say that <EM>Socrates</EM> and <EM>Plato</EM> are otherwise than one understanding man.
And if to this we add that to understand, which is the act of the intellect, is not affected by
any organ other than the intellect itself; it will further follow that there is but one agent
and one action: that is to say that all men are but one . . . and have but one act of
understanding, in regard, that is, of one intelligible object. .... It follows, therefore, that it is
altogether impossible and unreasonable to maintain that there exists one intellect for all
men. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I. 76.3: WHETHER BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN
OTHER SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER? </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><EM>ARTICLE COMMENTARY: If Aquinas is correct in arguing that every human being has
only one soul, then it is impossible for "humanoid animals" to exist (i.e. no human body can
live without the animating presence of the intellectual soul). Death thus occurs when the soul
ceases to animate matter into a living body. This means that when some one suffers
"neocortical death" they are still alive even though the brain's destruction precludes thought.
It thus becomes matter of ethics to decide how to treat such persons appropriately. See the
following article for additional clarification. </EM></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>OBJ 1: It would seem that besides the intellectual soul there are in man other souls
essentially different from one another, such as the sensitive soul and the nutritive soul. For
corruptible and incorruptible are not of the same substance. But the intellectual soul is
incorruptible; whereas the other souls, as the sensitive and the nutritive, are corruptible, as
was shown above (Q75, A6). Therefore in man the essence of the intellectual soul, the
sensitive soul, and the nutritive soul, cannot be the same. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I answer that, <EM>Plato</EM> held that there were several souls in one body, distinct even as to
organs, to which souls he referred the different vital actions, saying that the nutritive
power is in the liver, the concupiscible in the heart, and the power of knowledge in the
brain. Which opinion is rejected by <EM>Aristotle</EM> (De Anima ii, 2), with regard to those parts of
the soul which use corporeal organs; for this reason, that in those animals which continue
to live when they have been divided in each part are observed the operations of the soul, as
sense and appetite. Now this would not be the case if the various principles of the soul's
operations were essentially different, and distributed in the various parts of the body. But
with regard to the intellectual part, he seems to leave it in doubt whether it be "only
logically" distinct from the other parts of the soul, "or also locally." </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>The opinion of <EM>Plato</EM> might be maintained if, as he held, the soul was supposed to be united
to the body, not as its form, but as its motor. For it involves nothing unreasonable that the
same movable thing be moved by several motors; and still less if it be moved according to
its various parts. If we suppose, however, that the soul is united to the body as its form, it is
quite impossible for several essentially different souls to be in one body. This can be made
clear by <EM>three different reasons.</EM> </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>In the <EM>first</EM> place, an animal would not be absolutely one, in which there were several souls.
For nothing is absolutely one except by one form, by which a thing has existence: because a
thing has from the same source both existence and unity; and therefore things which are
denominated by various forms are not absolutely one; as, for instance, "a white man." If,
therefore, man were 'living' by one form, the vegetative soul, and 'animal' by another form,
the sensitive soul, and "man" by another form, the intellectual soul, it would follow that
man is not absolutely one. Thus <EM>Aristotle</EM> argues, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6), against <EM>Plato</EM>,
that if the idea of an animal is distinct from the idea of a biped, then a biped animal is not
absolutely one. For this reason, against those who hold that there are several souls in the
body, he asks (De Anima i, 5), "what contains them?"---that is, what makes them one? It
cannot be said that they are united by the one body; because rather does the soul contain
the body and make it one, than the reverse. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG><STRONG><EM>Secondly</EM>, .... <EM>Thirdly</EM>, this is shown to be impossible by the fact that when one operation of
the soul is intense it impedes another, which could never be the case unless the principle of
action were essentially one. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul, the intellectual soul, and the
nutritive soul are numerically one soul. This can easily be explained, if we consider the
differences of species and forms. For we observe that the species and forms of things differ
from one another, as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the animate are
more perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect than plants, and man than
brute animals; and in each of these genera there are various degrees. .... </STRONG> <STRONG>Thus, neither is
<EM>Socrates</EM> a man by one soul, and animal by another; but by one and the same soul he is
both animal and man. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 1: The sensitive soul is incorruptible, not by reason of its being sensitive, but by
reason of its being intellectual. When, therefore, a soul is sensitive only, it is corruptible;
but when with sensibility it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible. For although
sensibility does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot deprive intellectuality of its
incorruptibility. [In other words, the intellectual soul can do what purely sentient and
purely vegetative souls can do without being limited to the functions of these lower souls.
Cf. I.76.4c ". . .there is no other <EM>substantial form</EM> in man besides the intellectual soul; and
that the soul, as it virtually contains the sensitive and nutritive souls, so does it virtually
contain all inferior forms, and itself alone does whatever the imperfect forms do in other
things. The same is to be said of the sensitive soul in brute animals, and of the nutritive soul
in plants, and universally of all more perfect forms with regard to the imperfect." </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>I.76.8: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IN EACH PART OF THE BODY? </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I answer that, As we have said, if the soul were united to the body merely as its motor, we
might say that it is not in each part of the body, but only in one part through which it
would move the others. But since the soul is united to the body as its form, it must
necessarily be in the whole body, and in each part thereof. For it is not an <EM>accidental form</EM>,
but the <EM>substantial form</EM> of the body. Now the <EM>substantial form</EM> perfects not only the whole,
but each part of the whole. For since a whole consists of parts, a form of the whole which
does not give existence to each of the parts of the body, is a form consisting in composition
and order, such as the form of a house; and such a form is accidental. But the soul is a
<EM>substantial form</EM>; and therefore it must be the form and the act, not only of the whole, but
also of each part. Therefore, on the withdrawal of the soul, as we do not speak of an animal
or a man unless equivocally, as we speak of a painted animal or a stone animal; so is it with
the hand, the eye, the flesh and bones, as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 1). A proof of
which is, that <EM>on the withdrawal of the soul, no part of the body retains its proper action</EM>;
although that which retains its species, retains the action of the species. But act is in that
which it actuates: <EM>therefore</EM> the soul must be in the whole body, and in each part thereof. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I.76.5: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS PROPERLY UNITED TO SUCH A
BODY? </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I answer that, ... Now the intellectual soul, as we have seen above (Q55, A2) in the order of
nature, holds the lowest place among intellectual substances; inasmuch as it is not naturally
gifted with the knowledge of truth, as the angels are; but has to gather knowledge from
individual things by way of the senses, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii). But nature never
fails in necessary things: therefore the intellectual soul had to be endowed not only with the
power of understanding, but also with the power of feeling. Now the action of the senses is
not performed without a corporeal instrument. Therefore it behooved the intellectual soul
to be united to a body fitted to be a convenient organ of sense. </STRONG></P>
