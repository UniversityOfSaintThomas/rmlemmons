<P>&nbsp;1 <B>Since we have previously said that one ought to choose that
which is intermediate, not the excess nor the defect, and that the intermediate
is determined by the dictates of reason, let us discuss this</B>. In all
the states we have mentioned, as in all other matters,<I> there is a mark
to which the man who possesses reason looks, and heightens or relaxes his
activity accordingly, and there is a standard which determines the mean
states which we say are intermediate between excess and defect, being in
accordance with right reason.</I> But such a statement, though true, is
by no means illuminating; for in all other pursuits which are objects of
knowledge it is indeed true to say that we must not exert ourselves nor
relax our efforts too much nor too little, but to an intermediate extent
and as right reason dictates; but if a man had only this knowledge he would
be none the wiser--e.g. we should not know what sort of medicines to apply
to our body if some one were to say 'all those which the medical art prescribes,
and which agree with the practice of one who possesses the art'. Hence
it is necessary with regard to the states of the soul also not only that
this true statement should be made, but also that it should be determined
what right reason is and what is the standard that fixes it.

<P><B>&nbsp;We divided the excellences of the soul and said that some are
excellences of character and others of intellect</B>. Now we have discussed
the moral excellences; with regard to the others let us express our view
as follows, beginning with some remarks about the soul. We said before
that there are two parts of the soul--that which possesses reason and that
which is irrational; l<B>et us now draw a similar distinction within the
part which possesses reason</B>. And let it be assumed that <B>there are
two parts which possess reason--one by which we contemplate the kind of
things whose principles cannot be otherwise, and one by which we contemplate
variable things</B>; for where objects differ in kind the part of the soul
answering to each of the two is different in kind, since it is in virtue
of a certain likeness and kinship with their objects that they have the
knowledge they have. Let one of these parts be called the scientific and
the other the calculative; for to deliberate and to calculate are the same
thing, but no one deliberates about what cannot be otherwise. Therefore
the calculative is one part of the faculty which possesses reason. We must,
then, learn what is the best state of each of these two parts; for this
is the excellence of each.

<P>&nbsp;2&nbsp; <I>The excellence of a thing is relative to its proper
function. </I>Now there are three things in the soul which control action
and truth--sensation, thought, desire.

<P>&nbsp;Of these sensation originates no action; this is plain from the
fact that beasts have sensation but no share in action.

<P>&nbsp;What affirmation and negation are in thinking, pursuit and avoidance
are in desire; so that since moral excellence is a state concerned with
choice, and choice is deliberate desire, therefore both the reasoning must
be true and the desire right, if the choice is to be good, and the latter
must pursue just what the former asserts. Now this kind of intellect and
of truth is practical; of the intellect which is contemplative, not practical
nor productive, the good and the bad state are truth and falsity (for this
is the function of everything intellectual); while of the part which is
practical and intellectual the good state is truth in agreement with right
desire<B>.</B>

<P>&nbsp;The origin of action--its efficient, not its final cause--is choice,
and that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end. <B>This
is why choice cannot exist either without thought and intellect or without
a moral state; for good action and its opposite cannot exist without a
combination of intellect and character. </B>Intellect itself, however,
moves nothing, but only the intellect which aims at an end and is practical;
for this rules the productive intellect as well, since every one who makes
makes for an end, and that which is made is not an end in the unqualified
sense (but only relative to something, i.e. of something)--only that which
is done is that; for good action is an end, and desire aims at this. Hence
choice is either desiderative thought or intellectual desire, and such
an origin of action is a man. (Nothing that is past is an object of choice,
e.g. no one chooses to have sacked Troy; for no one deliberates about the
past, but about what is future and contingent, while what is past is not
capable of not having taken place; hence Agathon is right in saying

<P>&nbsp;For this alone is lacking even to God,
<BR>&nbsp;To make undone things that have once been done.)
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;<B>The function of both the intellectual parts, then, is truth.</B>
Therefore the states that are most strictly those in respect of which each
of these parts will reach truth are the excellences of the two parts.

<P>&nbsp;3&nbsp; Let us begin, then, from the beginning, and discuss these
states once more. Let it be assumed that the states by virtue of which
the soul possesses truth by way of affirmation or denial are five in number,
i.e. art, knowledge, practical wisdom, philosophic wisdom, comprehension;
for belief and opinion may be mistaken.

<P>&nbsp;Now what <B>knowledge</B> is, if we are to speak exactly and not
follow mere similarities, is plain from what follows. We all suppose that
what we know is not capable of being otherwise; of things capable of being
otherwise we do not know, when they have passed outside our observation,
whether they exist or not. Therefore the<B> object of knowledge is of necessity.</B>
Therefore it is eternal; for things that are of necessity in the unqualified
sense are all eternal; and things that are eternal are ungenerated and
imperishable. Again, every science is thought to be capable of being taught,
and its object of being learned. And all teaching starts from what is already
known, as we maintain in the Analytics^50 also; for it proceeds sometimes
through induction and sometimes by deduction. Now induction is of first
principles^51 and of the universal and deduction proceeds from universals.
There are therefore principles from which deduction proceeds, which are
not reached by deduction; it is therefore by induction that they are acquired.
Knowledge, then, is a state of capacity to demonstrate, and has the other
limiting characteristics which we specify in the Analytics; for it is when
a man believes in a certain way and the principles are known to him that
he has knowledge, since if they are not better known to him than the conclusion,
he will have his knowledge only incidentally.

<P>&nbsp;Let this, then, be taken as our account of knowledge.

<P>&nbsp;4&nbsp; Among things that can be otherwise are included both things
made and things done; making and acting are different (for their nature
we treat even the discussions outside our school as reliable); so that
the reasoned state of capacity to act is different from the reasoned state
of capacity to make. Nor^52 are they included one in the other; for neither
is acting making nor is making acting. Now since building is an art and
is essentially a reasoned state of capacity to make, and there is neither
any art that is not such a state nor any such state that is not an art,
art is identical with a state of capacity to make, involving a true course
of reasoning. All art is concerned with coming into being, i.e. with contriving
and considering how something may come into being which is capable of either
being or not being, and whose origin is in the maker and not in the thing
made; for art is concerned neither with things that are, or come into being,
by necessity, nor with things that do so in accordance with nature (since
these have their origin in themselves). Making and acting being different,
art must be a matter of making, not of acting. And in a sense chance and
art are concerned with the same objects; as Agathon says, 'art loves chance
and chance loves art'. Art, then, as has been said, is a state concerned
with making, involving a true course of reasoning, and lack of art on the
contrary is a state concerned with making, involving a false course of
reasoning; both are concerned with what can be otherwise.

<P>&nbsp;5&nbsp; Regarding <B>practical wisdom</B> we shall get at the
truth by considering who are the persons we credit with it. Now it is thought
to be a mark of a man of practical wisdom to be able to deliberate well
about what is good and expedient for himself, not in some particular respect,
e.g. about what sorts of thing conduce to health or to strength, but about
what sorts of thing conduce to the good life in general. This is shown
by the fact that we credit men with practical wisdom in some particular
respect when they have calculated well with a view to some good end which
is one of those that are not the object of any art. Thus in general the
man who is capable of deliberating has practical wisdom. Now no one deliberates
about things that cannot be otherwise nor about things that it is impossible
for him to do. Therefore, since knowledge involves demonstration, but there
is no demonstration of things whose first principles can be otherwise (for
all such things might actually be otherwise), and since it is impossible
to deliberate about things that are of necessity, practical wisdom cannot
be knowledge nor art; not knowledge because that which can be done is capable
of being otherwise, not art because action and making are different kinds
of thing. It remains, then, that it is a true and reasoned state of capacity
to act with regard to the things that are good or bad for man. For while
making has an end other than itself, action cannot; for good action itself
is its end. It is for this reason that we think Pericles and men like him
have practical wisdom, viz. because they can see what is good for themselves
and what is good for men in general; we consider that those can do this
who are good at managing households or states. (This is why we call temperance
by this name; we imply that it preserves one's practical wisdom.^53 Now
what it preserves is a belief of the kind we have described. For it is
not any and every belief that pleasant and painful objects destroy and
pervert, e.g. the belief that the triangle has or has not its angles equal
to two right angles, but only beliefs about what is to be done. For the
principles of the things that are done consist in that for the sake of
which they are to be done; but the man who has been ruined by pleasure
or pain forthwith fails to see any such principle--to see that for the
sake of this or because of this he ought to choose and do whatever he chooses
and does; for vice is destructive of the principle.)

<P><B>&nbsp;Practical wisdom, then, must be a reasoned and true state of
capacity to act with regard to human goods.</B> But further, while there
is such a thing as excellence in art, there is no such thing as excellence
in practical wisdom; and in art he who errs willingly is preferable, but
in practical wisdom, as in the excellences he is the reverse. Plainly,
then, practical wisdom is an excellence and not an art. There being two
parts of the soul that possess reason, it must be the excellence of one
of the two, i.e. of that part which forms opinions; for opinion is about
what can be otherwise, and so is practical wisdom. But yet it is not only
a reasoned state; this is shown by the fact that a state of that sort may
be forgotten but practical wisdom cannot.

<P>[text deleted]

<P>&nbsp;It follows that the wise man must not only know what follows from
the first principles, but must also possess truth about the first principles.
<B>Therefore wisdom must be comprehension combined with knowledge--knowledge
of the highest objects which has received as it were its proper completion.</B>

<P>&nbsp;For it would be strange to think that the art of politics, or
practical wisdom, is the best knowledge, since man is not the best thing
in the world. Now if what is healthy or good is different for men and for
fishes, but what is white or straight is always the same, any one would
say that what is wise is the same but what is practically wise is different;
for it is to that which observes well the various matters concerning itself
that one ascribes practical wisdom, and it is to this that one will entrust
such matters. This is why we say that some even of the lower animals have
practical wisdom, viz. those which are found to have a power of foresight
with regard to their own life. It is evident also that wisdom and the art
of politics cannot be the same; for if the state of mind concerned with
a man's own interests is to be called wisdom, there will be many wisdoms;
there will not be one concerned with the good of all animals (any more
than there is one art of medicine for all existing things), but a different
wisdom about the good of each species.

<P>[text deleted]

<P>&nbsp;8&nbsp; <B>Political wisdom and practical wisdom are the same
state of mind, but to be them is not the same.</B> Of the wisdom concerned
with the city, the practical wisdom which plays a controlling part is legislative
wisdom, while that which is related to this as particulars to their universal
is known by the general name 'political wisdom'; this has to do with action
and deliberation, for a decree is a thing to be carried out in the form
of an individual act. This is why the exponents of this art are alone said
to take part in politics; for these alone do things as manual labourers
do things.

<P>&nbsp;Practical wisdom also is identified especially with that form
of it which is concerned with a man himself--with the individual; and this
is known by the general name 'practical wisdom'; of the other kinds one
is called household management, another legislation, the third politics,
and of the last one part is called deliberative and the other judicial.
Now knowing what is good for oneself will be one kind of knowledge, but
is very different from the other kinds; and the man who knows and concerns
himself with his own interests is thought to have practical wisdom, while
politicians are thought to be busybodies; hence the words of Euripides,

<P>&nbsp;But how could I be wise, who might at ease,
<BR>&nbsp;Numbered among the army's multitude,
<BR>&nbsp;Have had an equal share?. . .
<BR>&nbsp;For those who aim too high and do too much. . . .

<P>Those who think thus seek their own good, and consider that one ought
to do so. From this opinion, then, has come the view that such men have
practical wisdom; yet perhaps one's own good cannot exist without household
management, nor without a form of government. Further, how one should order
one's own affairs is not clear and needs inquiry.

<P>&nbsp;What has been said is confirmed by the fact that while young men
become geometricians and mathematicians and wise in matters like these,
it is thought that a young man of practical wisdom cannot be found. The
cause is that such wisdom is concerned not only with universals but with
particulars, which become familiar from experience, but a young man has
no experience, for it is length of time that gives experience; indeed one
might ask this question too, why a boy may become a mathematician, but
not a wise man or a natural scientist. Is it because the objects of mathematics
exist by abstraction, while the first principles of these other subjects
come from experience, and because young men have no conviction about the
latter but merely use the proper language, while the essence of mathematical
objects is plain enough to them?

<P>&nbsp;[text deleted]

<P>&nbsp;<B>Again, the function of man is achieved only in accordance with
practical wisdom as well as with moral excellence; for excellence makes
the aim right, and practical wisdom the things leading to it.</B> (Of the
fourth part of the soul--the nutritive--there is no such excellence; for
there is nothing which it is in its power to do or not to do.)

<P>&nbsp;With regard to our being none the more able to do because of our
practical wisdom what is noble and just, let us begin a little further
back, starting with the following principle. As we say that some people
who do just acts are not necessarily just, i.e. those who do the acts ordained
by the laws either unwillingly or owing to ignorance or for some other
reason and not for the sake of the acts themselves (though, to be sure,
they do what they should and all the things that the good man ought), so
is it, <B>it seems, that in order to be good one must be in a certain state
when one does the several acts, i.e. one must do them as a result of choice
and for the sake of the acts themselves.</B> Now excellence makes the choice
right, but the question of the things which should naturally be done to
carry out our choice belongs not to excellence but to another faculty.
We must devote our attention to these matters and give a clearer statement
about them. There is a faculty which is called cleverness; and this is
such as to be able to do the things that tend towards the mark we have
set before ourselves, and to hit it. Now if the mark be noble, the cleverness
is laudable, but if the mark be bad, the cleverness is mere villainy; hence
we call clever both men of practical wisdom and villains.^59 Practical
wisdom is not the faculty, but it does not exist without this faculty.
And this eye of the soul acquires its formed state not without the aid
of excellence as has been said and is plain; for inferences which deal
with acts to be done are things which involve a starting-point, viz. 'since
the end, i.e. what is best, is of such and such a nature', whatever it
may be (let it for the sake of argument be what we please); and this is
not evident except to the good man; for wickedness perverts us and causes
us to be deceived about the starting-points of action. Therefore it is
evident that it is impossible to be practically wise without being good.

<P>&nbsp;13&nbsp; We must therefore consider excellence also once more;
for virtue too is similarly related; <B>as practical wisdom is to cleverness--not
the same, but like it--so is natural excellence to excellence in the strict
sense. </B>For all men think that each type of character belongs to its
possessors in some sense by nature; for from the very moment of birth we
are just or fitted for self-control or brave or have the other moral qualities;
but yet we seek something else as that which is good in the strict sense--we
seek for the presence of such qualities in another way. For both children
and brutes have the natural dispositions to these qualities, but without
thought these are evidently hurtful. Only we seem to see this much, that,
while one may be led astray by them, as a strong body which moves without
sight may stumble badly because of its lack of sight, still, if a man once
acquires thought that makes a difference in action; and his state, while
still like what it was, will then be excellence in the strict sense. Therefore,
as in the part of us which forms opinions there are two types, cleverness
and practical wisdom, so too in the moral part there are two types, natural
excellence and excellence in the strict sense, and of these the latter
involves practical wisdom. This is why some say that all the excellences
are forms of practical wisdom, and why Socrates in one respect was on the
right track while in another he went astray; in thinking that all the excellences
were forms of practical wisdom he was wrong, but in saying they implied
practical wisdom he was right. This is confirmed by the fact that even
now all men, when they define excellence, after naming the state and its
objects add 'that (state) which is in accordance with the right reason';
now the right reason is that which is in accordance with practical wisdom.
All men, then, seem somehow to divine that this kind of state is excellence,
viz. that which is in accordance with practical wisdom. But we must go
a little further. For it is not merely the state in accordance with right
reason, but the state that implies the presence of right reason, that is
excellence; and practical wisdom is right reason about such matters. Socrates,
then, thought the excellences were forms of reason (for he thought they
were, all of them, forms of knowledge), while we think they involve reason.

<P>&nbsp;<B>It is clear, then, from what has been said, that it is not
possible to be good in the strict sense without practical wisdom, nor practically
wise without moral excellence.</B> But in this way we may also refute the
dialectical argument whereby it might be contended that the excellences
exist in separation from each other; the same man, it might be said, is
not best equipped by nature for all the excellences, so that he will have
already acquired one when he has not yet acquired another. This is possible
in respect of the natural excellences, but not in respect of those in respect
of which a man is called without qualification good; for with the presence
of the one quality, practical wisdom, will be given all the excellences.
And it is plain that, even if it were of no practical value, we should
have needed it because it is the excellence of the part of us in question;
plain too that the choice will not be right without practical wisdom any
more than without excellence;<B> for the one determines the end and the
other makes us do the things that lead to the end.</B>

<P>&nbsp;But again it is not supreme over wisdom, i.e. over the superior
part of us, any more than the art of medicine is over health; for it does
not use it but provides for its coming into being; it issues orders, then,
for its sake, but not to it. Further, to maintain its supremacy would be
like saying that the art of politics rules the gods because it issues orders
about all the affairs of the state.
