<A NAME="start"></A><A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="11"></A>

<P>With these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the discussion;&nbsp;<A NAME="12"></A>but
the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For Glaucon, who&nbsp;<A NAME="13"></A>is
always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus'&nbsp;<A NAME="14"></A>retirement;
he wanted to have the battle out. So he said to me: Socrates,&nbsp;<A NAME="15"></A>do
you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded us,&nbsp;<A NAME="16"></A>that
to be just is always better than to be unjust?&nbsp;<A NAME="17"></A>

<P>I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I&nbsp;<A NAME="18"></A>could.&nbsp;<A NAME="19"></A>
<BR>Then you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now: --How would&nbsp;<A NAME="20"></A>you
arrange goods --are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes,&nbsp;<A NAME="21"></A>and
independently of their consequences, as, for example, harmless pleasures&nbsp;<A NAME="22"></A>and
enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although nothing follows&nbsp;<A NAME="23"></A>from
them?&nbsp;<A NAME="24"></A>

<P>I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I&nbsp;<A NAME="25"></A>replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="26"></A>
<BR>Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,&nbsp;<A NAME="27"></A>health,
which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their&nbsp;<A NAME="28"></A>results?&nbsp;<A NAME="29"></A>

<P>Certainly, I said.&nbsp;<A NAME="30"></A>
<BR>And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the&nbsp;<A NAME="31"></A>care
of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of money-making&nbsp;<A NAME="32"></A>--these
do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and no one would&nbsp;<A NAME="33"></A>choose
them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of some reward or&nbsp;<A NAME="34"></A>result
which flows from them?&nbsp;<A NAME="35"></A>

<P>There is, I said, this third class also. But why do you&nbsp;<A NAME="36"></A>ask?&nbsp;<A NAME="37"></A>
<BR>Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place&nbsp;<A NAME="38"></A>justice?&nbsp;<A NAME="39"></A>

<P>In the highest class, I replied, --among those goods which he who&nbsp;<A NAME="40"></A>would
be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their&nbsp;<A NAME="41"></A>results.&nbsp;<A NAME="42"></A>

<P>Then the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to&nbsp;<A NAME="43"></A>be
reckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued&nbsp;<A NAME="44"></A>for
the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are disagreeable&nbsp;<A NAME="45"></A>and
rather to be avoided.&nbsp;<A NAME="46"></A>

<P>I know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that&nbsp;<A NAME="47"></A>this
was the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he&nbsp;<A NAME="48"></A>censured
justice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be convinced&nbsp;<A NAME="49"></A>by
him.&nbsp;<A NAME="50"></A>

<P>I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then&nbsp;<A NAME="51"></A>I
shall see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like&nbsp;<A NAME="52"></A>a
snake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have&nbsp;<A NAME="53"></A>been;
but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been&nbsp;<A NAME="54"></A>made
clear. Setting aside their rewards and results, I want to know what&nbsp;<A NAME="55"></A>they
are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the soul. If you,&nbsp;<A NAME="56"></A>please,
then, I will revive the argument of Thrasymachus. And first I will&nbsp;<A NAME="57"></A>speak
of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view&nbsp;<A NAME="58"></A>of
them. Secondly, I will show that all men who practise justice do so&nbsp;<A NAME="59"></A>against
their will, of necessity, but not as a good. And thirdly, I will&nbsp;<A NAME="60"></A>argue
that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust is&nbsp;<A NAME="61"></A>after
all better far than the life of the just --if what they say is true,&nbsp;<A NAME="62"></A>Socrates,
since I myself am not of their opinion. But still I acknowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="63"></A>that
I am perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads&nbsp;<A NAME="64"></A>of
others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have never yet&nbsp;<A NAME="65"></A>heard
the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in&nbsp;<A NAME="66"></A>a
satisfactory way. I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself;&nbsp;<A NAME="67"></A>then
I shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom I think that&nbsp;<A NAME="68"></A>I
am most likely to hear this; and therefore I will praise the unjust life&nbsp;<A NAME="69"></A>to
the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking will indicate the&nbsp;<A NAME="70"></A>manner
in which I desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring&nbsp;<A NAME="71"></A>injustice.
Will you say whether you approve of my proposal?&nbsp;<A NAME="72"></A>

<P>Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense&nbsp;<A NAME="73"></A>would
oftener wish to converse.&nbsp;<A NAME="74"></A>

<P>I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin&nbsp;<A NAME="75"></A>by
speaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of&nbsp;<A NAME="76"></A>justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="77"></A>

<P>Glaucon&nbsp;<A NAME="78"></A>

<P>They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,&nbsp;<A NAME="79"></A>evil;
but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have&nbsp;<A NAME="80"></A>both
done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being&nbsp;<A NAME="81"></A>able
to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better&nbsp;<A NAME="82"></A>agree
among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual&nbsp;<A NAME="83"></A>covenants;
and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and&nbsp;<A NAME="84"></A>just.
This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice; --it is&nbsp;<A NAME="85"></A>a
mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="86"></A>and
not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="87"></A>without
the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point&nbsp;<A NAME="88"></A>between
the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and&nbsp;<A NAME="89"></A>honoured
by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. For no man&nbsp;<A NAME="90"></A>who
is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement&nbsp;<A NAME="91"></A>if
he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received&nbsp;<A NAME="92"></A>account,
Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="93"></A>

<P>Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because&nbsp;<A NAME="94"></A>they
have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something&nbsp;<A NAME="95"></A>of
this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do&nbsp;<A NAME="96"></A>what
they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them; then&nbsp;<A NAME="97"></A>we
shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding&nbsp;<A NAME="98"></A>along
the same road, following their interest, which all natures deem to&nbsp;<A NAME="99"></A>be
their good, and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force&nbsp;<A NAME="100"></A>of
law. The liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given&nbsp;<A NAME="101"></A>to
them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by&nbsp;<A NAME="102"></A>Gyges
the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian. According to the tradition, Gyges&nbsp;<A NAME="103"></A>was
a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm,&nbsp;<A NAME="104"></A>and
an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was&nbsp;<A NAME="105"></A>feeding
his flock. Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening,&nbsp;<A NAME="106"></A>where,
among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors,&nbsp;<A NAME="107"></A>at
which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared&nbsp;<A NAME="108"></A>to
him, more than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he&nbsp;<A NAME="109"></A>took
from the finger of the dead and reascended. Now the shepherds met&nbsp;<A NAME="110"></A>together,
according to custom, that they might send their monthly report&nbsp;<A NAME="111"></A>about
the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring&nbsp;<A NAME="112"></A>on
his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the&nbsp;<A NAME="113"></A>collet
of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible&nbsp;<A NAME="114"></A>to
the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were&nbsp;<A NAME="115"></A>no
longer present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring&nbsp;<A NAME="116"></A>he
turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of&nbsp;<A NAME="117"></A>the
ring, and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards&nbsp;<A NAME="118"></A>he
became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived&nbsp;<A NAME="119"></A>to
be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court; where as&nbsp;<A NAME="120"></A>soon
as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help conspired against&nbsp;<A NAME="121"></A>the
king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now that there were&nbsp;<A NAME="122"></A>two
such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the&nbsp;<A NAME="123"></A>other;,no
man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would&nbsp;<A NAME="124"></A>stand
fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his&nbsp;<A NAME="125"></A>own
when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into&nbsp;<A NAME="126"></A>houses
and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison&nbsp;<A NAME="127"></A>whom
he would, and in all respects be like a God among men. Then the actions&nbsp;<A NAME="128"></A>of
the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come&nbsp;<A NAME="129"></A>at
last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof&nbsp;<A NAME="130"></A>that
a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is&nbsp;<A NAME="131"></A>any
good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks&nbsp;<A NAME="132"></A>that
he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in&nbsp;<A NAME="133"></A>their
hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than&nbsp;<A NAME="134"></A>justice,
and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they&nbsp;<A NAME="135"></A>are
right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming&nbsp;<A NAME="136"></A>invisible,
and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he&nbsp;<A NAME="137"></A>would
be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although&nbsp;<A NAME="138"></A>they
would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with&nbsp;<A NAME="139"></A>one
another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice. Enough of&nbsp;<A NAME="140"></A>this.&nbsp;<A NAME="141"></A>

<P>Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just&nbsp;<A NAME="142"></A>and
unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the&nbsp;<A NAME="143"></A>isolation
to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust,&nbsp;<A NAME="144"></A>and
the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either&nbsp;<A NAME="145"></A>of
them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective&nbsp;<A NAME="146"></A>lives.
First, let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft;&nbsp;<A NAME="147"></A>like
the skilful pilot or physician, who knows intuitively his own powers&nbsp;<A NAME="148"></A>and
keeps within their limits, and who, if he fails at any point, is able&nbsp;<A NAME="149"></A>to
recover himself. So let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right&nbsp;<A NAME="150"></A>way,
and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice (he who is&nbsp;<A NAME="151"></A>found
out is nobody): for the highest reach of injustice is: to be deemed&nbsp;<A NAME="152"></A>just
when you are not. Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man&nbsp;<A NAME="153"></A>we
must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction,&nbsp;<A NAME="154"></A>but
we must allow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired&nbsp;<A NAME="155"></A>the
greatest reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step he must&nbsp;<A NAME="156"></A>be
able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if&nbsp;<A NAME="157"></A>any
of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is&nbsp;<A NAME="158"></A>required
his courage and strength, and command of money and friends. And&nbsp;<A NAME="159"></A>at
his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity,&nbsp;<A NAME="160"></A>wishing,
as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. There must be no&nbsp;<A NAME="161"></A>seeming,
for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and&nbsp;<A NAME="162"></A>then
we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for&nbsp;<A NAME="163"></A>the
sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in justice&nbsp;<A NAME="164"></A>only,
and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a state of&nbsp;<A NAME="165"></A>life
the opposite of the former. Let him be the best of men, and let him&nbsp;<A NAME="166"></A>be
thought the worst; then he will have been put to the proof; and we shall&nbsp;<A NAME="167"></A>see
whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences.&nbsp;<A NAME="168"></A>And
let him continue thus to the hour of death; being just and seeming&nbsp;<A NAME="169"></A>to
be unjust. When both have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of&nbsp;<A NAME="170"></A>justice
and the other of injustice, let judgment be given which of them&nbsp;<A NAME="171"></A>is
the happier of the two.&nbsp;<A NAME="172"></A>

<P>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="173"></A>

<P>Heavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish&nbsp;<A NAME="174"></A>them
up for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were&nbsp;<A NAME="175"></A>two
statues.&nbsp;<A NAME="176"></A>

<P>I do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like&nbsp;<A NAME="177"></A>there
is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either&nbsp;<A NAME="178"></A>of
them. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the description&nbsp;<A NAME="179"></A>a
little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that the words which&nbsp;<A NAME="180"></A>follow
are not mine. --Let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists&nbsp;<A NAME="181"></A>of
injustice: They will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="182"></A>will
be scourged, racked, bound --will have his eyes burnt out; and, at&nbsp;<A NAME="183"></A>last,
after suffering every kind of evil, he will be impaled: Then he will&nbsp;<A NAME="184"></A>understand
that he ought to seem only, and not to be, just; the words of&nbsp;<A NAME="185"></A>Aeschylus
may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just. For&nbsp;<A NAME="186"></A>the
unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not live with a view to appearances&nbsp;<A NAME="187"></A>--he
wants to be really unjust and not to seem only:--&nbsp;<A NAME="188"></A>

<P>His mind has a soil deep and fertile,&nbsp;<A NAME="189"></A>
<BR>Out of which spring his prudent counsels. In the first place, he is&nbsp;<A NAME="190"></A>thought
just, and therefore bears rule in the city; he can marry whom he&nbsp;<A NAME="191"></A>will,
and give in marriage to whom he will; also he can trade and deal&nbsp;<A NAME="192"></A>where
he likes, and always to his own advantage, because he has no misgivings&nbsp;<A NAME="193"></A>about
injustice and at every contest, whether in public or private, he&nbsp;<A NAME="194"></A>gets
the better of his antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is&nbsp;<A NAME="195"></A>rich,
and out of his gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies;&nbsp;<A NAME="196"></A>moreover,
he can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly&nbsp;<A NAME="197"></A>and
magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to&nbsp;<A NAME="198"></A>honour
in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely&nbsp;<A NAME="199"></A>to
be dearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men&nbsp;<A NAME="200"></A>are
said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life&nbsp;<A NAME="201"></A>of
the just.&nbsp;<A NAME="202"></A>

<P>Adeimantus -SOCRATES&nbsp;<A NAME="203"></A>

<P>I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus,&nbsp;<A NAME="204"></A>his
brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there&nbsp;<A NAME="205"></A>is
nothing more to be urged?&nbsp;<A NAME="206"></A>

<P>Why, what else is there? I answered.&nbsp;<A NAME="207"></A>
<BR>The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he&nbsp;<A NAME="208"></A>replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="209"></A>
<BR>Well, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother' --if&nbsp;<A NAME="210"></A>he
fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that Glaucon&nbsp;<A NAME="211"></A>has
already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take from me the&nbsp;<A NAME="212"></A>power
of helping justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="213"></A>

<P>Adeimantus&nbsp;<A NAME="214"></A>

<P>Nonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is another&nbsp;<A NAME="215"></A>side
to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice and&nbsp;<A NAME="216"></A>injustice,
which is equally required in order to bring out what I believe&nbsp;<A NAME="217"></A>to
be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their sons and&nbsp;<A NAME="218"></A>their
wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake of justice,&nbsp;<A NAME="219"></A>but
for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of obtaining&nbsp;<A NAME="220"></A>for
him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages, and the like&nbsp;<A NAME="221"></A>which
Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="222"></A>from
the reputation of justice. More, however, is made of appearances by&nbsp;<A NAME="223"></A>this
class of persons than by the others; for they throw in the good opinion&nbsp;<A NAME="224"></A>of
the gods, and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens,&nbsp;<A NAME="225"></A>as
they say, rain upon the pious; and this accords with the testimony of&nbsp;<A NAME="226"></A>the
noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of whom says, that the gods make&nbsp;<A NAME="227"></A>the
oaks of the just--&nbsp;<A NAME="228"></A>

<P>To hear acorns at their summit, and bees I the&nbsp;<A NAME="229"></A>middle;&nbsp;<A NAME="230"></A>
<BR>And the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces. and&nbsp;<A NAME="231"></A>many
other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And Homer has&nbsp;<A NAME="232"></A>a
very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame&nbsp;<A NAME="233"></A>is--&nbsp;<A NAME="234"></A>

<P>As the fame of some blameless king who, like a&nbsp;<A NAME="235"></A>god,&nbsp;<A NAME="236"></A>
<BR>Maintains justice to whom the black earth brings&nbsp;<A NAME="237"></A>forth&nbsp;<A NAME="238"></A>
<BR>Wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit,&nbsp;<A NAME="239"></A>
<BR>And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish. Still&nbsp;<A NAME="240"></A>grander
are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe to&nbsp;<A NAME="241"></A>the
just; they take them down into the world below, where they have the&nbsp;<A NAME="242"></A>saints
lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk, crowned with garlands;&nbsp;<A NAME="243"></A>their
idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest&nbsp;<A NAME="244"></A>meed
of virtue. Some extend their rewards yet further; the posterity, as&nbsp;<A NAME="245"></A>they
say, of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth&nbsp;<A NAME="246"></A>generation.
This is the style in which they praise justice. But about the&nbsp;<A NAME="247"></A>wicked
there is another strain; they bury them in a slough in Hades, and&nbsp;<A NAME="248"></A>make
them carry water in a sieve; also while they are yet living they bring&nbsp;<A NAME="249"></A>them
to infamy, and inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described&nbsp;<A NAME="250"></A>as
the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does&nbsp;<A NAME="251"></A>their
invention supply. Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring&nbsp;<A NAME="252"></A>the
other.&nbsp;<A NAME="253"></A>

<P>Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of&nbsp;<A NAME="254"></A>speaking
about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets,&nbsp;<A NAME="255"></A>but
is found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always&nbsp;<A NAME="256"></A>declaring
that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and toilsome;&nbsp;<A NAME="257"></A>and
that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment, and&nbsp;<A NAME="258"></A>are
only censured by law and opinion. They say also that honesty is for&nbsp;<A NAME="259"></A>the
most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they are quite ready&nbsp;<A NAME="260"></A>to
call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in public and private&nbsp;<A NAME="261"></A>when
they are rich or in any other way influential, while they despise&nbsp;<A NAME="262"></A>and
overlook those who may be weak and poor, even though acknowledging&nbsp;<A NAME="263"></A>them
to be better than the others. But most extraordinary of all is their&nbsp;<A NAME="264"></A>mode
of speaking about virtue and the gods: they say that the gods apportion&nbsp;<A NAME="265"></A>calamity
and misery to many good men, and good and happiness to the wicked.&nbsp;<A NAME="266"></A>And
mendicant prophets go to rich men's doors and persuade them that they&nbsp;<A NAME="267"></A>have
a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a&nbsp;<A NAME="268"></A>man's
own or his ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings&nbsp;<A NAME="269"></A>and
feasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust,&nbsp;<A NAME="270"></A>at
a small cost; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they&nbsp;<A NAME="271"></A>say,
to execute their will. And the poets are the authorities to whom they&nbsp;<A NAME="272"></A>appeal,
now smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod;&nbsp;<A NAME="273"></A>--&nbsp;<A NAME="274"></A>

<P>Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth&nbsp;<A NAME="275"></A>and
her dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil,&nbsp;<A NAME="276"></A>and
a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that the&nbsp;<A NAME="277"></A>gods
may be influenced by men; for he also says:&nbsp;<A NAME="278"></A>

<P>The gods, too, may he turned from their purpose; and men pray to&nbsp;<A NAME="279"></A>them
and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by&nbsp;<A NAME="280"></A>libations
and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed.&nbsp;<A NAME="281"></A>And
they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who were&nbsp;<A NAME="282"></A>children
of the Moon and the Muses --that is what they say --according&nbsp;<A NAME="283"></A>to
which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals,&nbsp;<A NAME="284"></A>but
whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by&nbsp;<A NAME="285"></A>sacrifices
and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at&nbsp;<A NAME="286"></A>the
service of the living and the dead; the latter sort they call mysteries,&nbsp;<A NAME="287"></A>and
they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect them no one&nbsp;<A NAME="288"></A>knows
what awaits us.&nbsp;<A NAME="289"></A>

<P>He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="290"></A>and
vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their&nbsp;<A NAME="291"></A>minds
likely to be affected, my dear Socrates, --those of them, I mean,&nbsp;<A NAME="292"></A>who
are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower,&nbsp;<A NAME="293"></A>and
from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner&nbsp;<A NAME="294"></A>of
persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would&nbsp;<A NAME="295"></A>make
the best of life? Probably the youth will say to himself in the words&nbsp;<A NAME="296"></A>of
Pindar--&nbsp;<A NAME="297"></A>

<P>Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier&nbsp;<A NAME="298"></A>tower
which may he a fortress to me all my days? For what men say is that,&nbsp;<A NAME="299"></A>if
I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none,&nbsp;<A NAME="300"></A>but
the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable. But if, though&nbsp;<A NAME="301"></A>unjust,
I acquire the reputation of justice, a heavenly life is promised&nbsp;<A NAME="302"></A>to
me. Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth&nbsp;<A NAME="303"></A>and
is lord of happiness, to appearance I must devote myself. I will describe&nbsp;<A NAME="304"></A>around
me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior&nbsp;<A NAME="305"></A>of
my house; behind I will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus,&nbsp;<A NAME="306"></A>greatest
of sages, recommends. But I hear some one exclaiming that the&nbsp;<A NAME="307"></A>concealment
of wickedness is often difficult; to which I answer, Nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="308"></A>great
is easy. Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we would be&nbsp;<A NAME="309"></A>happy,
to be the path along which we should proceed. With a view to concealment&nbsp;<A NAME="310"></A>we
will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs. And there are&nbsp;<A NAME="311"></A>professors
of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies;&nbsp;<A NAME="312"></A>and
so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall make unlawful&nbsp;<A NAME="313"></A>gains
and not be punished. Still I hear a voice saying that the gods cannot&nbsp;<A NAME="314"></A>be
deceived, neither can they be compelled. But what if there are no gods?&nbsp;<A NAME="315"></A>or,
suppose them to have no care of human things --why in either case should&nbsp;<A NAME="316"></A>we
mind about concealment? And even if there are gods, and they do care&nbsp;<A NAME="317"></A>about
us, yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of&nbsp;<A NAME="318"></A>the
poets; and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced&nbsp;<A NAME="319"></A>and
turned by 'sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings.' Let&nbsp;<A NAME="320"></A>us
be consistent then, and believe both or neither. If the poets speak&nbsp;<A NAME="321"></A>truly,
why then we had better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice;&nbsp;<A NAME="322"></A>for
if we are just, although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we&nbsp;<A NAME="323"></A>shall
lose the gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep&nbsp;<A NAME="324"></A>the
gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning, the&nbsp;<A NAME="325"></A>gods
will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished. 'But there is a&nbsp;<A NAME="326"></A>world
below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="327"></A>deeds.'
Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there are mysteries&nbsp;<A NAME="328"></A>and
atoning deities, and these have great power. That is what mighty cities&nbsp;<A NAME="329"></A>declare;
and the children of the gods, who were their poets and prophets,&nbsp;<A NAME="330"></A>bear
a like testimony.&nbsp;<A NAME="331"></A>

<P>On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather&nbsp;<A NAME="332"></A>than
the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful&nbsp;<A NAME="333"></A>regard
to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men,&nbsp;<A NAME="334"></A>in
life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest authorities&nbsp;<A NAME="335"></A>tell
us. Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has any superiority&nbsp;<A NAME="336"></A>of
mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour justice; or indeed&nbsp;<A NAME="337"></A>to
refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised? And even if there&nbsp;<A NAME="338"></A>should
be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words, and who&nbsp;<A NAME="339"></A>is
satisfied that justice is best, still he is not angry with the unjust,&nbsp;<A NAME="340"></A>but
is very ready to forgive them, because he also knows that men are not&nbsp;<A NAME="341"></A>just
of their own free will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom&nbsp;<A NAME="342"></A>the
divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or&nbsp;<A NAME="343"></A>who
has attained knowledge of the truth --but no other man. He only blames&nbsp;<A NAME="344"></A>injustice
who, owing to cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the&nbsp;<A NAME="345"></A>power
of being unjust. And this is proved by the fact that when he obtains&nbsp;<A NAME="346"></A>the
power, he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can&nbsp;<A NAME="347"></A>be.&nbsp;<A NAME="348"></A>

<P>The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning&nbsp;<A NAME="349"></A>of
the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were&nbsp;<A NAME="350"></A>to
find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice --beginning with&nbsp;<A NAME="351"></A>the
ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and ending&nbsp;<A NAME="352"></A>with
the men of our own time --no one has ever blamed injustice or praised&nbsp;<A NAME="353"></A>justice
except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits which&nbsp;<A NAME="354"></A>flow
from them. No one has ever adequately described either in verse or&nbsp;<A NAME="355"></A>prose
the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul,&nbsp;<A NAME="356"></A>and
invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of all the things&nbsp;<A NAME="357"></A>of
a man's soul which he has within him, justice is the greatest good,&nbsp;<A NAME="358"></A>and
injustice the greatest evil. Had this been the universal strain, had&nbsp;<A NAME="359"></A>you
sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards, we should not&nbsp;<A NAME="360"></A>have
been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong, but every&nbsp;<A NAME="361"></A>one
would have been his own watchman, because afraid, if he did wrong,&nbsp;<A NAME="362"></A>of
harbouring in himself the greatest of evils. I dare say that Thrasymachus&nbsp;<A NAME="363"></A>and
others would seriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating,&nbsp;<A NAME="364"></A>and
words even stronger than these about justice and injustice, grossly,&nbsp;<A NAME="365"></A>as
I conceive, perverting their true nature. But I speak in this vehement&nbsp;<A NAME="366"></A>manner,
as I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from you&nbsp;<A NAME="367"></A>the
opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority&nbsp;<A NAME="368"></A>which
justice has over injustice, but what effect they have on the possessor&nbsp;<A NAME="369"></A>of
them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him.&nbsp;<A NAME="370"></A>And
please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations; for unless&nbsp;<A NAME="371"></A>you
take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false,&nbsp;<A NAME="372"></A>we
shall say that you do not praise justice, but the appearance of it;&nbsp;<A NAME="373"></A>we
shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark, and&nbsp;<A NAME="374"></A>that
you really agree with Thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another's&nbsp;<A NAME="375"></A>good
and the interest of the stronger, and that injustice is a man's own&nbsp;<A NAME="376"></A>profit
and interest, though injurious to the weaker. Now as you have admitted&nbsp;<A NAME="377"></A>that
justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed&nbsp;<A NAME="378"></A>for
their results, but in a far greater degree for their own sakes --like&nbsp;<A NAME="379"></A>sight
or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural&nbsp;<A NAME="380"></A>and
not merely conventional good --I would ask you in your praise of justice&nbsp;<A NAME="381"></A>to
regard one point only: I mean the essential good and evil which justice&nbsp;<A NAME="382"></A>and
injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others praise justice&nbsp;<A NAME="383"></A>and
censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and&nbsp;<A NAME="384"></A>abusing
the other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them,&nbsp;<A NAME="385"></A>I
am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in&nbsp;<A NAME="386"></A>the
consideration of this question, unless I hear the contrary from your&nbsp;<A NAME="387"></A>own
lips, I expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only prove&nbsp;<A NAME="388"></A>to
us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they either&nbsp;<A NAME="389"></A>of
them do to the possessor of them, which makes the one to be a good and&nbsp;<A NAME="390"></A>the
other an evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and&nbsp;<A NAME="391"></A>men.&nbsp;<A NAME="392"></A>

<P>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS&nbsp;<A NAME="393"></A>

<P>I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but&nbsp;<A NAME="394"></A>on
hearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an illustrious&nbsp;<A NAME="395"></A>father,
that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the admirer&nbsp;<A NAME="396"></A>of
Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves&nbsp;<A NAME="397"></A>at
the battle of Megara:--&nbsp;<A NAME="398"></A>

<P>'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious&nbsp;<A NAME="399"></A>hero.'
The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine&nbsp;<A NAME="400"></A>in
being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice,&nbsp;<A NAME="401"></A>and
remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. And I do believe that&nbsp;<A NAME="402"></A>you
are not convinced --this I infer from your general character, for had&nbsp;<A NAME="403"></A>I
judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But now,&nbsp;<A NAME="404"></A>the
greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in knowing&nbsp;<A NAME="405"></A>what
to say. For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand I feel that&nbsp;<A NAME="406"></A>I
am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to me by the&nbsp;<A NAME="407"></A>fact
that you were not satisfied with the answer which I made to Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<A NAME="408"></A>proving,
as I thought, the superiority which justice has over injustice.&nbsp;<A NAME="409"></A>And
yet I cannot refuse to help, while breath and speech remain to me;&nbsp;<A NAME="410"></A>I
am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice&nbsp;<A NAME="411"></A>is
evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence. And therefore&nbsp;<A NAME="412"></A>I
had best give such help as I can.&nbsp;<A NAME="413"></A>

<P>Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question&nbsp;<A NAME="414"></A>drop,
but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the&nbsp;<A NAME="415"></A>truth,
first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,&nbsp;<A NAME="416"></A>about
their relative advantages. I told them, what I --really thought,&nbsp;<A NAME="417"></A>that
the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very good&nbsp;<A NAME="418"></A>eyes.
Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that we had&nbsp;<A NAME="419"></A>better
adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that a short-sighted&nbsp;<A NAME="420"></A>person
had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance;&nbsp;<A NAME="421"></A>and
it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place&nbsp;<A NAME="422"></A>which
was larger and in which the letters were larger --if they were the&nbsp;<A NAME="423"></A>same
and he could read the larger letters first, and then proceed to the&nbsp;<A NAME="424"></A>lesser
--this would have been thought a rare piece of good&nbsp;<A NAME="425"></A>fortune.&nbsp;<A NAME="426"></A>

<P>Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply&nbsp;<A NAME="427"></A>to
our enquiry?&nbsp;<A NAME="428"></A>

<P>I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our&nbsp;<A NAME="429"></A>enquiry,
is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual,&nbsp;<A NAME="430"></A>and
sometimes as the virtue of a State.&nbsp;<A NAME="431"></A>

<P>True, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="432"></A>
<BR>And is not a State larger than an individual?&nbsp;<A NAME="433"></A>
<BR>It is.&nbsp;<A NAME="434"></A>
<BR>Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and&nbsp;<A NAME="435"></A>more
easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature&nbsp;<A NAME="436"></A>of
justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and secondly&nbsp;<A NAME="437"></A>in
the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing&nbsp;<A NAME="438"></A>them.&nbsp;<A NAME="439"></A>

<P>That, he said, is an excellent proposal.&nbsp;<A NAME="440"></A>
<BR>And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the&nbsp;<A NAME="441"></A>justice
and injustice of the State in process of creation&nbsp;<A NAME="442"></A>also.&nbsp;<A NAME="443"></A>

<P>I dare say.&nbsp;<A NAME="444"></A>
<BR>When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of&nbsp;<A NAME="445"></A>our
search will be more easily discovered.&nbsp;<A NAME="446"></A>

<P>Yes, far more easily.&nbsp;<A NAME="447"></A>
<BR>But ought we to attempt to construct one? I said; for to do so, as&nbsp;<A NAME="448"></A>I
am inclined to think, will be a very serious task. Reflect&nbsp;<A NAME="449"></A>therefore.&nbsp;<A NAME="450"></A>

<P>I have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should&nbsp;<A NAME="451"></A>proceed.&nbsp;<A NAME="452"></A>

<P>A State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind;&nbsp;<A NAME="453"></A>no
one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. Can any other&nbsp;<A NAME="454"></A>origin
of a State be imagined?&nbsp;<A NAME="455"></A>

<P>There can I be no other.&nbsp;<A NAME="456"></A>
<BR>Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply&nbsp;<A NAME="457"></A>them,
one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and when&nbsp;<A NAME="458"></A>these
partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the&nbsp;<A NAME="459"></A>body
of inhabitants is termed a State.&nbsp;<A NAME="460"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="461"></A>
<BR>And they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives,&nbsp;<A NAME="462"></A>under
the idea that the exchange will be for their good.&nbsp;<A NAME="463"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="464"></A>
<BR>Then, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the&nbsp;<A NAME="465"></A>true
creator is necessity, who is the mother of our&nbsp;<A NAME="466"></A>invention.&nbsp;<A NAME="467"></A>

<P>Of course, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="468"></A>
<BR>Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the condition&nbsp;<A NAME="469"></A>of
life and existence.&nbsp;<A NAME="470"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="471"></A>
<BR>The second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the&nbsp;<A NAME="472"></A>like.&nbsp;<A NAME="473"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="474"></A>
<BR>And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand:&nbsp;<A NAME="475"></A>We
may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder, some one&nbsp;<A NAME="476"></A>else
a weaver --shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps some other&nbsp;<A NAME="477"></A>purveyor
to our bodily wants?&nbsp;<A NAME="478"></A>

<P>Quite right.&nbsp;<A NAME="479"></A>
<BR>The barest notion of a State must include four or five&nbsp;<A NAME="480"></A>men.&nbsp;<A NAME="481"></A>
<BR>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="482"></A>
<BR>And how will they proceed? Will each bring the result of his labours&nbsp;<A NAME="483"></A>into
a common stock? --the individual husbandman, for example, producing&nbsp;<A NAME="484"></A>for
four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the&nbsp;<A NAME="485"></A>provision
of food with which he supplies others as well as himself; or&nbsp;<A NAME="486"></A>will
he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing&nbsp;<A NAME="487"></A>for
them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth&nbsp;<A NAME="488"></A>of
the time, and in the remaining three-fourths of his time be employed&nbsp;<A NAME="489"></A>in
making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with&nbsp;<A NAME="490"></A>others,
but supplying himself all his own wants?&nbsp;<A NAME="491"></A>

<P>Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and&nbsp;<A NAME="492"></A>not
at producing everything.&nbsp;<A NAME="493"></A>

<P>Probably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear&nbsp;<A NAME="494"></A>you
say this, I am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there are&nbsp;<A NAME="495"></A>diversities
of natures among us which are adapted to different&nbsp;<A NAME="496"></A>occupations.&nbsp;<A NAME="497"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="498"></A>
<BR>And will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations,&nbsp;<A NAME="499"></A>or
when he has only one?&nbsp;<A NAME="500"></A>

<P>When he has only one.&nbsp;<A NAME="501"></A>
<BR>Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done&nbsp;<A NAME="502"></A>at
the right time?&nbsp;<A NAME="503"></A>

<P>No doubt.&nbsp;<A NAME="504"></A>
<BR>For business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business&nbsp;<A NAME="505"></A>is
at leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make the&nbsp;<A NAME="506"></A>business
his first object.&nbsp;<A NAME="507"></A>

<P>He must.&nbsp;<A NAME="508"></A>
<BR>And if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully&nbsp;<A NAME="509"></A>and
easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is&nbsp;<A NAME="510"></A>natural
to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other&nbsp;<A NAME="511"></A>things.&nbsp;<A NAME="512"></A>

<P>Undoubtedly..&nbsp;<A NAME="513"></A>
<BR>Then more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will&nbsp;<A NAME="514"></A>not
make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture,&nbsp;<A NAME="515"></A>if
they are to be good for anything. Neither will the builder make his&nbsp;<A NAME="516"></A>tools
--and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and&nbsp;<A NAME="517"></A>shoemaker.&nbsp;<A NAME="518"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="519"></A>
<BR>Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers&nbsp;<A NAME="520"></A>in
our little State, which is already beginning to grow?&nbsp;<A NAME="521"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="522"></A>
<BR>Yet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order&nbsp;<A NAME="523"></A>that
our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well&nbsp;<A NAME="524"></A>as
husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces&nbsp;<A NAME="525"></A>and
hides, --still our State will not be very large.&nbsp;<A NAME="526"></A>

<P>That is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains&nbsp;<A NAME="527"></A>all
these.&nbsp;<A NAME="528"></A>

<P>Then, again, there is the situation of the city --to find a place&nbsp;<A NAME="529"></A>where
nothing need be imported is well-nigh impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="530"></A>

<P>Impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="531"></A>
<BR>Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required&nbsp;<A NAME="532"></A>supply
from another city?&nbsp;<A NAME="533"></A>

<P>There must.&nbsp;<A NAME="534"></A>
<BR>But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require&nbsp;<A NAME="535"></A>who
would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.&nbsp;<A NAME="536"></A>

<P>That is certain.&nbsp;<A NAME="537"></A>
<BR>And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for&nbsp;<A NAME="538"></A>themselves,
but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those&nbsp;<A NAME="539"></A>from
whom their wants are supplied.&nbsp;<A NAME="540"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="541"></A>
<BR>Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?&nbsp;<A NAME="542"></A>
<BR>They will.&nbsp;<A NAME="543"></A>
<BR>Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called&nbsp;<A NAME="544"></A>merchants?&nbsp;<A NAME="545"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="546"></A>
<BR>Then we shall want merchants?&nbsp;<A NAME="547"></A>
<BR>We shall.&nbsp;<A NAME="548"></A>
<BR>And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will&nbsp;<A NAME="549"></A>also
be needed, and in considerable numbers?&nbsp;<A NAME="550"></A>

<P>Yes, in considerable numbers.&nbsp;<A NAME="551"></A>
<BR>Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?&nbsp;<A NAME="552"></A>To
secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our principal&nbsp;<A NAME="553"></A>objects
when we formed them into a society and constituted a&nbsp;<A NAME="554"></A>State.&nbsp;<A NAME="555"></A>

<P>Clearly they will buy and sell.&nbsp;<A NAME="556"></A>
<BR>Then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes&nbsp;<A NAME="557"></A>of
exchange.&nbsp;<A NAME="558"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="559"></A>
<BR>Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production&nbsp;<A NAME="560"></A>to
market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with&nbsp;<A NAME="561"></A>him,
--is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the&nbsp;<A NAME="562"></A>market-place?&nbsp;<A NAME="563"></A>

<P>Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake&nbsp;<A NAME="564"></A>the
office of salesmen. In well-ordered States they are commonly those&nbsp;<A NAME="565"></A>who
are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for&nbsp;<A NAME="566"></A>any
other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money&nbsp;<A NAME="567"></A>in
exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from&nbsp;<A NAME="568"></A>those
who desire to buy.&nbsp;<A NAME="569"></A>

<P>This want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State.&nbsp;<A NAME="570"></A>Is
not 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place&nbsp;<A NAME="571"></A>engaged
in buying and selling, while those who wander from one city to&nbsp;<A NAME="572"></A>another
are called merchants?&nbsp;<A NAME="573"></A>

<P>Yes, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="574"></A>
<BR>And there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly&nbsp;<A NAME="575"></A>on
the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength&nbsp;<A NAME="576"></A>for
labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I do not mistake,&nbsp;<A NAME="577"></A>hirelings,
hire being the name which is given to the price of their&nbsp;<A NAME="578"></A>labour.&nbsp;<A NAME="579"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="580"></A>
<BR>Then hirelings will help to make up our population?&nbsp;<A NAME="581"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="582"></A>
<BR>And now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?&nbsp;<A NAME="583"></A>
<BR>I think so.&nbsp;<A NAME="584"></A>
<BR>Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of&nbsp;<A NAME="585"></A>the
State did they spring up?&nbsp;<A NAME="586"></A>

<P>Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. cannot&nbsp;<A NAME="587"></A>imagine
that they are more likely to be found anywhere&nbsp;<A NAME="588"></A>else.&nbsp;<A NAME="589"></A>

<P>I dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; we had&nbsp;<A NAME="590"></A>better
think the matter out, and not shrink from the&nbsp;<A NAME="591"></A>enquiry.&nbsp;<A NAME="592"></A>

<P>Let us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life,&nbsp;<A NAME="593"></A>now
that we have thus established them. Will they not produce corn, and&nbsp;<A NAME="594"></A>wine,
and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves? And when&nbsp;<A NAME="595"></A>they
are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and barefoot,&nbsp;<A NAME="596"></A>but
in winter substantially clothed and shod. They will feed on barley-meal&nbsp;<A NAME="597"></A>and
flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making noble cakes and loaves;&nbsp;<A NAME="598"></A>these
they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves, themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="599"></A>reclining
the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle. And they and their&nbsp;<A NAME="600"></A>children
will feast, drinking of the wine which they have made, wearing&nbsp;<A NAME="601"></A>garlands
on their heads, and hymning the praises of the gods, in happy&nbsp;<A NAME="602"></A>converse
with one another. And they will take care that their families&nbsp;<A NAME="603"></A>do
not exceed their means; having an eye to poverty or&nbsp;<A NAME="604"></A>war.&nbsp;<A NAME="605"></A>

<P>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="606"></A>

<P>But, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish&nbsp;<A NAME="607"></A>to
their meal.&nbsp;<A NAME="608"></A>

<P>True, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a relish-salt,&nbsp;<A NAME="609"></A>and
olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs such as country&nbsp;<A NAME="610"></A>people
prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs, and peas, and beans;&nbsp;<A NAME="611"></A>and
they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at the fire, drinking in&nbsp;<A NAME="612"></A>moderation.
And with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace&nbsp;<A NAME="613"></A>and
health to a good old age, and bequeath a similar life to their children&nbsp;<A NAME="614"></A>after
them.&nbsp;<A NAME="615"></A>

<P>Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of&nbsp;<A NAME="616"></A>pigs,
how else would you feed the beasts?&nbsp;<A NAME="617"></A>

<P>But what would you have, Glaucon? I replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="618"></A>
<BR>Why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.&nbsp;<A NAME="619"></A>People
who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and dine&nbsp;<A NAME="620"></A>off
tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern&nbsp;<A NAME="621"></A>style.&nbsp;<A NAME="622"></A>

<P>Yes, I said, now I understand: the question which you would have&nbsp;<A NAME="623"></A>me
consider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is created;&nbsp;<A NAME="624"></A>and
possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we shall be&nbsp;<A NAME="625"></A>more
likely to see how justice and injustice originate. In my opinion the&nbsp;<A NAME="626"></A>true
and healthy constitution of the State is the one which I have described.&nbsp;<A NAME="627"></A>But
if you wish also to see a State at fever heat, I have no objection.&nbsp;<A NAME="628"></A>For
I suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way&nbsp;<A NAME="629"></A>They
will be for adding sofas, and tables, and other furniture; also dainties,&nbsp;<A NAME="630"></A>and
perfumes, and incense, and courtesans, and cakes, all these not of&nbsp;<A NAME="631"></A>one
sort only, but in every variety; we must go beyond the necessaries&nbsp;<A NAME="632"></A>of
which I was at first speaking, such as houses, and clothes, and shoes:&nbsp;<A NAME="633"></A>the
arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion,&nbsp;<A NAME="634"></A>and
gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be&nbsp;<A NAME="635"></A>procured.&nbsp;<A NAME="636"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="637"></A>
<BR>Then we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State is&nbsp;<A NAME="638"></A>no
longer sufficient. Now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude&nbsp;<A NAME="639"></A>of
callings which are not required by any natural want; such as the whole&nbsp;<A NAME="640"></A>tribe
of hunters and actors, of whom one large class have to do with forms&nbsp;<A NAME="641"></A>and
colours; another will be the votaries of music --poets and their attendant&nbsp;<A NAME="642"></A>train
of rhapsodists, players, dancers, contractors; also makers of divers&nbsp;<A NAME="643"></A>kinds
of articles, including women's dresses. And we shall want more servants.&nbsp;<A NAME="644"></A>Will
not tutors be also in request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and&nbsp;<A NAME="645"></A>barbers,
as well as confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were&nbsp;<A NAME="646"></A>not
needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our State,&nbsp;<A NAME="647"></A>but
are needed now? They must not be forgotten: and there will be animals&nbsp;<A NAME="648"></A>of
many other kinds, if people eat them.&nbsp;<A NAME="649"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="650"></A>
<BR>And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians&nbsp;<A NAME="651"></A>than
before?&nbsp;<A NAME="652"></A>

<P>Much greater.&nbsp;<A NAME="653"></A>
<BR>And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants&nbsp;<A NAME="654"></A>will
be too small now, and not enough?&nbsp;<A NAME="655"></A>

<P>Quite true.&nbsp;<A NAME="656"></A>
<BR>Then a slice of our neighbours' land will be wanted by us for pasture&nbsp;<A NAME="657"></A>and
tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves, they&nbsp;<A NAME="658"></A>exceed
the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the unlimited&nbsp;<A NAME="659"></A>accumulation
of wealth?&nbsp;<A NAME="660"></A>

<P>That, Socrates, will be inevitable.&nbsp;<A NAME="661"></A>
<BR>And so we shall go to war, Glaucon. Shall we not?&nbsp;<A NAME="662"></A>
<BR>Most certainly, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="663"></A>
<BR>Then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus&nbsp;<A NAME="664"></A>much
we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from&nbsp;<A NAME="665"></A>causes
which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States, private&nbsp;<A NAME="666"></A>as
well as public.&nbsp;<A NAME="667"></A>

<P>Undoubtedly.&nbsp;<A NAME="668"></A>
<BR>And our State must once more enlarge; and this time the will be nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="669"></A>short
of a whole army, which will have to go out and fight with the invaders&nbsp;<A NAME="670"></A>for
all that we have, as well as for the things and persons whom we were&nbsp;<A NAME="671"></A>describing
above.&nbsp;<A NAME="672"></A>

<P>Why? he said; are they not capable of defending&nbsp;<A NAME="673"></A>themselves?&nbsp;<A NAME="674"></A>
<BR>No, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged&nbsp;<A NAME="675"></A>by
all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you will&nbsp;<A NAME="676"></A>remember,
was that one man cannot practise many arts with&nbsp;<A NAME="677"></A>success.&nbsp;<A NAME="678"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="679"></A>
<BR>But is not war an art?&nbsp;<A NAME="680"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="681"></A>
<BR>And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?&nbsp;<A NAME="682"></A>
<BR>Quite true.&nbsp;<A NAME="683"></A>
<BR>And the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman, or a weaver,&nbsp;<A NAME="684"></A>a
builder --in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to him&nbsp;<A NAME="685"></A>and
to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature&nbsp;<A NAME="686"></A>fitted,
and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at&nbsp;<A NAME="687"></A>no
other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then he would become&nbsp;<A NAME="688"></A>a
good workman. Now nothing can be more important than that the work of&nbsp;<A NAME="689"></A>a
soldier should be well done. But is war an art so easily acquired that&nbsp;<A NAME="690"></A>a
man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman, or shoemaker, or other&nbsp;<A NAME="691"></A>artisan;
although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player&nbsp;<A NAME="692"></A>who
merely took up the game as a recreation, and had not from his earliest&nbsp;<A NAME="693"></A>years
devoted himself to this and nothing else?&nbsp;<A NAME="694"></A>

<P>No tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence,&nbsp;<A NAME="695"></A>nor
be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has&nbsp;<A NAME="696"></A>never
bestowed any attention upon them. How then will he who takes up a&nbsp;<A NAME="697"></A>shield
or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day, whether&nbsp;<A NAME="698"></A>with
heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?&nbsp;<A NAME="699"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would&nbsp;<A NAME="700"></A>be
beyond price.&nbsp;<A NAME="701"></A>

<P>And the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more time,&nbsp;<A NAME="702"></A>and
skill, and art, and application will be needed by&nbsp;<A NAME="703"></A>him?&nbsp;<A NAME="704"></A>

<P>No doubt, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="705"></A>
<BR>Will he not also require natural aptitude for his&nbsp;<A NAME="706"></A>calling?&nbsp;<A NAME="707"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="708"></A>
<BR>Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted&nbsp;<A NAME="709"></A>for
the task of guarding the city?&nbsp;<A NAME="710"></A>

<P>It will.&nbsp;<A NAME="711"></A>
<BR>And the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be brave&nbsp;<A NAME="712"></A>and
do our best.&nbsp;<A NAME="713"></A>

<P>We must.&nbsp;<A NAME="714"></A>
<BR>Is not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding&nbsp;<A NAME="715"></A>and
watching?&nbsp;<A NAME="716"></A>

<P>What do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="717"></A>
<BR>I mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake&nbsp;<A NAME="718"></A>the
enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught him,&nbsp;<A NAME="719"></A>they
have to fight with him.&nbsp;<A NAME="720"></A>

<P>All these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by&nbsp;<A NAME="721"></A>them.&nbsp;<A NAME="722"></A>
<BR>Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight&nbsp;<A NAME="723"></A>well?&nbsp;<A NAME="724"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="725"></A>
<BR>And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog&nbsp;<A NAME="726"></A>or
any other animal? Have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable&nbsp;<A NAME="727"></A>is
spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to&nbsp;<A NAME="728"></A>be
absolutely fearless and indomitable?&nbsp;<A NAME="729"></A>

<P>I have.&nbsp;<A NAME="730"></A>
<BR>Then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required&nbsp;<A NAME="731"></A>in
the guardian.&nbsp;<A NAME="732"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="733"></A>
<BR>And also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of&nbsp;<A NAME="734"></A>spirit?&nbsp;<A NAME="735"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="736"></A>
<BR>But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another,&nbsp;<A NAME="737"></A>and
with everybody else?&nbsp;<A NAME="738"></A>

<P>A difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he&nbsp;<A NAME="739"></A>replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="740"></A>
<BR>Whereas, I said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and gentle&nbsp;<A NAME="741"></A>to
their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without waiting&nbsp;<A NAME="742"></A>for
their enemies to destroy them.&nbsp;<A NAME="743"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="744"></A>
<BR>What is to be done then? I said; how shall we find a gentle nature&nbsp;<A NAME="745"></A>which
has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the&nbsp;<A NAME="746"></A>other?&nbsp;<A NAME="747"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="748"></A>
<BR>He will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two&nbsp;<A NAME="749"></A>qualities;
and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible; and&nbsp;<A NAME="750"></A>hence
we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="751"></A>

<P>I am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="752"></A>
<BR>Here feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded. My&nbsp;<A NAME="753"></A>friend,
I said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost&nbsp;<A NAME="754"></A>sight
of the image which we had before us.&nbsp;<A NAME="755"></A>

<P>What do you mean? he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="756"></A>
<BR>I mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite&nbsp;<A NAME="757"></A>qualities.&nbsp;<A NAME="758"></A>

<P>And where do you find them?&nbsp;<A NAME="759"></A>
<BR>Many animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog&nbsp;<A NAME="760"></A>is
a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle to&nbsp;<A NAME="761"></A>their
familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to&nbsp;<A NAME="762"></A>strangers.&nbsp;<A NAME="763"></A>

<P>Yes, I know.&nbsp;<A NAME="764"></A>
<BR>Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our&nbsp;<A NAME="765"></A>finding
a guardian who has a similar combination of&nbsp;<A NAME="766"></A>qualities?&nbsp;<A NAME="767"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="768"></A>
<BR>Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited nature,&nbsp;<A NAME="769"></A>need
to have the qualities of a philosopher?&nbsp;<A NAME="770"></A>

<P>I do not apprehend your meaning.&nbsp;<A NAME="771"></A>
<BR>The trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in the&nbsp;<A NAME="772"></A>dog,
and is remarkable in the animal.&nbsp;<A NAME="773"></A>

<P>What trait?&nbsp;<A NAME="774"></A>
<BR>Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance,&nbsp;<A NAME="775"></A>he
welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor the&nbsp;<A NAME="776"></A>other
any good. Did this never strike you as curious?&nbsp;<A NAME="777"></A>

<P>The matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth&nbsp;<A NAME="778"></A>of
your remark.&nbsp;<A NAME="779"></A>

<P>And surely this instinct of the dog is very charming; --your dog&nbsp;<A NAME="780"></A>is
a true philosopher.&nbsp;<A NAME="781"></A>

<P>Why?&nbsp;<A NAME="782"></A>
<BR>Why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy&nbsp;<A NAME="783"></A>only
by the criterion of knowing and not knowing. And must not an animal&nbsp;<A NAME="784"></A>be
a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the&nbsp;<A NAME="785"></A>test
of knowledge and ignorance?&nbsp;<A NAME="786"></A>

<P>Most assuredly.&nbsp;<A NAME="787"></A>
<BR>And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is&nbsp;<A NAME="788"></A>philosophy?&nbsp;<A NAME="789"></A>

<P>They are the same, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="790"></A>
<BR>And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to&nbsp;<A NAME="791"></A>be
gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of&nbsp;<A NAME="792"></A>wisdom
and knowledge?&nbsp;<A NAME="793"></A>

<P>That we may safely affirm.&nbsp;<A NAME="794"></A>
<BR>Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State&nbsp;<A NAME="795"></A>will
require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and&nbsp;<A NAME="796"></A>strength?&nbsp;<A NAME="797"></A>

<P>Undoubtedly.&nbsp;<A NAME="798"></A>
<BR>Then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found&nbsp;<A NAME="799"></A>them,
how are they to be reared and educated? Is not this enquiry which&nbsp;<A NAME="800"></A>may
be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final&nbsp;<A NAME="801"></A>end
--How do justice and injustice grow up in States? for we do not want&nbsp;<A NAME="802"></A>either
to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient&nbsp;<A NAME="803"></A>length.&nbsp;<A NAME="804"></A>

<P>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS&nbsp;<A NAME="805"></A>

<P>Adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to&nbsp;<A NAME="806"></A>us.&nbsp;<A NAME="807"></A>
<BR>Then, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if&nbsp;<A NAME="808"></A>somewhat
long.&nbsp;<A NAME="809"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="810"></A>
<BR>Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our&nbsp;<A NAME="811"></A>story
shall be the education of our heroes.&nbsp;<A NAME="812"></A>

<P>By all means.&nbsp;<A NAME="813"></A>
<BR>And what shall be their education? Can we find a better than the traditional&nbsp;<A NAME="814"></A>sort?
--and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body, and music for&nbsp;<A NAME="815"></A>the
soul.&nbsp;<A NAME="816"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="817"></A>
<BR>Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic&nbsp;<A NAME="818"></A>afterwards?&nbsp;<A NAME="819"></A>

<P>By all means.&nbsp;<A NAME="820"></A>
<BR>And when you speak of music, do you include literature or&nbsp;<A NAME="821"></A>not?&nbsp;<A NAME="822"></A>
<BR>I do.&nbsp;<A NAME="823"></A>
<BR>And literature may be either true or false?&nbsp;<A NAME="824"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="825"></A>
<BR>And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the&nbsp;<A NAME="826"></A>false?&nbsp;<A NAME="827"></A>

<P>I do not understand your meaning, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="828"></A>
<BR>You know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which,&nbsp;<A NAME="829"></A>though
not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious; and these&nbsp;<A NAME="830"></A>stories
are told them when they are not of an age to learn&nbsp;<A NAME="831"></A>gymnastics.&nbsp;<A NAME="832"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="833"></A>
<BR>That was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before&nbsp;<A NAME="834"></A>gymnastics.&nbsp;<A NAME="835"></A>

<P>Quite right, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="836"></A>
<BR>You know also that the beginning is the most important part of any&nbsp;<A NAME="837"></A>work,
especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the&nbsp;<A NAME="838"></A>time
at which the character is being formed and the desired impression&nbsp;<A NAME="839"></A>is
more readily taken.&nbsp;<A NAME="840"></A>

<P>Quite true.&nbsp;<A NAME="841"></A>
<BR>And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales&nbsp;<A NAME="842"></A>which
may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds&nbsp;<A NAME="843"></A>ideas
for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish&nbsp;<A NAME="844"></A>them
to have when they are grown up?&nbsp;<A NAME="845"></A>

<P>We cannot.&nbsp;<A NAME="846"></A>
<BR>Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers&nbsp;<A NAME="847"></A>of
fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good,&nbsp;<A NAME="848"></A>and
reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their&nbsp;<A NAME="849"></A>children
the authorised ones only. Let them fashion the mind with such&nbsp;<A NAME="850"></A>tales,
even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands; but&nbsp;<A NAME="851"></A>most
of those which are now in use must be discarded.&nbsp;<A NAME="852"></A>

<P>Of what tales are you speaking? he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="853"></A>
<BR>You may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for they&nbsp;<A NAME="854"></A>are
necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both&nbsp;<A NAME="855"></A>of
them.&nbsp;<A NAME="856"></A>

<P>Very likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would&nbsp;<A NAME="857"></A>term
the greater.&nbsp;<A NAME="858"></A>

<P>Those, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the&nbsp;<A NAME="859"></A>rest
of the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of&nbsp;<A NAME="860"></A>mankind.&nbsp;<A NAME="861"></A>

<P>But which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find&nbsp;<A NAME="862"></A>with
them?&nbsp;<A NAME="863"></A>

<P>A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie,&nbsp;<A NAME="864"></A>and,
what is more, a bad lie.&nbsp;<A NAME="865"></A>

<P>But when is this fault committed?&nbsp;<A NAME="866"></A>
<BR>Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods&nbsp;<A NAME="867"></A>and
heroes, --as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow&nbsp;<A NAME="868"></A>of
a likeness to the original.&nbsp;<A NAME="869"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but&nbsp;<A NAME="870"></A>what
are the stories which you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="871"></A>

<P>First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies, in high&nbsp;<A NAME="872"></A>places,
which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too,&nbsp;<A NAME="873"></A>--I
mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated on&nbsp;<A NAME="874"></A>him.
The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted&nbsp;<A NAME="875"></A>upon
him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be lightly told&nbsp;<A NAME="876"></A>to
young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had better be buried&nbsp;<A NAME="877"></A>in
silence. But if there is an absolute necessity for their mention, a&nbsp;<A NAME="878"></A>chosen
few might hear them in a mystery, and they should sacrifice not&nbsp;<A NAME="879"></A>a
common [Eleusinian] pig, but some huge and unprocurable victim; and then&nbsp;<A NAME="880"></A>the
number of the hearers will be very few indeed.&nbsp;<A NAME="881"></A>

<P>Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely&nbsp;<A NAME="882"></A>objectionable.&nbsp;<A NAME="883"></A>
<BR>Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State;&nbsp;<A NAME="884"></A>the
young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes&nbsp;<A NAME="885"></A>he
is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises&nbsp;<A NAME="886"></A>his
father when does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following&nbsp;<A NAME="887"></A>the
example of the first and greatest among the gods.&nbsp;<A NAME="888"></A>

<P>I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories&nbsp;<A NAME="889"></A>are
quite unfit to be repeated.&nbsp;<A NAME="890"></A>

<P>Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of&nbsp;<A NAME="891"></A>quarrelling
among themselves as of all things the basest, should any word&nbsp;<A NAME="892"></A>be
said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and fightings of&nbsp;<A NAME="893"></A>the
gods against one another, for they are not true. No, we shall never&nbsp;<A NAME="894"></A>mention
the battles of the giants, or let them be embroidered on garments;&nbsp;<A NAME="895"></A>and
we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and&nbsp;<A NAME="896"></A>heroes
with their friends and relatives. If they would only believe us&nbsp;<A NAME="897"></A>we
would tell them that quarrelling is unholy, and that never up to this&nbsp;<A NAME="898"></A>time
has there been any, quarrel between citizens; this is what old men&nbsp;<A NAME="899"></A>and
old women should begin by telling children; and when they grow up,&nbsp;<A NAME="900"></A>the
poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit.&nbsp;<A NAME="901"></A>But
the narrative of Hephaestus binding Here his mother, or how on another&nbsp;<A NAME="902"></A>occasion
Zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten,&nbsp;<A NAME="903"></A>and
all the battles of the gods in Homer --these tales must not be admitted&nbsp;<A NAME="904"></A>into
our State, whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning&nbsp;<A NAME="905"></A>or
not. For a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is&nbsp;<A NAME="906"></A>literal;
anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely&nbsp;<A NAME="907"></A>to
become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important&nbsp;<A NAME="908"></A>that
the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous&nbsp;<A NAME="909"></A>thoughts.&nbsp;<A NAME="910"></A>

<P>There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are&nbsp;<A NAME="911"></A>such
models to be found and of what tales are you speaking --how shall&nbsp;<A NAME="912"></A>we
answer him?&nbsp;<A NAME="913"></A>

<P>I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets,&nbsp;<A NAME="914"></A>but
founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the&nbsp;<A NAME="915"></A>general
forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits which&nbsp;<A NAME="916"></A>must
be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their&nbsp;<A NAME="917"></A>business.&nbsp;<A NAME="918"></A>

<P>Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which&nbsp;<A NAME="919"></A>you
mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="920"></A>

<P>Something of this kind, I replied: --God is always to be represented&nbsp;<A NAME="921"></A>as
he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic,&nbsp;<A NAME="922"></A>in
which the representation is given.&nbsp;<A NAME="923"></A>

<P>Right.&nbsp;<A NAME="924"></A>
<BR>And is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as&nbsp;<A NAME="925"></A>such?&nbsp;<A NAME="926"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="927"></A>
<BR>And no good thing is hurtful?&nbsp;<A NAME="928"></A>
<BR>No, indeed.&nbsp;<A NAME="929"></A>
<BR>And that which is not hurtful hurts not?&nbsp;<A NAME="930"></A>
<BR>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="931"></A>
<BR>And that which hurts not does no evil?&nbsp;<A NAME="932"></A>
<BR>No.&nbsp;<A NAME="933"></A>
<BR>And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?&nbsp;<A NAME="934"></A>
<BR>Impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="935"></A>
<BR>And the good is advantageous?&nbsp;<A NAME="936"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="937"></A>
<BR>And therefore the cause of well-being?&nbsp;<A NAME="938"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="939"></A>
<BR>It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things,&nbsp;<A NAME="940"></A>but
of the good only?&nbsp;<A NAME="941"></A>

<P>Assuredly.&nbsp;<A NAME="942"></A>
<BR>Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many&nbsp;<A NAME="943"></A>assert,
but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things&nbsp;<A NAME="944"></A>that
occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the&nbsp;<A NAME="945"></A>evils,
and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the&nbsp;<A NAME="946"></A>causes
are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.&nbsp;<A NAME="947"></A>

<P>That appears to me to be most true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="948"></A>
<BR>Then we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty&nbsp;<A NAME="949"></A>of
the folly of saying that two casks Lie at the threshold of Zeus, full&nbsp;<A NAME="950"></A>of
lots, one of good, the other of evil lots, and that he to whom Zeus&nbsp;<A NAME="951"></A>gives
a mixture of the two Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other&nbsp;<A NAME="952"></A>times
with good; but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled&nbsp;<A NAME="953"></A>ill,&nbsp;<A NAME="954"></A>

<P>Him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth. And&nbsp;<A NAME="955"></A>again&nbsp;<A NAME="956"></A>

<P>Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us. And if any one&nbsp;<A NAME="957"></A>asserts
that the violation of oaths and treaties, which was really the&nbsp;<A NAME="958"></A>work
of Pandarus, was brought about by Athene and Zeus, or that the strife&nbsp;<A NAME="959"></A>and
contention of the gods was instigated by Themis and Zeus, he shall&nbsp;<A NAME="960"></A>not
have our approval; neither will we allow our young men to hear the&nbsp;<A NAME="961"></A>words
of Aeschylus, that God plants guilt among men when he desires utterly&nbsp;<A NAME="962"></A>to
destroy a house. And if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe --the&nbsp;<A NAME="963"></A>subject
of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur --or of the house&nbsp;<A NAME="964"></A>of
Pelops, or of the Trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must&nbsp;<A NAME="965"></A>not
permit him to say that these are the works of God, or if they are of&nbsp;<A NAME="966"></A>God,
he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he&nbsp;<A NAME="967"></A>must
say that God did what was just and right, and they were the better&nbsp;<A NAME="968"></A>for
being punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and&nbsp;<A NAME="969"></A>that
God is the author of their misery --the poet is not to be permitted&nbsp;<A NAME="970"></A>to
say; though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require&nbsp;<A NAME="971"></A>to
be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from God; but&nbsp;<A NAME="972"></A>that
God being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously&nbsp;<A NAME="973"></A>denied,
and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one&nbsp;<A NAME="974"></A>whether
old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth. Such a fiction is&nbsp;<A NAME="975"></A>suicidal,
ruinous, impious.&nbsp;<A NAME="976"></A>

<P>I agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to&nbsp;<A NAME="977"></A>the
law.&nbsp;<A NAME="978"></A>

<P>Let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the&nbsp;<A NAME="979"></A>gods,
to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform --that&nbsp;<A NAME="980"></A>God
is not the author of all things, but of good only.&nbsp;<A NAME="981"></A>

<P>That will do, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="982"></A>
<BR>And what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you whether&nbsp;<A NAME="983"></A>God
is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape,&nbsp;<A NAME="984"></A>and
now in another --sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms,&nbsp;<A NAME="985"></A>sometimes
deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations; or is&nbsp;<A NAME="986"></A>he
one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper&nbsp;<A NAME="987"></A>image?&nbsp;<A NAME="988"></A>

<P>I cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.&nbsp;<A NAME="989"></A>
<BR>Well, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must&nbsp;<A NAME="990"></A>be
effected either by the thing itself, or by some other&nbsp;<A NAME="991"></A>thing?&nbsp;<A NAME="992"></A>

<P>Most certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="993"></A>
<BR>And things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered&nbsp;<A NAME="994"></A>or
discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human frame&nbsp;<A NAME="995"></A>is
least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant which&nbsp;<A NAME="996"></A>is
in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the&nbsp;<A NAME="997"></A>sun
or any similar causes.&nbsp;<A NAME="998"></A>

<P>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="999"></A>
<BR>And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged&nbsp;<A NAME="1000"></A>by
any external influence?&nbsp;<A NAME="1001"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1002"></A>
<BR>And the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite&nbsp;<A NAME="1003"></A>things
--furniture, houses, garments; when good and well made, they are&nbsp;<A NAME="1004"></A>least
altered by time and circumstances.&nbsp;<A NAME="1005"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="1006"></A>
<BR>Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both,&nbsp;<A NAME="1007"></A>is
least liable to suffer change from without?&nbsp;<A NAME="1008"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1009"></A>
<BR>But surely God and the things of God are in every way&nbsp;<A NAME="1010"></A>perfect?&nbsp;<A NAME="1011"></A>
<BR>Of course they are.&nbsp;<A NAME="1012"></A>
<BR>Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many&nbsp;<A NAME="1013"></A>shapes?&nbsp;<A NAME="1014"></A>

<P>He cannot.&nbsp;<A NAME="1015"></A>
<BR>But may he not change and transform himself?&nbsp;<A NAME="1016"></A>
<BR>Clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at&nbsp;<A NAME="1017"></A>all.&nbsp;<A NAME="1018"></A>
<BR>And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the&nbsp;<A NAME="1019"></A>worse
and more unsightly?&nbsp;<A NAME="1020"></A>

<P>If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot&nbsp;<A NAME="1021"></A>suppose
him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.&nbsp;<A NAME="1022"></A>

<P>Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or&nbsp;<A NAME="1023"></A>man,
desire to make himself worse?&nbsp;<A NAME="1024"></A>

<P>Impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="1025"></A>
<BR>Then it is impossible that God should ever be willing to change; being,&nbsp;<A NAME="1026"></A>as
is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every god remains&nbsp;<A NAME="1027"></A>absolutely
and for ever in his own form.&nbsp;<A NAME="1028"></A>

<P>That necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.&nbsp;<A NAME="1029"></A>
<BR>Then, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us&nbsp;<A NAME="1030"></A>that&nbsp;<A NAME="1031"></A>

<P>The gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk&nbsp;<A NAME="1032"></A>up
and down cities in all sorts of forms; and let no one slander Proteus&nbsp;<A NAME="1033"></A>and
Thetis, neither let any one, either in tragedy or in any other kind&nbsp;<A NAME="1034"></A>of
poetry, introduce Here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking&nbsp;<A NAME="1035"></A>an
alms&nbsp;<A NAME="1036"></A>

<P>For the life-giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos; --let&nbsp;<A NAME="1037"></A>us
have no more lies of that sort. Neither must we have mothers under the&nbsp;<A NAME="1038"></A>influence
of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these&nbsp;<A NAME="1039"></A>myths
--telling how certain gods, as they say, 'Go about by night in the&nbsp;<A NAME="1040"></A>likeness
of so many strangers and in divers forms'; but let them take heed&nbsp;<A NAME="1041"></A>lest
they make cowards of their children, and at the same time speak blasphemy&nbsp;<A NAME="1042"></A>against
the gods.&nbsp;<A NAME="1043"></A>

<P>Heaven forbid, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1044"></A>
<BR>But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft&nbsp;<A NAME="1045"></A>and
deception they may make us think that they appear in various&nbsp;<A NAME="1046"></A>forms?&nbsp;<A NAME="1047"></A>

<P>Perhaps, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1048"></A>
<BR>Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether&nbsp;<A NAME="1049"></A>in
word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?&nbsp;<A NAME="1050"></A>

<P>I cannot say, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1051"></A>
<BR>Do you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may&nbsp;<A NAME="1052"></A>be
allowed, is hated of gods and men?&nbsp;<A NAME="1053"></A>

<P>What do you mean? he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1054"></A>
<BR>I mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest&nbsp;<A NAME="1055"></A>and
highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; there,&nbsp;<A NAME="1056"></A>above
all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of&nbsp;<A NAME="1057"></A>him.&nbsp;<A NAME="1058"></A>

<P>Still, he said, I do not comprehend you.&nbsp;<A NAME="1059"></A>
<BR>The reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning&nbsp;<A NAME="1060"></A>to
my words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived or&nbsp;<A NAME="1061"></A>uninformed
about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves,&nbsp;<A NAME="1062"></A>which
is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie,&nbsp;<A NAME="1063"></A>is
what mankind least like; --that, I say, is what they utterly&nbsp;<A NAME="1064"></A>detest.&nbsp;<A NAME="1065"></A>

<P>There is nothing more hateful to them.&nbsp;<A NAME="1066"></A>
<BR>And, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him&nbsp;<A NAME="1067"></A>who
is deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only&nbsp;<A NAME="1068"></A>a
kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul,&nbsp;<A NAME="1069"></A>not
pure unadulterated falsehood. Am I not right?&nbsp;<A NAME="1070"></A>

<P>Perfectly right.&nbsp;<A NAME="1071"></A>
<BR>The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by&nbsp;<A NAME="1072"></A>men?&nbsp;<A NAME="1073"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1074"></A>
<BR>Whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful;&nbsp;<A NAME="1075"></A>in
dealing with enemies --that would be an instance; or again, when those&nbsp;<A NAME="1076"></A>whom
we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do&nbsp;<A NAME="1077"></A>some
harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive; also&nbsp;<A NAME="1078"></A>in
the tales of mythology, of which we were just now speaking --because&nbsp;<A NAME="1079"></A>we
do not know the truth about ancient times, we make falsehood as much&nbsp;<A NAME="1080"></A>like
truth as we can, and so turn it to account.&nbsp;<A NAME="1081"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1082"></A>
<BR>But can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he is&nbsp;<A NAME="1083"></A>ignorant
of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to&nbsp;<A NAME="1084"></A>invention?&nbsp;<A NAME="1085"></A>

<P>That would be ridiculous, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1086"></A>
<BR>Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of&nbsp;<A NAME="1087"></A>God?&nbsp;<A NAME="1088"></A>
<BR>I should say not.&nbsp;<A NAME="1089"></A>
<BR>Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of&nbsp;<A NAME="1090"></A>enemies?&nbsp;<A NAME="1091"></A>
<BR>That is inconceivable.&nbsp;<A NAME="1092"></A>
<BR>But he may have friends who are senseless or mad?&nbsp;<A NAME="1093"></A>
<BR>But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of&nbsp;<A NAME="1094"></A>God.&nbsp;<A NAME="1095"></A>
<BR>Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie?&nbsp;<A NAME="1096"></A>
<BR>None whatever.&nbsp;<A NAME="1097"></A>
<BR>Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of&nbsp;<A NAME="1098"></A>falsehood?&nbsp;<A NAME="1099"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1100"></A>
<BR>Then is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes&nbsp;<A NAME="1101"></A>not;
he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking&nbsp;<A NAME="1102"></A>vision.&nbsp;<A NAME="1103"></A>

<P>Your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my&nbsp;<A NAME="1104"></A>own.&nbsp;<A NAME="1105"></A>
<BR>You agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form&nbsp;<A NAME="1106"></A>in
which we should write and speak about divine things. The gods are not&nbsp;<A NAME="1107"></A>magicians
who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in&nbsp;<A NAME="1108"></A>any
way.&nbsp;<A NAME="1109"></A>

<P>I grant that.&nbsp;<A NAME="1110"></A>
<BR>Then, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the lying&nbsp;<A NAME="1111"></A>dream
which Zeus sends to Agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses&nbsp;<A NAME="1112"></A>of
Aeschylus in which Thetis says that Apollo at her&nbsp;<A NAME="1113"></A>nuptials&nbsp;<A NAME="1114"></A>

<P>Was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he&nbsp;<A NAME="1115"></A>long,
and to know no sickness. And when he had spoken of my lot as in all&nbsp;<A NAME="1116"></A>things
blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul.&nbsp;<A NAME="1117"></A>And
I thought that the word of Phoebus being divine and full of prophecy,&nbsp;<A NAME="1118"></A>would
not fail. And now he himself who uttered the strain, he who was present&nbsp;<A NAME="1119"></A>at
the banquet, and who said this --he it is who has slain my&nbsp;<A NAME="1120"></A>son.&nbsp;<A NAME="1121"></A>

<P>These are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse&nbsp;<A NAME="1122"></A>our
anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall&nbsp;<A NAME="1123"></A>we
allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young,&nbsp;<A NAME="1124"></A>meaning,
as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be&nbsp;<A NAME="1125"></A>true
worshippers of the gods and like them.&nbsp;<A NAME="1126"></A>

<P>I entirely agree, be said, in these principles, and promise to&nbsp;<A NAME="1127"></A>make
them my laws.&nbsp;<A NAME="end"></A>
