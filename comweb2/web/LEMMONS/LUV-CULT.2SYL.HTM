<P><STRONG>INTRODUCTION: </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The loves of a people define its culture and when that culture includes rule by law, an
abhorrence of cruelty, and respect for individual freedoms that culture is civilized. Civilization
is thus a cultural expression of love for law, civility and freedom. </P>

<P>	To define culture and civilization in terms of a people's loves gives the political
philosopher a powerful analytical tool: love explains not only the inspiration that energizes a
people but also explains the rise and fall of governments. For example, European communism
and Philippine totalitarianism ended not through the violent overthrow of oppressive
governments but by the peaceful resistance of peoples who loved freedom more than
security/safety.<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> Likewise, the loves of the American people---and, especially, their love of
God<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>---confined their revolutionary fires and enables the colonies to avoid, for the most part,
the terrors of the French revolution which were fed by hatred of the monarchy and of the
Church. Marx was wrong: class hatred does not advance civilization. Love does. Another
example illustrating this point is the American Civil Rights Campaign of the 1960's. Martin
Luther King inspired by Mohandas Gandhi used the American love of God<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> and their
inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to argue that there were laws
denying these rights to African Americans.</P>

<P>	These examples when coupled with my research into moral foundationalism convince
me <EM>not only </EM>that a people is best understood according to their loves <EM>but also</EM> that civilizations
are advanced and preserved when they are expressions of cultural loves for the rule of law,
individual freedom, civility and God.  Thus, if love is a powerful analytical tool for political
philosophers and if civilizations of love embody the hope of human beings, then John Paul II
has been acting as a most excellent political philosopher by using love to analyze recent and
on-going historical changes in Europe and in the world. Indeed, as far as I know, he coined the
phrase "civilization of love." He has also played a critical role in the collapse of European
communism as George Weigel argues in <EM>The Final Revolution</EM>. The Pope's political philosophy
thus receives special attention in this course.</P>

<P>	Political philosophy needs a new tool of analysis especially within the United States;
because, contemporary political philosophers have become concerned that public discourse
defined in terms of America's dominant political philosophy, liberalism, has increasingly
treated the American political system as reducible to the "procedural republic." Love of
process is to replace love of the traditional common goods of law, civility and freedom. The
main impetus for this transformation is due to the cultural popularity of relativism and its
argument that truth promotes intolerance.  Relativism, however, is unable to sustain the natural
law context given to inalienable rights by our Founding Fathers. This is because inalienable
rights are inalienable only if they are absolutes and relativism denies all absolutes. As we shall
see, perceptive liberals recognize the self-refuting nature of relativism and seek to avoid it. But
the cultural popularity of relativism makes redefining liberalism difficult. Yet unless this
redefinition is successful, then the cultural embeddedness of inalienable rights shall diminish
and the American civilization's emphasis upon the inalienable rightness of life shall end. Once
it does those seeking to kill the infirm will be successful in legalizing euthanasia and
establishing a cultural component intolerant towards those who arouse pity. The resulting
culture of death opposes civilizations of love that seek to care for their infirm---not to kill
them.</P>

<P>	Two fundamental questions thus focus this course: (1) what must a people and its
government do to protect and develop the civilization of love; (2) granted that the loudest voice
in favor of the civilization of love now belongs to Christianity what is the proper role---if any---for that voice within American pluralism? <STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>1. To develop the skills of logical analysis and philosophical arguments within the context of
political philosophy.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>2. To determine the structures and institutions necessary to develop and to protect the
civilizations of love.  This objective will be met by undertaking a philosophical analysis of
certain key encyclicals and key speeches of Pope John Paul II.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>3. To identify the fears that have historically silenced, and continue to silence, the religious
voice. This objective will be primarily met by evaluating the historical components of various
course readings.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>4. To identify how religious believers may properly promote within a pluralistic America a
particular view about shaping a people's culture and civilization. This objective will be met by
evaluating the philosophical arguments in <EM>Catholicism and Liberalism</EM> and by examining
whether John Paul II successfully models a way for pluralism to hear the religious voice in his
speeches found in <EM>The Pope In America.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>5. To develop sensitivity to the American cultural perspective on various course topics, e.g.
the proper role for the religious voice, the culture of death, the forms of human happiness etc.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>		Themes central to this course are found in various popular songs, movies
and advertising. Present to the class one of these themes, e.g. the cultural
endorsement of life or the attempt to transform culture in favor of euthanasia. 
VCRs and cassette players will be available. If a song or an excerpt from a
movie or a television show is shown, the lyrics or the video's dialogue must be
printed out and distributed to the class. </P>

themes. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	6. Hand in a summary of your presentation (one typed page). The summary

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know
not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death."
