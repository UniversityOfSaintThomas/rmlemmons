<p><strong>I.83.1: WHETHER MAN HAS FREE-WILL?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 5: Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 5): "According as each one is, such does the end
seem to him." But it is not in our power to be of one quality or another; for this comes to us from nature.
<strong>Therefore</strong> it is natural to us to follow some particular end, and <strong>therefore</strong> we are not free in so doing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On the contrary, It is written (Ecclus. 15:14): "God made man from the beginning, and left him in
the hand of his own counsel"; and the gloss adds: "That is of his free-will."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	I answer that, Man has free-will: otherwise counsels, exhortations, commands, prohibitions,
rewards, and punishments would be in vain. In order to make this evident, we must observe that some
things act without judgment; as a stone moves downwards; and in like manner all things which lack
knowledge. And some act from judgment, but not a free judgment; as brute animals. For the sheep, seeing
the wolf, judges it a thing to be shunned, from a natural and not a free judgment, <strong>because</strong> it judges, not
from reason, but from natural instinct. And the same thing is to be said of any judgment of brute animals.
But man acts from judgment, <strong>because</strong> by his apprehensive power he judges that something should be
avoided or sought. But <strong>because</strong> this judgment, in the case of some particular act, is not from a natural
instinct, but from some act of comparison in the reason, <strong>therefore</strong> he acts from free judgment and retains
the power of being inclined to various things. For reason in contingent matters may follow opposite
courses, as we see in dialectic syllogisms and rhetorical arguments. Now particular operations are
contingent, and <strong>therefore</strong> in such matters the judgment of reason may follow opposite courses, and is not
determinate to one. And forasmuch as man is rational is it necessary that man have a free-will.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 5: Quality in man is of two kinds: natural and adventitious. Now the natural quality
may be in the intellectual part, or in the body and its powers. From the very fact, <strong>therefore</strong>, that man is
such by virtue of a natural quality which is in the intellectual part, he naturally desires his last end, which is
happiness. Which desire, indeed, is a natural desire, and is not subject to free-will, as is clear from what we
have said above (Q82, AA1,2). But on the part of the body and its powers man may be such by virtue of a
natural quality, inasmuch as he is of such a temperament or disposition due to any impression whatever
produced by corporeal causes, which cannot affect the intellectual part, <strong>since</strong> it is not the act of a corporeal
organ. And such as a man is by virtue of a corporeal quality, such also does his end seem to him, <strong>because</strong>
from such a disposition a man is inclined to choose or reject something. But these inclinations are subject to
the judgment of reason, which the lower appetite obeys, as we have said (Q81, A3). <strong>Therefore</strong> this is in no
way prejudicial to free-will.

<p>	The adventitious qualities are habits and passions, by virtue of which a man is inclined to one thing
rather than to another. And yet even these inclinations are subject to the judgment of reason. Such qualities,
too, are subject to reason, as it is in our power either to acquire them, whether by causing them or
disposing ourselves to them, or to reject them. And so there is nothing in this that is repugnant to free-will.

<p><strong>24.1: IS MAN ENDOWED WITH FREE CHOICE?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Difficulties:

<p>	It seems that he is not, for

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 7. Slavery is opposed to freedom. But in man there is found the slavery of sin, <strong>because</strong>
"whoever committeth sin is the servant of sin," as is said in John (8:34). In man, then, there is no freedom
of choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 17. The philosophers define free choice as a free judgment of reason. The judgment of reason,
however, can be constrained by the force of a demonstration. But what is constrained is not free. Man is
<strong>therefore</strong> not endowed with free choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 19. According to the Philosopher, "each person judges of the end in accordance with his own
character." But it is not in our power to be one kind of person rather than another, <strong>since</strong> a man's particular
temperament is had from birth and, as some maintain,  depends upon the arrangement of the stars. It is
<strong>therefore</strong> not in our power to approve this or that end. But every judgment about a course of action is
based upon the end. We are <strong>therefore</strong> not endowed with free choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 20. Free choice is opposed to necessity. But in certain respects the will of man is under
necessity, for he necessarily wills happiness. He <strong>therefore</strong> does not have freedom in regard to all things,
and so is not endowed with free choice in regard to all.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>REPLY:

<p>	Without any doubt it must be affirmed that man is endowed with free choice. The faith obliges us
to this, <strong>since</strong> without free choice there cannot be merit and demerit, or just punishment and reward. Clear
indications, from which it appears that man freely chooses one thing and refuses another, also lead us to
this. Evident reasoning also forces us to this conclusion. Tracing out by its means the origin of free choice
for the purposes of our investigation, we shall proceed as follows.

<p>	Among things which are moved or which act in any way, this difference is found. Some have
within themselves the principle of their motion or operation; and some have it outside themselves, as is the
case with those which are moved violently, "in which the principle is outside and the being subjected to the
violence contributes nothing," as the Philosopher teaches. We cannot hold free choice to be in the latter
inasmuch as they are not the cause of their own motion, whereas a free being is "that which is for its own
sake," as the Philosopher teaches. 

<p>	Among the things whose principle of motion is within themselves some are such as to move
themselves, as animals; but there are some which do not move themselves even though they do have within
themselves some principle of their motion, as heavy and light things. These do not move themselves
<strong>because</strong> they cannot be distinguished into two parts, of which one does the moving and the other is moved.
This double principle is verified in animals. Their motion is consequent upon a principle within them, their
form. <strong>Because</strong> they have this from the being which generated them, they are said to be moved essentially by
their genitor and accidentally by that which removes an obstacle, according to the Philosopher. These are
moved by means of themselves but not by themselves. <strong>Hence</strong> free choice is not found in these either,
<strong>because</strong> they are not their own cause of acting and moving but are set to acting or moving by something
which they have received from another.

<p>	Among those beings which are moved by themselves, the motions of some come from a rational
judgment; those of others, from a natural judgment. Men act and are moved by a rational judgment, for
they deliberate about what is to be done. But all brutes act and are moved by a natural judgment. This is
evident from the fact that all brutes of the same species work in the same way, as all swallows build their
nests alike. It is also evident from the fact that they have judgment in regard to some definite action, but not
in regard to all. <strong>Thus</strong> bees have skill at making nothing but honeycombs; and the same is true of other
animals.

<p>	It is accordingly apparent to anyone who considers the matter aright that judgment about what is to
be done is attributed to brute animals in the same way as motion and action are attributed to inanimate
natural bodies. Just as heavy and light bodies do not move themselves so as to be by that fact the cause of
their own motion, so too brutes do not judge about their own judgment but follow the judgment implanted
in them by God. <strong>Thus</strong> they are not the cause of their own decision nor do they have freedom of choice. But
man, judging about his course of action by the power of reason, can also judge about his own decision
inasmuch as he knows the meaning of an end and of a means to an end, and the relationship of the one with
reference to the other. <strong>Thus</strong> he is his own cause not only in moving but also in judging. He is <strong>therefore</strong>
endowed with free choice--that is to say, with a free judgment about acting or not acting.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Answers to Difficulties:

<p>	Reply OBJ 7. The slavery of sin does not imply force, but either inclination, inasmuch as a
preceding sin in some way leads to following ones, or a deficiency in natural virtue, which is unable to free
itself from the stain of sin once it has subjected itself to it. <strong>Thus</strong> there always remains in man the freedom
from force by which he naturally has free choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 17. The judgment to which freedom is attributed is a judgment of choice, not a
judgment by which a man pronounces upon conclusions in speculative sciences. For choice is a sort of
decision about what has been previously deliberated.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 19. Neither from the heavenly bodies nor from anything else do men acquire from birth
immediately in the intellective soul any disposition by which they are inclined with necessity to choose any
particular end; except that there is in them from their very nature a necessary appetite for their last end,
happiness. But this does not prevent the freedom of choice, <strong>since</strong> different ways to attain that end remain
open to choice. The reason for this is that the heavenly bodies do not have any immediate influence upon
the rational soul.

<p>	There is acquired from birth, however, in the body of the child a certain disposition both from the
power of the heavenly bodies and from inferior causes, which are the semen and the matter of the one
conceived; and by it the soul is in some sense made prone to choose something inasmuch as the choice of
the rational soul is inclined by the passions, which are in the sense appetite, a bodily power dependent upon
the dispositions of the body. But no necessity in choosing is thereby introduced into it, <strong>since</strong> it is within the
power of the rational soul to admit or to repress the passions which arise. Later on, however, a man is
made to be of a certain sort by a habit--either an acquired habit, of which we are the cause, or an infused
habit, which is not given without our consent even though we are not the cause of it. From this habit it
results that the man efficaciously tends to an end consonant with that habit. And yet that habit does not
introduce any necessity or take away the freedom of choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 20. <strong>Since</strong> choice is a judgment about what is to be done or follows such a judgment,
there can be choice only about what falls under our judgment. But in matters of action our judgment is
drawn from the end, just as our judgment about conclusions is drawn from principles. We do not, however,
judge about first principles, examining them, but naturally assent to them and examine all other things in
their light. In the same way, then, when there is question of the objects of appetite, we do not judge about
the last end by any judgment involving discussion and examination, but we naturally approve of it.
Concerning it there is, accordingly, no choice, but there is will. We have in its regard, <strong>therefore</strong>, a free
will, <strong>since</strong> according to Augustine the necessity of natural inclination is not repugnant to freedom; but not a
free judgment, properly speaking, <strong>since</strong> it does not fall under choice.

<p><strong>D.V. 24.2: IS THERE FREE CHOICE IN BRUTES?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Difficulties:

<p>	It seems that there is, for

<p>	OBJ 1. We are said to have free choice in so far as our acts are voluntary. But according to the
Philosopher "children and brutes share in the voluntary." <strong>Thus</strong> here is free choice in brutes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 2. According to the Philosopher in everything which moves itself there is the ability to be
moved and not be moved. But brutes move themselves. There is in them, <strong>therefore</strong>, the ability to be moved
and not be moved. But we are said to be endowed with free choice from the fact that there is in us the
ability to do something. There is, <strong>therefore</strong>, free choice in brutes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 3. Free choice implies two things, judgment and freedom, both of which are to be found in
brutes. They have some judgment about what is to be done, as appears from the fact that they go after one
thing and run from another. They have freedom, <strong>since</strong> they can be moved or not. <strong>Hence</strong> there is in them
free choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 5. That is said to be free which is not obliged to anything. But the soul of a brute is not
obliged to either of two opposites, <strong>because</strong> its power is not determined to one course of action, like the
power of natural things, which always act in the same way. The soul of a brute <strong>therefore</strong> has free choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 7. As the saints point out, it is a sign that man has free choice that he is instigated to good and
withdrawn from evil by commands. But we see brutes enticed by favors, moved by precepts, or made afraid
by threats to do something or to let it alone. Brutes <strong>therefore</strong> have free choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>REPLY:

<p>	Brutes are by no means endowed with free choice. In explanation of this it should be noted that,
<strong>since</strong> three elements concur in our activity: knowledge, appetite, and the activity itself, the whole formal
character of freedom depends upon the manner of knowing. For appetite follows knowledge, <strong>since</strong> there is
appetite only for a good which is proposed to it by a cognitive power. If appetite sometimes seems not to
follow knowledge, this is <strong>because</strong> the appetite and the knowledge are not judged from the same point of
view. Appetite is concerned with a particular object of operation, whereas the judgment of reason is
sometimes concerned with something universal, and this is at times contrary to our appetite. But a judgment
about this particular object of operation here and now can never be contrary to our appetite. A man who
wishes to fornicate, for instance, although he knows in general that fornication is evil, nevertheless judges
this present act of fornication to be good for him and chooses it under the aspect of good. As Dionysius
says, no one acts intending evil.

<p>	Unless there is something to prevent it, a motion or operation follows the appetite. <strong>Thus</strong>, if the
judgment of the cognitive faculty is not in a person's power but is determined for him extrinsically, neither
will his appetite be in his power; and <strong>consequently</strong> neither will his motion or operation be in his power
absolutely. Now judgment is in the power of the one judging in so far as he can judge about his own
judgment; for we can pass judgment upon the things which are in our power. But to judge about one's own
judgment belongs only to reason, which reflects upon its own act and knows the relationships of the things
about which it judges and of those by which it judges. <strong>Hence</strong> the whole root of freedom is located in
reason. Consequently, a being is related to free choice in the same way as it is related to reason.

<p>	Reason is found fully and perfectly only in man. Only in him, <strong>therefore</strong>, is free choice in its full
sense found.

<p>	Brutes have a certain semblance of reason inasmuch as they share in a certain natural prudence,
and in this respect a lower nature in some way attains to the property of a higher. This semblance consists
in the well-regulated judgment which they have about certain things. But they have this judgment from a
natural estimate, not from any deliberation, <strong>since</strong> they are ignorant of the basis of their judgment. On this
account such a judgment does not extend to all things like that of reason, but only to certain determined
objects.

<p>	In like fashion there is in them a certain semblance of free choice inasmuch as they can, according
to their judgment, do or not do one and the same thing. As a result there is in them a sort of conditional
freedom. For they can act if they judge that they should or not act if they do not so judge. But <strong>because</strong> their
judgment is determined to a single course of action, their appetite and activity also are <strong>consequently</strong>
determined to a single course. <strong>Hence</strong> "they are moved by things seen," as Augustine teaches; and as
Damascene says, they are driven by passions, <strong>because</strong> they naturally judge as they do about a particular
thing seen or a particular passion. They are accordingly under the necessity of being moved to flight or
pursuit by the sight of a particular thing or by a passion which is aroused. A sheep, for example, is under
the necessity of fearing and fleeing at the sight of a wolf, and a dog under the influence of the passion of
anger has to bark and pursue, intent upon hurting. But man is not necessarily moved by the things which he
meets or by the passions which arise,

<p><strong>because</strong> he can admit or repress them. <strong>consequently</strong>, man has free choice, but brutes do not.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Answers to Difficulties:

<p>	Reply OBJ 1. "Something voluntary" is held by the Philosopher to be in brutes, not in the sense of
coming from will but in that of being opposed to what is violent. <strong>Thus</strong> the voluntary is said to be in brutes
and in children <strong>because</strong> they act of their accord but not by the exercise of free choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 2. The motive power of brutes considered in itself is not any more inclined to one of
two opposites than to the other. In this sense they are said to be able to be moved or not. But the judgment
by which the motive power is applied to one or the other of the opposites is determined; and so they do not
have free choice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 3. Although there is in brutes a certain indifference in their actions, still there cannot
properly be said to be in them freedom of action, that is, of acting or of not acting. This is so both <strong>because</strong>
their actions, being carried out by the body, can be forced or prevented (which is true not only of brutes but
also of men, so that not even man is said to be free in his action); and also <strong>because</strong>, although there is in
brutes an indifference to acting or not acting if the action is considered in itself, nevertheless, if the relation
of the action to the judgment from which it gets its determination is considered, a certain restriction passes
over even to the actions themselves, so that there cannot be found in them the character of freedom in an
absolute sense. Yet, even granted that there were in brutes some freedom and some judgment, it would still
not follow that they have freedom of judgment, <strong>since</strong> their judgment is naturally determined to a single
pronouncement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 5. Although the motive power in brutes is not determined to one type of action, their
judgment about what is to be done is so determined, as has been said.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 7. Both men and brutes are induced by favors and restrained by chastisements, or by
commands and prohibitions, but in different ways. It is within the power of men when the same things are
similarly represented, whether they be commands or prohibitions, favors or chastisements, to choose or
refuse them by a judgment of reason. In brutes, however, there is a natural judgment so determined that
whatever is proposed or met in one way is accepted or rejected in the same way. It happens, though, that
from the memory of past favors or chastisements brutes apprehend something as friendly and to be pursued
or hoped for, and something else as hostile and to be fled or feared. <strong>Thus</strong> after a beating they are induced
by the passion of fear which arises from it to obey the wish of their instructor. Nor is it necessary that such
things take place in brutes on account of freedom of choice, but on account of the indifference of their
actions.
