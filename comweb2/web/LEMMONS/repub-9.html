<BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="start"></A><A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS&nbsp;<A NAME="11"></A>

<P>Last of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more&nbsp;<A NAME="12"></A>to
ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live,&nbsp;<A NAME="13"></A>in
happiness or in misery?&nbsp;<A NAME="14"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.&nbsp;<A NAME="15"></A>
<BR>There is, however, I said, a previous question which remains&nbsp;<A NAME="16"></A>unanswered.&nbsp;<A NAME="17"></A>

<P>What question?&nbsp;<A NAME="18"></A>
<BR>I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number&nbsp;<A NAME="19"></A>of
the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always&nbsp;<A NAME="20"></A>be
confused.&nbsp;<A NAME="21"></A>

<P>Well, he said, it is not too late to supply the&nbsp;<A NAME="22"></A>omission.&nbsp;<A NAME="23"></A>
<BR>Very true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand:&nbsp;<A NAME="24"></A>Certain
of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be unlawful;&nbsp;<A NAME="25"></A>every
one appears to have them, but in some persons they are controlled&nbsp;<A NAME="26"></A>by
the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail over them-either&nbsp;<A NAME="27"></A>they
are wholly banished or they become few and weak; while in the case&nbsp;<A NAME="28"></A>of
others they are stronger, and there are more of them.&nbsp;<A NAME="29"></A>

<P>Which appetites do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="30"></A>
<BR>I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling&nbsp;<A NAME="31"></A>power
is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or drink,&nbsp;<A NAME="32"></A>starts
up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his desires;&nbsp;<A NAME="33"></A>and
there is no conceivable folly or crime --not excepting incest or any&nbsp;<A NAME="34"></A>other
unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of forbidden food --which&nbsp;<A NAME="35"></A>at
such a time, when he has parted company with all shame and sense, a&nbsp;<A NAME="36"></A>man
may not be ready to commit.&nbsp;<A NAME="37"></A>

<P>Most true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="38"></A>
<BR>But when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going&nbsp;<A NAME="39"></A>to
sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble thoughts&nbsp;<A NAME="40"></A>and
enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having first indulged&nbsp;<A NAME="41"></A>his
appetites neither too much nor too little, but just enough to lay them&nbsp;<A NAME="42"></A>to
sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering&nbsp;<A NAME="43"></A>with
the higher principle --which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction,&nbsp;<A NAME="44"></A>free
to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown, whether&nbsp;<A NAME="45"></A>in
past, present, or future: when again he has allayed the passionate element,&nbsp;<A NAME="46"></A>if
he has a quarrel against any one --I say, when, after pacifying the&nbsp;<A NAME="47"></A>two
irrational principles, he rouses up the third, which is reason, before&nbsp;<A NAME="48"></A>he
takes his rest, then, as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and&nbsp;<A NAME="49"></A>is
least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless&nbsp;<A NAME="50"></A>visions.&nbsp;<A NAME="51"></A>

<P>I quite agree.&nbsp;<A NAME="52"></A>
<BR>In saying this I have been running into a digression; but the point&nbsp;<A NAME="53"></A>which
I desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is&nbsp;<A NAME="54"></A>a
lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. Pray, consider whether&nbsp;<A NAME="55"></A>I
am right, and you agree with me.&nbsp;<A NAME="56"></A>

<P>Yes, I agree.&nbsp;<A NAME="57"></A>
<BR>And now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic&nbsp;<A NAME="58"></A>man.
He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under&nbsp;<A NAME="59"></A>a
miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but discountenanced&nbsp;<A NAME="60"></A>the
unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and ornament?&nbsp;<A NAME="61"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="62"></A>
<BR>And then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort&nbsp;<A NAME="63"></A>of
people, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite&nbsp;<A NAME="64"></A>extreme
from an abhorrence of his father's meanness. At last, being a better&nbsp;<A NAME="65"></A>man
than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until he halted&nbsp;<A NAME="66"></A>midway
and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but of what he&nbsp;<A NAME="67"></A>deemed
moderate indulgence in various pleasures. After this manner the&nbsp;<A NAME="68"></A>democrat
was generated out of the oligarch?&nbsp;<A NAME="69"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so&nbsp;<A NAME="70"></A>still.&nbsp;<A NAME="71"></A>
<BR>And now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive&nbsp;<A NAME="72"></A>this
man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his father's&nbsp;<A NAME="73"></A>principles.&nbsp;<A NAME="74"></A>

<P>I can imagine him.&nbsp;<A NAME="75"></A>
<BR>Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which&nbsp;<A NAME="76"></A>has
already happened to the father: --he is drawn into a perfectly lawless&nbsp;<A NAME="77"></A>life,
which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his father and&nbsp;<A NAME="78"></A>friends
take part with his moderate desires, and the opposite party assist&nbsp;<A NAME="79"></A>the
opposite ones. As soon as these dire magicians and tyrant-makers find&nbsp;<A NAME="80"></A>that
they are losing their hold on him, they contrive to implant in him&nbsp;<A NAME="81"></A>a
master passion, to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts --a sort&nbsp;<A NAME="82"></A>of
monstrous winged drone --that is the only image which will adequately&nbsp;<A NAME="83"></A>describe
him.&nbsp;<A NAME="84"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of&nbsp;<A NAME="85"></A>him.&nbsp;<A NAME="86"></A>
<BR>And when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands&nbsp;<A NAME="87"></A>and
wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let loose, come&nbsp;<A NAME="88"></A>buzzing
around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which&nbsp;<A NAME="89"></A>they
implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this lord of the soul,&nbsp;<A NAME="90"></A>having
Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks out into a frenzy:&nbsp;<A NAME="91"></A>and
if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of&nbsp;<A NAME="92"></A>formation,
and there is in him any sense of shame remaining, to these better&nbsp;<A NAME="93"></A>principles
he puts an end, and casts them forth until he has purged away&nbsp;<A NAME="94"></A>temperance
and brought in madness to the full.&nbsp;<A NAME="95"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is&nbsp;<A NAME="96"></A>generated.&nbsp;<A NAME="97"></A>

<P>And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a&nbsp;<A NAME="98"></A>tyrant?&nbsp;<A NAME="99"></A>
<BR>I should not wonder.&nbsp;<A NAME="100"></A>
<BR>Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a&nbsp;<A NAME="101"></A>tyrant?&nbsp;<A NAME="102"></A>
<BR>He has.&nbsp;<A NAME="103"></A>
<BR>And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind,&nbsp;<A NAME="104"></A>will
fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the&nbsp;<A NAME="105"></A>gods?&nbsp;<A NAME="106"></A>

<P>That he will.&nbsp;<A NAME="107"></A>
<BR>And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being&nbsp;<A NAME="108"></A>when,
either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes&nbsp;<A NAME="109"></A>drunken,
lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that&nbsp;<A NAME="110"></A>so?&nbsp;<A NAME="111"></A>

<P>Assuredly.&nbsp;<A NAME="112"></A>
<BR>Such is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he&nbsp;<A NAME="113"></A>live?&nbsp;<A NAME="114"></A>
<BR>Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell&nbsp;<A NAME="115"></A>me.&nbsp;<A NAME="116"></A>
<BR>I imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will&nbsp;<A NAME="117"></A>be
feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort&nbsp;<A NAME="118"></A>of
thing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the&nbsp;<A NAME="119"></A>concerns
of his soul.&nbsp;<A NAME="120"></A>

<P>That is certain.&nbsp;<A NAME="121"></A>
<BR>Yes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,&nbsp;<A NAME="122"></A>and
their demands are many.&nbsp;<A NAME="123"></A>

<P>They are indeed, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="124"></A>
<BR>His revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.&nbsp;<A NAME="125"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="126"></A>
<BR>Then comes debt and the cutting down of his property.&nbsp;<A NAME="127"></A>
<BR>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="128"></A>
<BR>When he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest&nbsp;<A NAME="129"></A>like
young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them,&nbsp;<A NAME="130"></A>and
especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them,&nbsp;<A NAME="131"></A>is
in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil&nbsp;<A NAME="132"></A>of
his property, in order that he may gratify them?&nbsp;<A NAME="133"></A>

<P>Yes, that is sure to be the case.&nbsp;<A NAME="134"></A>
<BR>He must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains&nbsp;<A NAME="135"></A>and
pangs.&nbsp;<A NAME="136"></A>

<P>He must.&nbsp;<A NAME="137"></A>
<BR>And as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new&nbsp;<A NAME="138"></A>got
the better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger&nbsp;<A NAME="139"></A>will
claim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has spent&nbsp;<A NAME="140"></A>his
own share of the property, he will take a slice of&nbsp;<A NAME="141"></A>theirs.&nbsp;<A NAME="142"></A>

<P>No doubt he will.&nbsp;<A NAME="143"></A>
<BR>And if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all&nbsp;<A NAME="144"></A>to
cheat and deceive them.&nbsp;<A NAME="145"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="146"></A>
<BR>And if he fails, then he will use force and plunder&nbsp;<A NAME="147"></A>them.&nbsp;<A NAME="148"></A>
<BR>Yes, probably.&nbsp;<A NAME="149"></A>
<BR>And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?&nbsp;<A NAME="150"></A>Will
the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over&nbsp;<A NAME="151"></A>them?&nbsp;<A NAME="152"></A>

<P>Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his&nbsp;<A NAME="153"></A>parents.&nbsp;<A NAME="154"></A>

<P>But, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some newfangled love&nbsp;<A NAME="155"></A>of
a harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe&nbsp;<A NAME="156"></A>that
he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary&nbsp;<A NAME="157"></A>to
his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the other,&nbsp;<A NAME="158"></A>when
she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under like circumstances,&nbsp;<A NAME="159"></A>he
would do the same to his withered old father, first and most indispensable&nbsp;<A NAME="160"></A>of
friends, for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the&nbsp;<A NAME="161"></A>reverse
of indispensable?&nbsp;<A NAME="162"></A>

<P>Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.&nbsp;<A NAME="163"></A>
<BR>Truly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and&nbsp;<A NAME="164"></A>mother.&nbsp;<A NAME="165"></A>

<P>He is indeed, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="166"></A>
<BR>He first takes their property, and when that falls, and pleasures are&nbsp;<A NAME="167"></A>beginning
to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a house,&nbsp;<A NAME="168"></A>or
steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds to clear&nbsp;<A NAME="169"></A>a
temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child, and which&nbsp;<A NAME="170"></A>gave
judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those others which&nbsp;<A NAME="171"></A>have
just been emancipated, and are now the bodyguard of love and share&nbsp;<A NAME="172"></A>his
empire. These in his democratic days, when he was still subject to&nbsp;<A NAME="173"></A>the
laws and to his father, were only let loose in the dreams of sleep.&nbsp;<A NAME="174"></A>But
now that he is under the dominion of love, he becomes always and in&nbsp;<A NAME="175"></A>waking
reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only; he will&nbsp;<A NAME="176"></A>commit
the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food, or be guilty of any other&nbsp;<A NAME="177"></A>horrid
act. Love is his tyrant, and lives lordly in him and lawlessly,&nbsp;<A NAME="178"></A>and
being himself a king, leads him on, as a tyrant leads a State, to the&nbsp;<A NAME="179"></A>performance
of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the&nbsp;<A NAME="180"></A>rabble
of his associates, whether those whom evil communications have brought&nbsp;<A NAME="181"></A>in
from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within&nbsp;<A NAME="182"></A>him
by reason of a similar evil nature in himself. Have we not here a picture&nbsp;<A NAME="183"></A>of
his way of life?&nbsp;<A NAME="184"></A>

<P>Yes, indeed, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="185"></A>
<BR>And if there are only a few of them in the State, the rest of the people&nbsp;<A NAME="186"></A>are
well disposed, they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers&nbsp;<A NAME="187"></A>of
some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war; and if there&nbsp;<A NAME="188"></A>is
no war, they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the&nbsp;<A NAME="189"></A>city.&nbsp;<A NAME="190"></A>

<P>What sort of mischief?&nbsp;<A NAME="191"></A>
<BR>For example, they are the thieves, burglars, cutpurses, footpads, robbers&nbsp;<A NAME="192"></A>of
temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to speak&nbsp;<A NAME="193"></A>they
turn informers, and bear false witness, and take&nbsp;<A NAME="194"></A>bribes.&nbsp;<A NAME="195"></A>

<P>A small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are&nbsp;<A NAME="196"></A>few
in number.&nbsp;<A NAME="197"></A>

<P>Yes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all&nbsp;<A NAME="198"></A>these
things, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do&nbsp;<A NAME="199"></A>not
come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class&nbsp;<A NAME="200"></A>and
their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,&nbsp;<A NAME="201"></A>assisted
by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="202"></A>the
one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, and him they create&nbsp;<A NAME="203"></A>their
tyrant.&nbsp;<A NAME="204"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a&nbsp;<A NAME="205"></A>tyrant.&nbsp;<A NAME="206"></A>
<BR>If the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began&nbsp;<A NAME="207"></A>by
beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he beats&nbsp;<A NAME="208"></A>them,
and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the Cretans&nbsp;<A NAME="209"></A>say,
in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be&nbsp;<A NAME="210"></A>their
rulers and masters. This is the end of his passions and&nbsp;<A NAME="211"></A>desires.&nbsp;<A NAME="212"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="213"></A>
<BR>When such men are only private individuals and before they get power,&nbsp;<A NAME="214"></A>this
is their character; they associate entirely with their own flatterers&nbsp;<A NAME="215"></A>or
ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they in their turn&nbsp;<A NAME="216"></A>are
equally ready to bow down before them: they profess every sort of affection&nbsp;<A NAME="217"></A>for
them; but when they have gained their point they know them no&nbsp;<A NAME="218"></A>more.&nbsp;<A NAME="219"></A>

<P>Yes, truly.&nbsp;<A NAME="220"></A>
<BR>They are always either the masters or servants and never the friends&nbsp;<A NAME="221"></A>of
anybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or&nbsp;<A NAME="222"></A>friendship.&nbsp;<A NAME="223"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="224"></A>
<BR>And may we not rightly call such men treacherous?&nbsp;<A NAME="225"></A>
<BR>No question.&nbsp;<A NAME="226"></A>
<BR>Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of&nbsp;<A NAME="227"></A>justice?&nbsp;<A NAME="228"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.&nbsp;<A NAME="229"></A>
<BR>Let us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man:&nbsp;<A NAME="230"></A>he
is the waking reality of what we dreamed.&nbsp;<A NAME="231"></A>

<P>Most true.&nbsp;<A NAME="232"></A>
<BR>And this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and&nbsp;<A NAME="233"></A>the
longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.&nbsp;<A NAME="234"></A>

<P>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="235"></A>

<P>That is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to&nbsp;<A NAME="236"></A>answer.&nbsp;<A NAME="237"></A>
<BR>And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the&nbsp;<A NAME="238"></A>most
miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually&nbsp;<A NAME="239"></A>and
truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in&nbsp;<A NAME="240"></A>general?&nbsp;<A NAME="241"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, inevitably.&nbsp;<A NAME="242"></A>
<BR>And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical, State, and&nbsp;<A NAME="243"></A>the
democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the&nbsp;<A NAME="244"></A>others?&nbsp;<A NAME="245"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="246"></A>
<BR>And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation&nbsp;<A NAME="247"></A>to
man?&nbsp;<A NAME="248"></A>

<P>To be sure.&nbsp;<A NAME="249"></A>
<BR>Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city&nbsp;<A NAME="250"></A>which
is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?&nbsp;<A NAME="251"></A>

<P>They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best&nbsp;<A NAME="252"></A>and
the other is the very worst.&nbsp;<A NAME="253"></A>

<P>There can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore&nbsp;<A NAME="254"></A>I
will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about&nbsp;<A NAME="255"></A>their
relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow ourselves&nbsp;<A NAME="256"></A>to
be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is only a unit&nbsp;<A NAME="257"></A>and
may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us go as we ought&nbsp;<A NAME="258"></A>into
every corner of the city and look all about, and then we will give&nbsp;<A NAME="259"></A>our
opinion.&nbsp;<A NAME="260"></A>

<P>A fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that&nbsp;<A NAME="261"></A>a
tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king&nbsp;<A NAME="262"></A>the
happiest.&nbsp;<A NAME="263"></A>

<P>And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request,&nbsp;<A NAME="264"></A>that
I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human&nbsp;<A NAME="265"></A>nature?
He must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled&nbsp;<A NAME="266"></A>at
the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder,&nbsp;<A NAME="267"></A>but
let him be one who has a clear insight. May I suppose that the judgment&nbsp;<A NAME="268"></A>is
given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge, and has&nbsp;<A NAME="269"></A>dwelt
in the same place with him, and been present at his dally life and&nbsp;<A NAME="270"></A>known
him in his family relations, where he may be seen stripped of his&nbsp;<A NAME="271"></A>tragedy
attire, and again in the hour of public danger --he shall tell&nbsp;<A NAME="272"></A>us
about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other&nbsp;<A NAME="273"></A>men?&nbsp;<A NAME="274"></A>

<P>That again, he said, is a very fair proposal.&nbsp;<A NAME="275"></A>
<BR>Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and&nbsp;<A NAME="276"></A>have
before now met with such a person? We shall then have some one who&nbsp;<A NAME="277"></A>will
answer our enquiries.&nbsp;<A NAME="278"></A>

<P>By all means.&nbsp;<A NAME="279"></A>
<BR>Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the&nbsp;<A NAME="280"></A>State;
bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other&nbsp;<A NAME="281"></A>of
them, will you tell me their respective conditions?&nbsp;<A NAME="282"></A>

<P>What do you mean? he asked.&nbsp;<A NAME="283"></A>
<BR>Beginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which&nbsp;<A NAME="284"></A>is
governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?&nbsp;<A NAME="285"></A>

<P>No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.&nbsp;<A NAME="286"></A>
<BR>And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a&nbsp;<A NAME="287"></A>State?&nbsp;<A NAME="288"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, I see that there are --a few; but the people, speaking&nbsp;<A NAME="289"></A>generally,
and the best of them, are miserably degraded and&nbsp;<A NAME="290"></A>enslaved.&nbsp;<A NAME="291"></A>

<P>Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule&nbsp;<A NAME="292"></A>prevail?
his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity --the best elements&nbsp;<A NAME="293"></A>in
him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the&nbsp;<A NAME="294"></A>worst
and maddest.&nbsp;<A NAME="295"></A>

<P>Inevitably.&nbsp;<A NAME="296"></A>
<BR>And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman,&nbsp;<A NAME="297"></A>or
of a slave?&nbsp;<A NAME="298"></A>

<P>He has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.&nbsp;<A NAME="299"></A>
<BR>And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable&nbsp;<A NAME="300"></A>of
acting voluntarily?&nbsp;<A NAME="301"></A>

<P>Utterly incapable.&nbsp;<A NAME="302"></A>
<BR>And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="303"></A>taken
as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is&nbsp;<A NAME="304"></A>a
gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and&nbsp;<A NAME="305"></A>remorse?&nbsp;<A NAME="306"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="307"></A>
<BR>And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or&nbsp;<A NAME="308"></A>poor?&nbsp;<A NAME="309"></A>
<BR>Poor.&nbsp;<A NAME="310"></A>
<BR>And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and&nbsp;<A NAME="311"></A>insatiable?&nbsp;<A NAME="312"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="313"></A>
<BR>And must not such a State and such a man be always full of&nbsp;<A NAME="314"></A>fear?&nbsp;<A NAME="315"></A>
<BR>Yes, indeed.&nbsp;<A NAME="316"></A>
<BR>Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow&nbsp;<A NAME="317"></A>and
groaning and pain?&nbsp;<A NAME="318"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="319"></A>
<BR>And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery&nbsp;<A NAME="320"></A>than
in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and&nbsp;<A NAME="321"></A>desires?&nbsp;<A NAME="322"></A>

<P>Impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="323"></A>
<BR>Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State&nbsp;<A NAME="324"></A>to
be the most miserable of States?&nbsp;<A NAME="325"></A>

<P>And I was right, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="326"></A>
<BR>Certainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical&nbsp;<A NAME="327"></A>man,
what do you say of him?&nbsp;<A NAME="328"></A>

<P>I say that he is by far the most miserable of all&nbsp;<A NAME="329"></A>men.&nbsp;<A NAME="330"></A>
<BR>There, I said, I think that you are beginning to go&nbsp;<A NAME="331"></A>wrong.&nbsp;<A NAME="332"></A>
<BR>What do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="333"></A>
<BR>I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of&nbsp;<A NAME="334"></A>misery.&nbsp;<A NAME="335"></A>

<P>Then who is more miserable?&nbsp;<A NAME="336"></A>
<BR>One of whom I am about to speak.&nbsp;<A NAME="337"></A>
<BR>Who is that?&nbsp;<A NAME="338"></A>
<BR>He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private&nbsp;<A NAME="339"></A>life
has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public&nbsp;<A NAME="340"></A>tyrant.&nbsp;<A NAME="341"></A>

<P>From what has been said, I gather that you are&nbsp;<A NAME="342"></A>right.&nbsp;<A NAME="343"></A>
<BR>Yes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more&nbsp;<A NAME="344"></A>certain,
and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this respecting&nbsp;<A NAME="345"></A>good
and evil is the greatest.&nbsp;<A NAME="346"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="347"></A>
<BR>Let me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, throw a&nbsp;<A NAME="348"></A>light
upon this subject.&nbsp;<A NAME="349"></A>

<P>What is your illustration?&nbsp;<A NAME="350"></A>
<BR>The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from&nbsp;<A NAME="351"></A>them
you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have&nbsp;<A NAME="352"></A>slaves;
the only difference is that he has more slaves.&nbsp;<A NAME="353"></A>

<P>Yes, that is the difference.&nbsp;<A NAME="354"></A>
<BR>You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from&nbsp;<A NAME="355"></A>their
servants?&nbsp;<A NAME="356"></A>

<P>What should they fear?&nbsp;<A NAME="357"></A>
<BR><B>Nothing.</B> But do you observe the reason of&nbsp;<A NAME="358"></A>this?&nbsp;<A NAME="359"></A>
<BR>Yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the&nbsp;<A NAME="360"></A>protection
of each individual.&nbsp;<A NAME="361"></A>

<P>Very true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master&nbsp;<A NAME="362"></A>say
of some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,&nbsp;<A NAME="363"></A>carried
off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to&nbsp;<A NAME="364"></A>help
him --will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and&nbsp;<A NAME="365"></A>children
should be put to death by his slaves?&nbsp;<A NAME="366"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.&nbsp;<A NAME="367"></A>
<BR>The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of&nbsp;<A NAME="368"></A>his
slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things,&nbsp;<A NAME="369"></A>much
against his will --he will have to cajole his own&nbsp;<A NAME="370"></A>servants.&nbsp;<A NAME="371"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that will be the only way of saving&nbsp;<A NAME="372"></A>himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="373"></A>
<BR>And suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with&nbsp;<A NAME="374"></A>neighbours
who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and&nbsp;<A NAME="375"></A>who,
if they could catch the offender, would take his&nbsp;<A NAME="376"></A>life?&nbsp;<A NAME="377"></A>

<P>His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere&nbsp;<A NAME="378"></A>surrounded
and watched by enemies.&nbsp;<A NAME="379"></A>

<P>And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be&nbsp;<A NAME="380"></A>bound
--he who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all&nbsp;<A NAME="381"></A>sorts
of fears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone,&nbsp;<A NAME="382"></A>of
all men in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or to see&nbsp;<A NAME="383"></A>the
things which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole&nbsp;<A NAME="384"></A>like
a woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who&nbsp;<A NAME="385"></A>goes
into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.&nbsp;<A NAME="386"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="387"></A>
<BR>And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his&nbsp;<A NAME="388"></A>own
person --the tyrannical man, I mean --whom you just now decided to&nbsp;<A NAME="389"></A>be
the most miserable of all --will not he be yet more miserable when,&nbsp;<A NAME="390"></A>instead
of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a&nbsp;<A NAME="391"></A>public
tyrant? He has to be master of others when he is not master of himself:&nbsp;<A NAME="392"></A>he
is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life,&nbsp;<A NAME="393"></A>not
in retirement, but fighting and combating with other&nbsp;<A NAME="394"></A>men.&nbsp;<A NAME="395"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, the similitude is most exact.&nbsp;<A NAME="396"></A>
<BR>Is not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant lead&nbsp;<A NAME="397"></A>a
worse life than he whose life you determined to be the&nbsp;<A NAME="398"></A>worst?&nbsp;<A NAME="399"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="400"></A>
<BR>He who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave,&nbsp;<A NAME="401"></A>and
is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and to&nbsp;<A NAME="402"></A>be
the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which he is utterly&nbsp;<A NAME="403"></A>unable
to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly poor,&nbsp;<A NAME="404"></A>if
you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his life long he&nbsp;<A NAME="405"></A>is
beset with fear and is full of convulsions, and distractions, even as&nbsp;<A NAME="406"></A>the
State which he resembles: and surely the resemblance&nbsp;<A NAME="407"></A>holds?&nbsp;<A NAME="408"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="409"></A>
<BR>Moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power:&nbsp;<A NAME="410"></A>he
becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more unjust,&nbsp;<A NAME="411"></A>more
friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the purveyor&nbsp;<A NAME="412"></A>and
cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is that he is&nbsp;<A NAME="413"></A>supremely
miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable as&nbsp;<A NAME="414"></A>himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="415"></A>

<P>No man of any sense will dispute your words.&nbsp;<A NAME="416"></A>
<BR>Come then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests&nbsp;<A NAME="417"></A>proclaims
the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first in&nbsp;<A NAME="418"></A>the
scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others follow:&nbsp;<A NAME="419"></A>there
are five of them in all --they are the royal, timocratical, oligarchical,&nbsp;<A NAME="420"></A>democratical,
tyrannical.&nbsp;<A NAME="421"></A>

<P>The decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses&nbsp;<A NAME="422"></A>coming
on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they enter,&nbsp;<A NAME="423"></A>by
the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.&nbsp;<A NAME="424"></A>

<P>Need we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston&nbsp;<A NAME="425"></A>(the
best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest,&nbsp;<A NAME="426"></A>and
that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself; and&nbsp;<A NAME="427"></A>that
the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and that&nbsp;<A NAME="428"></A>this
is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest&nbsp;<A NAME="429"></A>tyrant
of his State?&nbsp;<A NAME="430"></A>

<P>Make the proclamation yourself, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="431"></A>
<BR>And shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and&nbsp;<A NAME="432"></A>men'?&nbsp;<A NAME="433"></A>
<BR>Let the words be added.&nbsp;<A NAME="434"></A>
<BR>Then this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is another, which&nbsp;<A NAME="435"></A>may
also have some weight.&nbsp;<A NAME="436"></A>

<P>What is that?&nbsp;<A NAME="437"></A>
<BR>The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that&nbsp;<A NAME="438"></A>the
individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three&nbsp;<A NAME="439"></A>principles,
the division may, I think, furnish a new&nbsp;<A NAME="440"></A>demonstration.&nbsp;<A NAME="441"></A>

<P>Of what nature?&nbsp;<A NAME="442"></A>
<BR>It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond;&nbsp;<A NAME="443"></A>also
three desires and governing powers.&nbsp;<A NAME="444"></A>

<P>How do you mean? he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="445"></A>
<BR>There is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,&nbsp;<A NAME="446"></A>another
with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no special&nbsp;<A NAME="447"></A>name,
but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from the extraordinary&nbsp;<A NAME="448"></A>strength
and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other&nbsp;<A NAME="449"></A>sensual
appetites which are the main elements of it; also money-loving,&nbsp;<A NAME="450"></A>because
such desires are generally satisfied by the help of&nbsp;<A NAME="451"></A>money.&nbsp;<A NAME="452"></A>

<P>That is true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="453"></A>
<BR>If we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were&nbsp;<A NAME="454"></A>concerned
with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single notion;&nbsp;<A NAME="455"></A>and
might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving&nbsp;<A NAME="456"></A>gain
or money.&nbsp;<A NAME="457"></A>

<P>I agree with you.&nbsp;<A NAME="458"></A>
<BR>Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering&nbsp;<A NAME="459"></A>and
getting fame?&nbsp;<A NAME="460"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="461"></A>
<BR>Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious --would the term be&nbsp;<A NAME="462"></A>suitable?&nbsp;<A NAME="463"></A>

<P>Extremely suitable.&nbsp;<A NAME="464"></A>
<BR>On the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge is&nbsp;<A NAME="465"></A>wholly
directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others&nbsp;<A NAME="466"></A>for
gain or fame.&nbsp;<A NAME="467"></A>

<P>Far less.&nbsp;<A NAME="468"></A>
<BR>'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly&nbsp;<A NAME="469"></A>apply
to that part of the soul?&nbsp;<A NAME="470"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="471"></A>
<BR>One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in&nbsp;<A NAME="472"></A>others,
as may happen?&nbsp;<A NAME="473"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="474"></A>
<BR>Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men --lovers&nbsp;<A NAME="475"></A>of
wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?&nbsp;<A NAME="476"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="477"></A>
<BR>And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several&nbsp;<A NAME="478"></A>objects?&nbsp;<A NAME="479"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="480"></A>
<BR>Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn&nbsp;<A NAME="481"></A>which
of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own&nbsp;<A NAME="482"></A>and
depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the vanity&nbsp;<A NAME="483"></A>of
honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages&nbsp;<A NAME="484"></A>of
gold and silver?&nbsp;<A NAME="485"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="486"></A>
<BR>And the lover of honour --what will be his opinion? Will he not think&nbsp;<A NAME="487"></A>that
the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning,&nbsp;<A NAME="488"></A>if
it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to&nbsp;<A NAME="489"></A>him?&nbsp;<A NAME="490"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="491"></A>
<BR>And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value&nbsp;<A NAME="492"></A>on
other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth,&nbsp;<A NAME="493"></A>and
in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the&nbsp;<A NAME="494"></A>heaven
of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under&nbsp;<A NAME="495"></A>the
idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not&nbsp;<A NAME="496"></A>have
them?&nbsp;<A NAME="497"></A>

<P>There can be no doubt of that, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="498"></A>
<BR>Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in&nbsp;<A NAME="499"></A>dispute,
and the question is not which life is more or less honourable,&nbsp;<A NAME="500"></A>or
better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless --how shall&nbsp;<A NAME="501"></A>we
know who speaks truly?&nbsp;<A NAME="502"></A>

<P>I cannot myself tell, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="503"></A>
<BR>Well, but what ought to be the criterion? Is any better than experience&nbsp;<A NAME="504"></A>and
wisdom and reason?&nbsp;<A NAME="505"></A>

<P>There cannot be a better, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="506"></A>
<BR>Then, I said, reflect. Of the three individuals, which has the greatest&nbsp;<A NAME="507"></A>experience
of all the pleasures which we enumerated? Has the lover of gain,&nbsp;<A NAME="508"></A>in
learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of the pleasure&nbsp;<A NAME="509"></A>of
knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of&nbsp;<A NAME="510"></A>gain?&nbsp;<A NAME="511"></A>

<P>The philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he&nbsp;<A NAME="512"></A>has
of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his&nbsp;<A NAME="513"></A>childhood
upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not&nbsp;<A NAME="514"></A>of
necessity tasted --or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could&nbsp;<A NAME="515"></A>hardly
have tasted --the sweetness of learning and knowing&nbsp;<A NAME="516"></A>truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="517"></A>

<P>Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of&nbsp;<A NAME="518"></A>gain,
for he has a double experience?&nbsp;<A NAME="519"></A>

<P>Yes, very great.&nbsp;<A NAME="520"></A>
<BR>Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the&nbsp;<A NAME="521"></A>lover
of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?&nbsp;<A NAME="522"></A>

<P>Nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain&nbsp;<A NAME="523"></A>their
object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike&nbsp;<A NAME="524"></A>have
their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have&nbsp;<A NAME="525"></A>experience
of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be found&nbsp;<A NAME="526"></A>in
the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher&nbsp;<A NAME="527"></A>only.&nbsp;<A NAME="528"></A>

<P>His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any&nbsp;<A NAME="529"></A>one?&nbsp;<A NAME="530"></A>
<BR>Far better.&nbsp;<A NAME="531"></A>
<BR>And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as&nbsp;<A NAME="532"></A>experience?&nbsp;<A NAME="533"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="534"></A>
<BR>Further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not&nbsp;<A NAME="535"></A>possessed
by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the&nbsp;<A NAME="536"></A>philosopher?&nbsp;<A NAME="537"></A>

<P>What faculty?&nbsp;<A NAME="538"></A>
<BR>Reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to&nbsp;<A NAME="539"></A>rest.&nbsp;<A NAME="540"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="541"></A>
<BR>And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?&nbsp;<A NAME="542"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="543"></A>
<BR>If wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of&nbsp;<A NAME="544"></A>the
lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?&nbsp;<A NAME="545"></A>

<P>Assuredly.&nbsp;<A NAME="546"></A>
<BR>Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of the&nbsp;<A NAME="547"></A>ambitious
or pugnacious would be the truest?&nbsp;<A NAME="548"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="549"></A>
<BR>But since experience and wisdom and reason are the&nbsp;<A NAME="550"></A>judges--&nbsp;<A NAME="551"></A>
<BR>The only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are&nbsp;<A NAME="552"></A>approved
by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.&nbsp;<A NAME="553"></A>

<P>And so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent&nbsp;<A NAME="554"></A>part
of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in&nbsp;<A NAME="555"></A>whom
this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest&nbsp;<A NAME="556"></A>life.&nbsp;<A NAME="557"></A>

<P>Unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when&nbsp;<A NAME="558"></A>he
approves of his own life.&nbsp;<A NAME="559"></A>

<P>And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and&nbsp;<A NAME="560"></A>the
pleasure which is next?&nbsp;<A NAME="561"></A>

<P>Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer&nbsp;<A NAME="562"></A>to
himself than the money-maker.&nbsp;<A NAME="563"></A>

<P>Last comes the lover of gain?&nbsp;<A NAME="564"></A>
<BR>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="565"></A>
<BR>Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in&nbsp;<A NAME="566"></A>this
conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to Olympian&nbsp;<A NAME="567"></A>Zeus
the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that&nbsp;<A NAME="568"></A>of
the wise is quite true and pure --all others are a shadow only; and&nbsp;<A NAME="569"></A>surely
this will prove the greatest and most decisive of&nbsp;<A NAME="570"></A>falls?&nbsp;<A NAME="571"></A>

<P>Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?&nbsp;<A NAME="572"></A>
<BR>I will work out the subject and you shall answer my&nbsp;<A NAME="573"></A>questions.&nbsp;<A NAME="574"></A>
<BR>Proceed.&nbsp;<A NAME="575"></A>
<BR>Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?&nbsp;<A NAME="576"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="577"></A>
<BR>And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor&nbsp;<A NAME="578"></A>pain?&nbsp;<A NAME="579"></A>
<BR>There is.&nbsp;<A NAME="580"></A>
<BR>A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about&nbsp;<A NAME="581"></A>either
--that is what you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="582"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="583"></A>
<BR>You remember what people say when they are sick?&nbsp;<A NAME="584"></A>
<BR>What do they say?&nbsp;<A NAME="585"></A>
<BR>That after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they never&nbsp;<A NAME="586"></A>knew
this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were&nbsp;<A NAME="587"></A>ill.&nbsp;<A NAME="588"></A>

<P>Yes, I know, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="589"></A>
<BR>And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must. have heard&nbsp;<A NAME="590"></A>them
say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their&nbsp;<A NAME="591"></A>pain?&nbsp;<A NAME="592"></A>

<P>I have.&nbsp;<A NAME="593"></A>
<BR>And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest&nbsp;<A NAME="594"></A>and
cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them&nbsp;<A NAME="595"></A>as
the greatest pleasure?&nbsp;<A NAME="596"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to&nbsp;<A NAME="597"></A>be
at rest.&nbsp;<A NAME="598"></A>

<P>Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will&nbsp;<A NAME="599"></A>be
painful?&nbsp;<A NAME="600"></A>

<P>Doubtless, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="601"></A>
<BR>Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also&nbsp;<A NAME="602"></A>be
pain?&nbsp;<A NAME="603"></A>

<P>So it would seem.&nbsp;<A NAME="604"></A>
<BR>But can that which is neither become both?&nbsp;<A NAME="605"></A>
<BR>I should say not.&nbsp;<A NAME="606"></A>
<BR>And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they&nbsp;<A NAME="607"></A>not?&nbsp;<A NAME="608"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="609"></A>
<BR>But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,&nbsp;<A NAME="610"></A>and
in a mean between them?&nbsp;<A NAME="611"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="612"></A>
<BR>How, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is&nbsp;<A NAME="613"></A>pleasure,
or that the absence of pleasure is pain?&nbsp;<A NAME="614"></A>

<P>Impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="615"></A>
<BR>This then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is tc say,&nbsp;<A NAME="616"></A>the
rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful,&nbsp;<A NAME="617"></A>and
painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these representations,&nbsp;<A NAME="618"></A>when
tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real but a sort of&nbsp;<A NAME="619"></A>imposition?&nbsp;<A NAME="620"></A>

<P>That is the inference.&nbsp;<A NAME="621"></A>
<BR>Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains&nbsp;<A NAME="622"></A>and
you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that pleasure&nbsp;<A NAME="623"></A>is
only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.&nbsp;<A NAME="624"></A>

<P>What are they, he said, and where shall I find&nbsp;<A NAME="625"></A>them?&nbsp;<A NAME="626"></A>
<BR>There are many of them: take as an example the pleasures, of smell,&nbsp;<A NAME="627"></A>which
are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment,&nbsp;<A NAME="628"></A>and
when they depart leave no pain behind them.&nbsp;<A NAME="629"></A>

<P>Most true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="630"></A>
<BR>Let us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation&nbsp;<A NAME="631"></A>of
pain, or pain of pleasure.&nbsp;<A NAME="632"></A>

<P>No.&nbsp;<A NAME="633"></A>
<BR>Still, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="634"></A>through
the body are generally of this sort --they are reliefs of&nbsp;<A NAME="635"></A>pain.&nbsp;<A NAME="636"></A>

<P>That is true.&nbsp;<A NAME="637"></A>
<BR>And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like&nbsp;<A NAME="638"></A>nature?&nbsp;<A NAME="639"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="640"></A>
<BR>Shall I give you an illustration of them?&nbsp;<A NAME="641"></A>
<BR>Let me hear.&nbsp;<A NAME="642"></A>
<BR>You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower&nbsp;<A NAME="643"></A>and
middle region?&nbsp;<A NAME="644"></A>

<P>I should.&nbsp;<A NAME="645"></A>
<BR>And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would&nbsp;<A NAME="646"></A>he
not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the middle&nbsp;<A NAME="647"></A>and
sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in the upper&nbsp;<A NAME="648"></A>region,
if he has never seen the true upper world?&nbsp;<A NAME="649"></A>

<P>To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?&nbsp;<A NAME="650"></A>
<BR>But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine,&nbsp;<A NAME="651"></A>that
he was descending?&nbsp;<A NAME="652"></A>

<P>No doubt.&nbsp;<A NAME="653"></A>
<BR>All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle&nbsp;<A NAME="654"></A>and
lower regions?&nbsp;<A NAME="655"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="656"></A>
<BR>Then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth,&nbsp;<A NAME="657"></A>as
they have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong&nbsp;<A NAME="658"></A>ideas
about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when&nbsp;<A NAME="659"></A>they
are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think&nbsp;<A NAME="660"></A>the
pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when drawn&nbsp;<A NAME="661"></A>away
from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly believe&nbsp;<A NAME="662"></A>that
they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they, not knowing&nbsp;<A NAME="663"></A>pleasure,
err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain. which is like&nbsp;<A NAME="664"></A>contrasting
black with grey instead of white --can you wonder, I say, at&nbsp;<A NAME="665"></A>this?&nbsp;<A NAME="666"></A>

<P>No, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the&nbsp;<A NAME="667"></A>opposite.&nbsp;<A NAME="668"></A>

<P>Look at the matter thus: --Hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions&nbsp;<A NAME="669"></A>of
the bodily state?&nbsp;<A NAME="670"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="671"></A>
<BR>And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?&nbsp;<A NAME="672"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="673"></A>
<BR>And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of&nbsp;<A NAME="674"></A>either?&nbsp;<A NAME="675"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="676"></A>
<BR>And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that&nbsp;<A NAME="677"></A>which
has more existence the truer?&nbsp;<A NAME="678"></A>

<P>Clearly, from that which has more.&nbsp;<A NAME="679"></A>
<BR>What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your&nbsp;<A NAME="680"></A>judgment
--those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of&nbsp;<A NAME="681"></A>sustenance
are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="682"></A>and
mind and all the different kinds of virtue? Put the question in this&nbsp;<A NAME="683"></A>way:
--Which has a more pure being --that which is concerned with the invariable,&nbsp;<A NAME="684"></A>the
immortal, and the true, and is of such a nature, and is found in such&nbsp;<A NAME="685"></A>natures;
or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and&nbsp;<A NAME="686"></A>mortal,
and is itself variable and mortal?&nbsp;<A NAME="687"></A>

<P>Far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned&nbsp;<A NAME="688"></A>with
the invariable.&nbsp;<A NAME="689"></A>

<P>And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in&nbsp;<A NAME="690"></A>the
same degree as of essence?&nbsp;<A NAME="691"></A>

<P>Yes, of knowledge in the same degree.&nbsp;<A NAME="692"></A>
<BR>And of truth in the same degree?&nbsp;<A NAME="693"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="694"></A>
<BR>And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of&nbsp;<A NAME="695"></A>essence?&nbsp;<A NAME="696"></A>

<P>Necessarily.&nbsp;<A NAME="697"></A>
<BR>Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of&nbsp;<A NAME="698"></A>the
body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service&nbsp;<A NAME="699"></A>of
the soul?&nbsp;<A NAME="700"></A>

<P>Far less.&nbsp;<A NAME="701"></A>
<BR>And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the&nbsp;<A NAME="702"></A>soul?&nbsp;<A NAME="703"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="704"></A>
<BR>What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real&nbsp;<A NAME="705"></A>existence,
is more really filled than that which is filled with less real&nbsp;<A NAME="706"></A>existence
and is less real?&nbsp;<A NAME="707"></A>

<P>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="708"></A>
<BR>And if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according&nbsp;<A NAME="709"></A>to
nature, that which is more really filled with more real being will more&nbsp;<A NAME="710"></A>really
and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which participates in&nbsp;<A NAME="711"></A>less
real being will be less truly and surely satisfied, and will participate&nbsp;<A NAME="712"></A>in
an illusory and less real pleasure?&nbsp;<A NAME="713"></A>

<P>Unquestionably.&nbsp;<A NAME="714"></A>
<BR>Those then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with&nbsp;<A NAME="715"></A>gluttony
and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and in&nbsp;<A NAME="716"></A>this
region they move at random throughout life, but they never pass into&nbsp;<A NAME="717"></A>the
true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever find&nbsp;<A NAME="718"></A>their
way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do they taste&nbsp;<A NAME="719"></A>of
pure and abiding pleasure. Like cattle, with their eyes always looking&nbsp;<A NAME="720"></A>down
and their heads stooping to the earth, that is, to the dining-table,&nbsp;<A NAME="721"></A>they
fatten and feed and breed, and, in their excessive love of these delights,&nbsp;<A NAME="722"></A>they
kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of&nbsp;<A NAME="723"></A>iron;
and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust. For&nbsp;<A NAME="724"></A>they
fill themselves with that which is not substantial, and the part of&nbsp;<A NAME="725"></A>themselves
which they fill is also unsubstantial and&nbsp;<A NAME="726"></A>incontinent.&nbsp;<A NAME="727"></A>

<P>Verily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many&nbsp;<A NAME="728"></A>like
an oracle.&nbsp;<A NAME="729"></A>

<P>Their pleasures are mixed with pains --how can they be otherwise?&nbsp;<A NAME="730"></A>For
they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by&nbsp;<A NAME="731"></A>contrast,
which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant in&nbsp;<A NAME="732"></A>the
minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought about&nbsp;<A NAME="733"></A>as
Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at&nbsp;<A NAME="734"></A>Troy
in ignorance of the truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="735"></A>

<P>Something of that sort must inevitably happen.&nbsp;<A NAME="736"></A>
<BR>And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element&nbsp;<A NAME="737"></A>of
the soul? Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action,&nbsp;<A NAME="738"></A>be
in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or violent and&nbsp;<A NAME="739"></A>contentious,
or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to attain honour&nbsp;<A NAME="740"></A>and
victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or&nbsp;<A NAME="741"></A>sense?&nbsp;<A NAME="742"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element&nbsp;<A NAME="743"></A>also.&nbsp;<A NAME="744"></A>
<BR>Then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,&nbsp;<A NAME="745"></A>when
they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of&nbsp;<A NAME="746"></A>reason
and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="747"></A>shows
them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which&nbsp;<A NAME="748"></A>is
attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and they will have&nbsp;<A NAME="749"></A>the
pleasures which are natural to them, if that which is best for each&nbsp;<A NAME="750"></A>one
is also most natural to him?&nbsp;<A NAME="751"></A>

<P>Yes, certainly; the best is the most natural.&nbsp;<A NAME="752"></A>
<BR>And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there&nbsp;<A NAME="753"></A>is
no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their own&nbsp;<A NAME="754"></A>business,
and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they&nbsp;<A NAME="755"></A>are
capable?&nbsp;<A NAME="756"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="757"></A>
<BR>But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in attaining&nbsp;<A NAME="758"></A>its
own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which&nbsp;<A NAME="759"></A>is
a shadow only and which is not their own?&nbsp;<A NAME="760"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="761"></A>
<BR>And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and&nbsp;<A NAME="762"></A>reason,
the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?&nbsp;<A NAME="763"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="764"></A>
<BR>And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance&nbsp;<A NAME="765"></A>from
law and order?&nbsp;<A NAME="766"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="767"></A>
<BR>And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest&nbsp;<A NAME="768"></A>distance?
Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="769"></A>

<P>And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?&nbsp;<A NAME="770"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="771"></A>
<BR>Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural&nbsp;<A NAME="772"></A>pleasure,
and the king at the least?&nbsp;<A NAME="773"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="774"></A>
<BR>But if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most&nbsp;<A NAME="775"></A>pleasantly?&nbsp;<A NAME="776"></A>

<P>Inevitably.&nbsp;<A NAME="777"></A>
<BR>Would you know the measure of the interval which separates&nbsp;<A NAME="778"></A>them?&nbsp;<A NAME="779"></A>
<BR>Will you tell me?&nbsp;<A NAME="780"></A>
<BR>There appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: now&nbsp;<A NAME="781"></A>the
transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he&nbsp;<A NAME="782"></A>has
run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode&nbsp;<A NAME="783"></A>with
certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure&nbsp;<A NAME="784"></A>of
his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.&nbsp;<A NAME="785"></A>

<P>How do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="786"></A>
<BR>I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch;&nbsp;<A NAME="787"></A>the
democrat was in the middle?&nbsp;<A NAME="788"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="789"></A>
<BR>And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an&nbsp;<A NAME="790"></A>image
of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure&nbsp;<A NAME="791"></A>of
the oligarch?&nbsp;<A NAME="792"></A>

<P>He will.&nbsp;<A NAME="793"></A>
<BR>And the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal&nbsp;<A NAME="794"></A>and
aristocratical?&nbsp;<A NAME="795"></A>

<P>Yes, he is third.&nbsp;<A NAME="796"></A>
<BR>Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number&nbsp;<A NAME="797"></A>which
is three times three?&nbsp;<A NAME="798"></A>

<P>Manifestly.&nbsp;<A NAME="799"></A>
<BR>The shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of&nbsp;<A NAME="800"></A>length
will be a plane figure.&nbsp;<A NAME="801"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="802"></A>
<BR>And if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no&nbsp;<A NAME="803"></A>difficulty
in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted&nbsp;<A NAME="804"></A>from
the king.&nbsp;<A NAME="805"></A>

<P>Yes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.&nbsp;<A NAME="806"></A>
<BR>Or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval&nbsp;<A NAME="807"></A>by
which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he will&nbsp;<A NAME="808"></A>find
him, when the multiplication is complete, living 729 times more pleasantly,&nbsp;<A NAME="809"></A>and
the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.&nbsp;<A NAME="810"></A>

<P>What a wonderful calculation! And how enormous is the distance&nbsp;<A NAME="811"></A>which
separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and&nbsp;<A NAME="812"></A>pain!&nbsp;<A NAME="813"></A>

<P>Yet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns&nbsp;<A NAME="814"></A>human
life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months&nbsp;<A NAME="815"></A>and
years.&nbsp;<A NAME="816"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with&nbsp;<A NAME="817"></A>them.&nbsp;<A NAME="818"></A>
<BR>Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil&nbsp;<A NAME="819"></A>and
unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of&nbsp;<A NAME="820"></A>life
and in beauty and virtue?&nbsp;<A NAME="821"></A>

<P>Immeasurably greater.&nbsp;<A NAME="822"></A>
<BR>Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument,&nbsp;<A NAME="823"></A>we
may revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one saying&nbsp;<A NAME="824"></A>that
injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be&nbsp;<A NAME="825"></A>just?&nbsp;<A NAME="826"></A>

<P>Yes, that was said.&nbsp;<A NAME="827"></A>
<BR>Now then, having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice,&nbsp;<A NAME="828"></A>let
us have a little conversation with him.&nbsp;<A NAME="829"></A>

<P>What shall we say to him?&nbsp;<A NAME="830"></A>
<BR>Let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words presented&nbsp;<A NAME="831"></A>before
his eyes.&nbsp;<A NAME="832"></A>

<P>Of what sort?&nbsp;<A NAME="833"></A>
<BR>An ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient&nbsp;<A NAME="834"></A>mythology,
such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are many&nbsp;<A NAME="835"></A>others
in which two or more different natures are said to grow into&nbsp;<A NAME="836"></A>one.&nbsp;<A NAME="837"></A>

<P>There are said of have been such unions.&nbsp;<A NAME="838"></A>
<BR>Then do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,&nbsp;<A NAME="839"></A>having
a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he&nbsp;<A NAME="840"></A>is
able to generate and metamorphose at will.&nbsp;<A NAME="841"></A>

<P>You suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is&nbsp;<A NAME="842"></A>more
pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model&nbsp;<A NAME="843"></A>as
you propose.&nbsp;<A NAME="844"></A>

<P>Suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third&nbsp;<A NAME="845"></A>of
a man, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than&nbsp;<A NAME="846"></A>the
second.&nbsp;<A NAME="847"></A>

<P>That, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you&nbsp;<A NAME="848"></A>say.&nbsp;<A NAME="849"></A>
<BR>And now join them, and let the three grow into one.&nbsp;<A NAME="850"></A>
<BR>That has been accomplished.&nbsp;<A NAME="851"></A>
<BR>Next fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man,&nbsp;<A NAME="852"></A>so
that he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer hull,&nbsp;<A NAME="853"></A>may
believe the beast to be a single human creature. I have done so, he&nbsp;<A NAME="854"></A>said.&nbsp;<A NAME="855"></A>

<P>And now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human&nbsp;<A NAME="856"></A>creature
to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that,&nbsp;<A NAME="857"></A>if
he be right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous&nbsp;<A NAME="858"></A>monster
and strengthen the lion and the lion-like qualities, but to starve&nbsp;<A NAME="859"></A>and
weaken the man, who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the&nbsp;<A NAME="860"></A>mercy
of either of the other two; and he is not to attempt to familiarize&nbsp;<A NAME="861"></A>or
harmonize them with one another --he ought rather to suffer them to&nbsp;<A NAME="862"></A>fight
and bite and devour one another.&nbsp;<A NAME="863"></A>

<P>Certainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="864"></A>says.&nbsp;<A NAME="865"></A>
<BR>To him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so&nbsp;<A NAME="866"></A>speak
and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most&nbsp;<A NAME="867"></A>complete
mastery over the entire human creature.&nbsp;<A NAME="868"></A>

<P>He should watch over the many-headed monster like a good husbandman,&nbsp;<A NAME="869"></A>fostering
and cultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the wild&nbsp;<A NAME="870"></A>ones
from growing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally, and in&nbsp;<A NAME="871"></A>common
care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another&nbsp;<A NAME="872"></A>and
with himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="873"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice&nbsp;<A NAME="874"></A>say.&nbsp;<A NAME="875"></A>
<BR>And so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or advantage,&nbsp;<A NAME="876"></A>the
approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and the disapprover&nbsp;<A NAME="877"></A>is
wrong and false and ignorant.&nbsp;<A NAME="878"></A>

<P>Yes, from every point of view.&nbsp;<A NAME="879"></A>
<BR>Come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally&nbsp;<A NAME="880"></A>in
error. 'Sweet Sir,' we will say to him, what think you of things esteemed&nbsp;<A NAME="881"></A>noble
and ignoble? Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the&nbsp;<A NAME="882"></A>man,
or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which subjects the&nbsp;<A NAME="883"></A>man
to the beast?' He can hardly avoid saying yes --can he&nbsp;<A NAME="884"></A>now?&nbsp;<A NAME="885"></A>

<P>Not if he has any regard for my opinion.&nbsp;<A NAME="886"></A>
<BR>But, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question:&nbsp;<A NAME="887"></A>'Then
how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition&nbsp;<A NAME="888"></A>that
he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst? Who can imagine&nbsp;<A NAME="889"></A>that
a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money, especially&nbsp;<A NAME="890"></A>if
he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be the gainer,&nbsp;<A NAME="891"></A>however
large might be the sum which he received? And will any one say&nbsp;<A NAME="892"></A>that
he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine&nbsp;<A NAME="893"></A>being
to that which is most godless and detestable? Eriphyle took the necklace&nbsp;<A NAME="894"></A>as
the price of her husband's life, but he is taking a bribe in order to&nbsp;<A NAME="895"></A>compass
a worse ruin.'&nbsp;<A NAME="896"></A>

<P>Yes, said Glaucon, far worse --I will answer for&nbsp;<A NAME="897"></A>him.&nbsp;<A NAME="898"></A>
<BR>Has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge&nbsp;<A NAME="899"></A>multiform
monster is allowed to be too much at large?&nbsp;<A NAME="900"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="901"></A>
<BR>And men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent&nbsp;<A NAME="902"></A>element
in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?&nbsp;<A NAME="903"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="904"></A>
<BR>And luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this&nbsp;<A NAME="905"></A>same
creature, and make a coward of him?&nbsp;<A NAME="906"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="907"></A>
<BR>And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates&nbsp;<A NAME="908"></A>the
spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money,&nbsp;<A NAME="909"></A>of
which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his youth&nbsp;<A NAME="910"></A>to
be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a&nbsp;<A NAME="911"></A>monkey?&nbsp;<A NAME="912"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="913"></A>
<BR>And why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach Only because&nbsp;<A NAME="914"></A>they
imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual is&nbsp;<A NAME="915"></A>unable
to control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and&nbsp;<A NAME="916"></A>his
great study is how to flatter them.&nbsp;<A NAME="917"></A>

<P>Such appears to be the reason.&nbsp;<A NAME="918"></A>
<BR>And therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that&nbsp;<A NAME="919"></A>of
the best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in whom&nbsp;<A NAME="920"></A>the
Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the servant,&nbsp;<A NAME="921"></A>but
because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within&nbsp;<A NAME="922"></A>him;
or, if this be impossible, then by an external authority, in order&nbsp;<A NAME="923"></A>that
we may be all, as far as possible, under the same government, friends&nbsp;<A NAME="924"></A>and
equals.&nbsp;<A NAME="925"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="926"></A>
<BR>And this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is the&nbsp;<A NAME="927"></A>ally
of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we exercise&nbsp;<A NAME="928"></A>over
children, and the refusal to let them be free until we have established&nbsp;<A NAME="929"></A>in
them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state, and by cultivation&nbsp;<A NAME="930"></A>of
this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler&nbsp;<A NAME="931"></A>like
our own, and when this is done they may go their&nbsp;<A NAME="932"></A>ways.&nbsp;<A NAME="933"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.&nbsp;<A NAME="934"></A>
<BR>From what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a&nbsp;<A NAME="935"></A>man
is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will&nbsp;<A NAME="936"></A>make
him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his&nbsp;<A NAME="937"></A>wickedness?&nbsp;<A NAME="938"></A>

<P>From no point of view at all.&nbsp;<A NAME="939"></A>
<BR>What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?&nbsp;<A NAME="940"></A>He
who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and punished&nbsp;<A NAME="941"></A>has
the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the gentler element&nbsp;<A NAME="942"></A>in
him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the&nbsp;<A NAME="943"></A>acquirement
of justice and temperance and wisdom, more than the body ever&nbsp;<A NAME="944"></A>is
by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and health, in proportion as&nbsp;<A NAME="945"></A>the
soul is more honourable than the body.&nbsp;<A NAME="946"></A>

<P>Certainly, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="947"></A>
<BR>To this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies&nbsp;<A NAME="948"></A>of
his life. And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress&nbsp;<A NAME="949"></A>these
qualities on his soul and disregard others?&nbsp;<A NAME="950"></A>

<P>Clearly, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="951"></A>
<BR>In the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training,&nbsp;<A NAME="952"></A>and
so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures,&nbsp;<A NAME="953"></A>that
he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first&nbsp;<A NAME="954"></A>object
will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is&nbsp;<A NAME="955"></A>likely
thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to attemper&nbsp;<A NAME="956"></A>the
body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?&nbsp;<A NAME="957"></A>

<P>Certainly he will, if he has true music in him.&nbsp;<A NAME="958"></A>
<BR>And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and&nbsp;<A NAME="959"></A>harmony
which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled&nbsp;<A NAME="960"></A>by
the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite&nbsp;<A NAME="961"></A>harm?&nbsp;<A NAME="962"></A>

<P>Certainly not, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="963"></A>
<BR>He will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no&nbsp;<A NAME="964"></A>disorder
occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or from&nbsp;<A NAME="965"></A>want;
and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or&nbsp;<A NAME="966"></A>spend
according to his means.&nbsp;<A NAME="967"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="968"></A>
<BR>And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours&nbsp;<A NAME="969"></A>as
he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private&nbsp;<A NAME="970"></A>or
public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will&nbsp;<A NAME="971"></A>avoid?&nbsp;<A NAME="972"></A>

<P>Then, if that is his motive, he will not be a&nbsp;<A NAME="973"></A>statesman.&nbsp;<A NAME="974"></A>
<BR>By the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which 's his own he certainly&nbsp;<A NAME="975"></A>will,
though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a divine&nbsp;<A NAME="976"></A>call.&nbsp;<A NAME="977"></A>

<P>I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which&nbsp;<A NAME="978"></A>we
are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe&nbsp;<A NAME="979"></A>that
there is such an one anywhere on earth?&nbsp;<A NAME="980"></A>

<P>In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks,&nbsp;<A NAME="981"></A>which
he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in&nbsp;<A NAME="982"></A>order.
But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no&nbsp;<A NAME="983"></A>matter;
for he will live after the manner of that city, having nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="984"></A>to
do with any other.&nbsp;<A NAME="985"></A>

<P>I think so, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="end"></A>
