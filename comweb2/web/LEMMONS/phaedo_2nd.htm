<p><br>And now let us proceed, he said. And first of all let me be sure
that I have in my mind what you were saying.<b> Simmias</b>, if I remember
rightly, has fears and misgivings whether the soul, being in the form of
harmony, although a fairer and diviner thing than the body, may not perish
first. On the other hand, <b>Cebes</b> appeared to grant that the soul
was more lasting than the body, but he said that no one could know whether
the soul, after having worn out many bodies, might not perish herself and
leave her last body behind her; and that this is death, which is the destruction
not of the body but of the soul, for in the body the work of destruction
is ever going on. Are not these, Simmias and Cebes, the points which we
have to consider?
<p>They both agreed to this statement of them. He proceeded: And did you
deny the force of the whole preceding argument, or of a part only?
<p>Of a part only, they replied. And what did you think, he said, of that
part of the argument in which we said that knowledge was recollection only,
and inferred from this that the soul must have previously existed somewhere
else before she was enclosed in the body? Cebes said that he had been wonderfully
impressed by that part of the argument, and that his conviction remained
unshaken. Simmias agreed, and added that he himself could hardly imagine
the possibility of his ever thinking differently about that.
<p>But, rejoined Socrates, you will have to think differently, my Theban
friend, if you still maintain that harmony is a compound, and that the
soul is a harmony which is made out of strings set in the frame of the
body; for you will surely never allow yourself to say that a harmony is
prior to the elements which compose the harmony.
<p>No, Socrates, that is impossible. But do you not see that you are saying
this when you say that the soul existed before she took the form and body
of man, and was made up of elements which as yet had no existence? For
harmony is not a sort of thing like the soul, as you suppose; but first
the lyre, and the strings, and the sounds exist in a state of discord,
and then harmony is made last of all, and perishes first. And how can such
a notion of the soul as this agree with the other?
<p>[19]
<p>Not at all, replied Simmias. And yet, he said, there surely ought to
be harmony when harmony is the theme of discourse.
<p>There ought, replied Simmias. But there is no harmony, he said, in the
two propositions that knowledge is recollection, and that the soul is a
harmony. Which of them, then, will you retain?
<p>I think, he replied, that I have a much stronger faith, Socrates, in
the first of the two, which has been fully demonstrated to me, than in
the latter, which has not been demonstrated at all, but rests only on probable
and plausible grounds; and I know too well that these arguments from probabilities
are impostors, and unless great caution is observed in the use of them
they are apt to be deceptive-in geometry, and in other things too. <b>But
the doctrine of knowledge and recollection has been proven to me on trustworthy
grounds; and the proof was that the soul must have existed before she came
into the body, because to her belongs the essence of which the very name
implies existence. Having, as I am convinced, rightly accepted this conclusion,
and on sufficient grounds, I must, as I suppose, cease to argue or allow
others to argue that the soul is a harmony.</b>
<p><b>Let me give Simmias another argument:&nbsp;</b> <i>Do you imagine
that a harmony or any other composition can be in a state other than that
of the elements out of which it is compounded?</i>
<p>Certainly not. Or do or suffer anything other than they do or suffer?
Simmias agreed. Then a harmony does not lead the parts or elements which
make up the harmony, but only follows them.
<p>He assented.<i> For harmony cannot possibly have any motion, or sound,
or other quality which is opposed to the parts.</i>
<p>That would be impossible, he replied. And does not every harmony depend
upon the manner in which the elements are harmonized?
<p>I do not understand you, he said. I mean to say that a <i>harmony admits
of degrees,</i> and is more of a harmony, and more completely a harmony,
when more completely harmonized, if that be possible; and less of a harmony,
and less completely a harmony, when less harmonized.
<p>True. <i>But does the soul admit of degrees?</i> or is one soul in the
very least degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than
another?<i></i>
<p><i>Not in the least: souls do not admit of degrees [all souls are equally
souls)</i>. [If so, then soul cannot be a harmony].<b></b>
<p><b>[Here is another argument that the soul cannot be a harmony.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul cannot be a harmony; because if the
soul is a harmony, then no soul can be vicious, since virtue is harmony
and vice is discord.]</b><b></b>
<p><b>Or speaking more correctly, Simmias, the soul, if she is a harmony,
will never have any vice; because a harmony, being absolutely a harmony,
has no part in the inharmonical?</b>
<p>No. And therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has no vice? How
can she have, consistently with the preceding argument? Then, according
to this, if the souls of all animals are equally and absolutely souls,
they will be equally good?
<p>Yes, he said. And can all this be true, think you? Socrates said; and
are all these consequences admissible-which nevertheless seem to follow
from the assumption that the soul is a harmony?
<p>Certainly not: vicious exists. [Thus the soul cannot be a harmony].<b></b>
<p><b>[Here's another argument against the soul being a harmony.]</b>
<p>Once more, he said, what ruling principle is there of human things other
than the soul, and especially the wise soul? Do you know of any?
<p>Indeed, I do not. <i>And is the soul in agreement with the affections
of the body?</i> or is she at variance with them? For example, when the
body is hot and thirsty, does not the soul incline us against drinking?
and when the body is hungry, against eating? And this is only one instance
out of ten thousand of the opposition of the soul to the things of the
body.
<p>Very true. But we have already acknowledged that <i>[if the soul is
a harmony, then it can never utter a note at variance with the tensions
and relaxations and vibrations and other affections of the strings out
of which she is composed; she can only follow, she cannot lead them.]&nbsp;
. . .But&nbsp; do we not discover the soul to be doing the exact opposite-leading
the elements of which she is believed to be composed; almost always opposing
and coercing them in all sorts of ways throughout life, sometimes more
violently with the pains of medicine and gymnastic; then again more gently;
threatening and also reprimanding the desires, passions, fears, as if talking
to a thing which is not herself,</i> as Homer in the "Odyssey" represents
Odysseus doing in the words, "He beat his breast, and thus reproached his
heart: Endure, my heart; far worse hast thou endured!" Do you think that
Homer could have written this under the idea that the soul is a harmony
capable of being led by the affections of the body, and not rather of a
nature which leads and masters them; and herself a far diviner thing than
any harmony?
<p>Yes, Socrates, I quite agree to that. Then, my friend,<b> we can never
be right in saying that the soul is a harmony, for that would clearly contradict
the divine Homer as well as ourselves.</b>
<p>True, he said. Thus much, said Socrates, of Harmonia, your Theban goddess,
Cebes, who has not been ungracious to us, I think; but what shall I say
to the Theban Cadmus, and how shall I propitiate him?
<p>I think that you will discover a way of propitiating him, said Cebes;
I am sure that you have answered the argument about harmony in a manner
that I could never have expected. For when Simmias mentioned his objection,
I quite imagined that no answer could be given to him, and therefore I
was surprised at finding that his argument could not sustain the first
onset of yours; and not impossibly the other, whom you call Cadmus, may
share a similar fate.
<p>Nay, my good friend, said Socrates, let us not boast, lest some evil
eye should put to flight the word which I am about to speak. That, however,
may be left in the hands of those above, while I draw near in Homeric fashion,
and try the mettle of your words. Briefly, <b>the sum of your objection
is as follows: You want to have proven to you that the soul is imperishable
and immortal, and you think that the philosopher who is confident in death
has but a vain and foolish confidence, if he thinks that he will fare better
than one who has led another sort of life, in the world below, unless he
can prove this; and you say that the demonstration of the strength and
divinity of the soul, and of her existence prior to our becoming men, does
not necessarily imply her immortality. Granting that the soul is longlived,
and has known and done much in a former state, still she is not on that
account immortal; and her entrance into the human form may be a sort of
disease which is the beginning of dissolution, and may at last, after the
toils of life are over, end in that which is called death. And whether
the soul enters into the body once only or many times, that, as you would
say, makes no difference in the fears of individuals. For any man, who
is not devoid of natural feeling, has reason to fear, if he has no knowledge
or proof of the soul's immortality.</b> That is what I suppose you to say,
Cebes, which I designedly repeat, in order that nothing may escape us,
and that you may, if you wish, add or subtract anything.
<p>[21] But, said Cebes, as far as I can see at present, I have nothing
to add or subtract; you have expressed my meaning.
<p>Socrates paused awhile, and seemed to be absorbed in reflection. At
length he said: This is a very serious inquiry which you are raising, Cebes,
involving the whole question of generation and corruption, about which
I will, if you like, give you my own experience; and you can apply this,
if you think that anything which I say will avail towards the solution
of your difficulty.
<p>I should very much like, said Cebes, to hear what you have to say. Then
I will tell you, said Socrates. <b>When I was young, Cebes, </b>I had a
prodigious desire to know that department of philosophy which is called
Natural Science; this appeared to me to have lofty aims, as being the science
which has to do with the causes of things, and which teaches why a thing
is, and is created and destroyed; and I was always agitating myself with
the consideration of such questions as these: Is the growth of animals
the result of some decay which the hot and cold principle contracts, as
some have said? Is the blood the element with which we think, or the air,
or the fire? or perhaps nothing of this sort-but the brain may be the originating
power of the perceptions of hearing and sight and smell, and memory and
opinion may come from them, and science may be based on memory and opinion
when no longer in motion, but at rest. And then I went on to examine the
decay of them, and then to the things of heaven and earth, and at last
I concluded that I was wholly incapable of these inquiries,&nbsp; . . .
Then I heard someone who had a book of Anaxagoras, as he said, out of which
he read that mind was the disposer and cause of all, and I was quite delighted
at the notion of this, which appeared admirable, and I said to myself:
If mind is the disposer, mind will dispose all for the best, and put each
particular in the best place; and I argued that if anyone desired to find
out the cause of the generation or destruction or existence of anything,
he must find out what state of being or suffering or doing was best for
that thing, and therefore a man had only to consider the best for himself
and others, and then he would also know the worse, for that the same science
comprised both. And I rejoiced to think that I had found in Anaxagoras
a teacher of the causes of existence such as I desired, and I imagined
that he would tell me first whether the earth is flat or round; and then
he would further explain the cause and the necessity of this, and would
teach me the nature of the best and show that this was best; and if he
said that the earth was in the centre, he would explain that this position
was the best, and I should be satisfied if this were shown to me, and not
want any other sort of cause. And I thought that I would then go and ask
him about the sun and moon and stars, and that he would explain to me their
comparative swiftness, and their returnings and various states, and how
their several affections, active and passive, were all for the best. For
I could not imagine that when he spoke of mind as the disposer of them,
he would give any other account of their being as they are, except that
this was best; and I thought when he had explained to me in detail the
cause of each and the cause of all, he would go on to explain to me what
was best for each and what was best for all. I had hopes which I would
not have sold for much, and I seized the books and read them as fast as
I could in my eagerness to know the better and the worse.
<p>[22] What hopes I had formed, and how grievously was I disappointed!
As I proceeded, I found my philosopher altogether forsaking mind or any
other principle of order, but having recourse to air, and ether, and water,
and other eccentricities. I might compare him to a person who began by
maintaining generally that mind is the cause of the actions of Socrates,
but who, when he endeavored to explain the causes of my several actions
in detail, went on to show that I sit here because my body is made up of
bones and muscles; and the bones, as he would say, are hard and have ligaments
which divide them, and the muscles are elastic, and they cover the bones,
which have also a covering or environment of flesh and skin which contains
them; and as the bones are lifted at their joints by the contraction or
relaxation of the muscles, I am able to bend my limbs, and this is why
I am sitting here in a curved posture: that is what he would say, and he
would have a similar explanation of my talking to you, which he would attribute
to sound, and air, and hearing, and he would assign ten thousand other
causes of the same sort, forgetting to mention the true cause, which is
that the Athenians have thought fit to condemn me, and accordingly I have
thought it better and more right to remain here and undergo my sentence;
<i>for I am inclined to think that these muscles and bones of mine would
have gone off to Megara or Boeotia-by the dog of Egypt they would, if they
had been guided only by their own idea of what was best, and if I had not
chosen as the better and nobler part, instead of playing truant and running
away, to undergo any punishment which the State inflicts.</i> There is
surely a strange confusion of causes and conditions in all this. It may
be said, indeed, that without bones and muscles and the other parts of
the body I cannot execute my purposes. <b>But to say that I do as I do
because of them, and that this is the way in which mind acts, and not from
the choice of the best, is a very careless and idle mode of speaking. I
wonder that they cannot distinguish the cause from the condition, </b>which
the many, feeling about in the dark, are always mistaking and misnaming.
. . . There is nothing new, he said, in what I am about to tell you; but
only what I have been always and everywhere repeating in the previous discussion
and on other occasions: I want to show you the nature of that cause which
has occupied my thoughts, and I shall have to go back to those familiar
words which are in the mouth of everyone, and<b> first of all assume that
there is an absolute beauty and goodness and greatness, and the like; grant
me this, and I hope to be able to show you the nature of the cause, and
to prove the immortality of the soul.</b>
<p>Cebes said: You may proceed at once with the proof, as I readily grant
you this.
<p>[23] Well, he said, then I should like to know whether you agree with
me in the next step; for I cannot help thinking that if there be anything
beautiful other than absolute beauty, that can only be beautiful in as
far as it partakes of absolute beauty-and this I should say of everything.
Do you agree in this notion of the cause?
<p>Yes, he said, I agree. He proceeded: I know nothing and can understand
nothing of any other of those wise causes which are alleged; and if a person
says to me that the bloom of color, or form, or anything else of that sort
is a source of beauty, I leave all that, which is only confusing to me,
and simply and singly, and perhaps foolishly, hold and am assured in my
own mind that nothing makes a thing beautiful but the presence and participation
of beauty in whatever way or manner obtained; for as to the manner I am
uncertain, but I stoutly contend that <i>by beauty all beautiful things
become beautiful. </i>That appears to me to be the only safe answer that
I can give, either to myself or to any other, and to that I cling, in the
persuasion that I shall never be overthrown, and that I may safely answer
to myself or any other that by beauty beautiful things become beautiful.
Do you not agree to that?
<p>Yes, I agree. And that by greatness only great things become great and
greater greater, and by smallness the less becomes less.
<p>True. . . .And you would loudly asseverate that you know of no way in
which anything comes into existence except by participation in its own
proper essence, and consequently, as far as you know, the only cause of
two is the participation in duality; that is the way to make two, and the
participation in one is the way to make one. You would say: I will let
alone puzzles of division and addition-wiser heads than mine may answer
them; inexperienced as I am, and ready to start, as the proverb says, at
my own shadow, I cannot afford to give up the sure ground of a principle.
And if anyone assails you there, you would not mind him, or answer him
until you had seen whether the consequences which follow agree with one
another or not, and when you are further required to give an explanation
of this principle, you would go on to assume a higher principle, and the
best of the higher ones, until you found a resting-place; but you would
not refuse the principle and the consequences in your reasoning like the
Eristics-at least if you wanted to discover real existence. Not that this
confusion signifies to them who never care or think about the matter at
all, for they have the wit to be well pleased with themselves, however
great may be the turmoil of their ideas. But you, if you are a philosopher,
will, I believe, do as I say.
<p>What you say is most true, said Simmias and Cebes, both speaking at
once.
<p>Ech. Yes, Phaedo; and I don't wonder at their assenting. Anyone who
has the least sense will acknowledge the wonderful clear. of Socrates'
reasoning.
<p>Phaed. Certainly, Echecrates; and that was the feeling of the whole
company at the time.
<p>Ech. Yes, and equally of ourselves, who were not of the company, and
are now listening to your recital. But what followed?
<p>[24] Phaedo. After all this was admitted, and they had agreed about
the existence of ideas and the participation in them of the other things
which derive their names from them, Socrates, if I remember rightly, said:-
<p>This is your way of speaking; and yet when you say that Simmias is greater
than Socrates and less than Phaedo, do you not predicate of Simmias both
greatness and smallness?
<p>Yes, I do. But still you allow that Simmias does not really exceed Socrates,
as the words may seem to imply, because he is Simmias, but by reason of
the size which he has; just as Simmias does not exceed Socrates because
he is Simmias, any more than because Socrates is Socrates, but because
he has smallness when compared with the greatness of Simmias?
<p>True. And if Phaedo exceeds him in size, that is not because Phaedo
is Phaedo, but because Phaedo has greatness relatively to Simmias, who
is comparatively smaller?
<p>That is true. And therefore Simmias is said to be great, and is also
said to be small, because he is in a mean between them, exceeding the smallness
of the one by his greatness, and allowing the greatness of the other to
exceed his smallness. He added, laughing, I am speaking like a book, but
I believe that what I am now saying is true.
<p>Simmias assented to this. The reason why I say this is that I want you
to agree with me in thinking, not only that absolute greatness will never
be great and also small, but that greatness in us or in the concrete will
never admit the small or admit of being exceeded: instead of this, one
of two things will happen-either the greater will fly or retire before
the opposite, which is the less, or at the advance of the less will cease
to exist; but will not, if allowing or admitting smallness, be changed
by that; even as I, having received and admitted smallness when compared
with Simmias, remain just as I was, and am the same small person. And as
the idea of greatness cannot condescend ever to be or become small, in
like manner the smallness in us cannot be or become great; nor can any
other opposite which remains the same ever be or become its own opposite,
but either passes away or perishes in the change.
<p>That, replied Cebes, is quite my notion. One of the company, though
I do not exactly remember which of them, on hearing this, said: By Heaven,
is not this the direct contrary of what was admitted before-that out of
the greater came the less and out of the less the greater, and that opposites
are simply generated from opposites; whereas now this seems to be utterly
denied.
<p>Socrates inclined his head to the speaker and listened. I like your
courage, he said, in reminding us of this. But you do not observe that
there is a difference in the two cases. For then we were speaking of opposites
in the concrete, and now of the essential opposite which, as is affirmed,
neither in us nor in nature can ever be at variance with itself: then,
my friend, we were speaking of things in which opposites are inherent and
which are called after them, but now about the opposites which are inherent
in them and which give their name to them; these essential opposites will
never, as we maintain, admit of generation into or out of one another.
At the same time, turning to Cebes, he said: Were you at all disconcerted,
Cebes, at our friend's objection?
<p>That was not my feeling, said Cebes; and yet I cannot deny that I am
apt to be disconcerted.
<p>Then we are agreed after all, said Socrates, that the opposite will
never in any case be opposed to itself?
<p>To that we are quite agreed, he replied. Yet once more let me ask you
to consider the question from another point of view, and see whether you
agree with me: There is a thing which you term heat, and another thing
which you term cold?
<p>Certainly. But are they the same as fire and snow? Most assuredly not.
Heat is not the same as fire, nor is cold the same as snow? No. And yet
you will surely admit that when snow, as before said, is under the influence
of heat, they will not remain snow and heat; but at the advance of the
heat the snow will either retire or perish?
<p>Very true, he replied. And the fire too at the advance of the cold will
either retire or perish; and when the fire is under the influence of the
cold, they will not remain, as before, fire and cold.
<p>[25]
<p>That is true, he said. And in some cases the name of the idea is not
confined to the idea; but anything else which, not being the idea, exists
only in the form of the idea, may also lay claim to it. I will try to make
this clearer by an example: The odd number is always called by the name
of odd?
<p>Very true. But is this the only thing which is called odd? Are there
not other things which have their own name, and yet are called odd, because,
although not the same as oddness, they are never without oddness?-that
is what I mean to ask-whether numbers such as the number three are not
of the class of odd. And there are many other examples: would you not say,
for example, that three may be called by its proper name, and also be called
odd, which is not the same with three? and this may be said not only of
three but also of five, and every alternate number-each of them without
being oddness is odd, and in the same way two and four, and the whole series
of alternate numbers, has every number even, without being evenness. Do
you admit that?
<p>Yes, he said, how can I deny that? Then now mark the point at which
I am aiming: not only do essential opposites exclude one another, but also
concrete things, which, although not in themselves opposed, contain opposites;
these, I say, also reject the idea which is opposed to that which is contained
in them, and at the advance of that they either perish or withdraw. There
is the number three for example; will not that endure annihilation or anything
sooner than be converted into an even number, remaining three?
<p>Very true, said Cebes. And yet, he said, the number two is certainly
not opposed to the number three?
<p>It is not. Then not only do opposite ideas repel the advance of one
another, but also there are other things which repel the approach of opposites.
<p>That is quite true, he said. Suppose, he said, that we endeavor, if
possible, to determine what these are.
<p>By all means. Are they not, Cebes, such as compel the things of which
they have possession, not only to take their own form, but also the form
of some opposite?
<p>What do you mean? I mean, as I was just now saying, and have no need
to repeat to you, that those things which are possessed by the number three
must not only be three in number, but must also be odd.
<p>Quite true. And on this oddness, of which the number three has the impress,
the opposite idea will never intrude?
<p>No. And this impress was given by the odd principle? Yes. And to the
odd is opposed the even? True. Then the idea of the even number will never
arrive at three? No. Then three has no part in the even? None. Then the
triad or number three is uneven? Very true. To return then to my distinction
of natures which are not opposites, and yet do not admit opposites: as,
in this instance, three, although not opposed to the even, does not any
the more admit of the even, but always brings the opposite into play on
the other side; or as two does not receive the odd, or fire the cold-from
these examples (and there are many more of them) perhaps you may be able
to arrive at the general conclusion that not only opposites will not receive
opposites, but also that nothing which brings the opposite will admit the
opposite of that which it brings in that to which it is brought. And here
let me recapitulate-for there is no harm in repetition. The number five
will not admit the nature of the even, any more than ten, which is the
double of five, will admit the nature of the odd-the double, though not
strictly opposed to the odd, rejects the odd altogether. Nor again will
parts in the ratio of 3:2, nor any fraction in which there is a half, nor
again in which there is a third, admit the notion of the whole, although
they are not opposed to the whole. You will agree to that?
<p>Yes, he said, I entirely agree and go along with you in that. And now,
he said, I think that I may begin again; and to the question which I am
about to ask I will beg you to give not the old safe answer, but another,
of which I will offer you an example; and I hope that you will find in
what has been just said another foundation which is as safe. I mean that
if anyone asks you "what that is, the inherence of which makes the body
hot," you will reply not heat (this is what I call the safe and stupid
answer), but fire, a far better answer, which we are now in a condition
to give. Or if anyone asks you "why a body is diseased," you will not say
from disease, but from fever; and instead of saying that oddness is the
cause of odd numbers, you will say that the monad is the cause of them:
and so of things in general, as I dare say that you will understand sufficiently
without my adducing any further examples.
<p>[26]
<p>Yes, he said, I quite understand you. <b>Tell me, then, what is that
the inherence of which will render the body alive?</b><b></b>
<p><b>The soul, he replied. And is this always the case? Yes, he said,
of course. Then whatever the soul possesses, to that she comes bearing
life? Yes, certainly. And is there any opposite to life? There is, he said.
And what is that? Death. Then the soul, as has been acknowledged, will
never receive the opposite of what she brings.</b> . . .And what do we
call the principle which does not admit of death? The immortal, he said.
And does the soul admit of death? No. Then the soul is immortal? Yes, he
said. And may we say that this is proven? Yes, abundantly proven, Socrates,
he replied.
<p>And supposing that the odd were imperishable, must not three be imperishable?
<p>Of course. And if that which is cold were imperishable, when the warm
principle came attacking the snow, must not the snow have retired whole
and unmelted-for it could never have perished, nor could it have remained
and admitted the heat?
<p>True, he said. Again, if the uncooling or warm principle were imperishable,
the fire when assailed by cold would not have perished or have been extinguished,
but would have gone away unaffected?
<p>Certainly, he said. And the same may be said of the immortal:<b> if
the immortal is also imperishable, the soul when attacked by death cannot
perish; </b>for the preceding argument shows that the soul will not admit
of death, or ever be dead, any more than three or the odd number will admit
of the even, or fire or the heat in the fire, of the cold. Yet a person
may say: "But although the odd will not become even at the approach of
the even, why may not the odd perish and the even take the place of the
odd?" Now to him who makes this objection, we cannot answer that the odd
principle is imperishable; for this has not been acknowledged, but if this
had been acknowledged, there would have been no difficulty in contending
that at the approach of the even the odd principle and the number three
took up their departure; and the same argument would have held good of
fire and heat and any other thing.
<p>Very true. And the same may be said of the immortal: i<b>f the immortal
is also imperishable, then the soul will be imperishable as well as immortal;</b>
but if not, some other proof of her imperishableness will have to be given.
<p>No other proof is needed, he said; for if the immortal, being eternal,
is liable to perish, then nothing is imperishable.
<p>Yes, replied Socrates, all men will agree that God, and the essential
form of life, and the immortal in general, will never perish.
<p>Yes, all men, he said-that is true; and what is more, gods, if I am
not mistaken, as well as men.
<p>Seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must not the soul,
if she is immortal, be also imperishable?
<p>Most certainly. Then when death attacks a man, the mortal portion of
him may be supposed to die, but the immortal goes out of the way of death
and is preserved safe and sound?
<p>True. <b>Then, Cebes, beyond question the soul is immortal and imperishable,
and our souls will truly exist in another world!</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>. . .
<p>That, he said, is true. But then, <i>O my friends, he said, if the soul
is really immortal, what care should be taken of her, not only in respect
of the portion of time which is called life, but of eternity</i>! And the
danger of neglecting her from this point of view does indeed appear to
be awful. If death had only been the end of all, the wicked would have
had a good bargain in dying, for they would have been happily quit not
only of their body, but of their own evil together with their souls. But
now, as the soul plainly appears to be immortal, there is no release or
salvation from evil except the attainment of the highest virtue and wisdom.
For the soul when on her progress to the world below takes nothing with
her but nurture and education; which are indeed said greatly to benefit
or greatly to injure the departed, at the very beginning of its pilgrimage
in the other world.
<p>. . . .Wherefore, I say, let a man be of good cheer about his soul,
who has cast away the pleasures and ornaments of the body as alien to him,
and rather hurtful in their effects, and has followed after the pleasures
of knowledge in this life; who has adorned the soul in her own proper jewels,
which are temperance, and justice, and courage, and nobility, and truth-in
these arrayed she is ready to go on her journey to the world below, when
her time comes. You, Simmias and Cebes, and all other men, will depart
at some time or other. Me already, as the tragic poet would say, the voice
of fate calls. Soon I must drink the poison; and I think that I had better
repair to the bath first, in order that the women may not have the trouble
of washing my body after I am dead.
<p>When he had done speaking, Crito said: And have you any commands for
us, Socrates-anything to say about your children, or any other matter in
which we can serve you?
<p>Nothing particular, he said: only, as I have always told you, I would
have you look to yourselves; that is a service which you may always be
doing to me and mine as well as to yourselves. And you need not make professions;
for if you take no thought for yourselves, and walk not according to the
precepts which I have given you, not now for the first time, the warmth
of your professions will be of no avail.
<p>We will do our best, said Crito. But in what way would you have us bury
you?
<p>In any way that you like; only you must get hold of me, and take care
that I do not walk away from you. Then he turned to us, and added with
a smile: I cannot make Crito believe that I am the same Socrates who have
been talking and conducting the argument; he fancies that I am the other
Socrates whom he will soon see, a dead body-and he asks, How shall he bury
me? And though I have spoken many words in the endeavor to show that when
I have drunk the poison I shall leave you and go to the joys of the blessed-these
words of mine, with which I comforted you and myself, have had, I perceive,
no effect upon Crito. And therefore I want you to be surety for me now,
as he was surety for me at the trial: but let the promise be of another
sort; for he was my surety to the judges that I would remain, but you must
be my surety to him that I shall not remain, but go away and depart; and
then he will suffer less at my death, and not be grieved when he sees my
body being burned or buried. I would not have him sorrow at my hard lot,
or say at the burial, Thus we lay out Socrates, or, Thus we follow him
to the grave or bury him; for false words are not only evil in themselves,
but they infect the soul with evil. Be of good cheer, then, my dear Crito,
and say that you are burying my body only, and do with that as is usual,
and as you think best.
<p>When he had spoken these words, he arose and went into the bath chamber
with Crito, who bade us wait; and we waited, talking and thinking of the
subject of discourse, and also of the greatness of our sorrow; he was like
a father of whom we were being bereaved, and we were about to pass the
rest of our lives as orphans. When he had taken the bath his children were
brought to him-(he had two young sons and an elder one); and the women
of his family also came, and he talked to them and gave them a few directions
in the presence of Crito; and he then dismissed them and returned to us.
<p>[30]
<p>Now the hour of sunset was near, for a good deal of time had passed
while he was within. When he came out, he sat down with us again after
his bath, but not much was said. Soon the jailer, who was the servant of
the Eleven, entered and stood by him, saying: To you, Socrates, whom I
know to be the noblest and gentlest and best of all who ever came to this
place, I will not impute the angry feelings of other men, who rage and
swear at me when, in obedience to the authorities, I bid them drink the
poison-indeed, I am sure that you will not be angry with me; for others,
as you are aware, and not I, are the guilty cause. And so fare you well,
and try to bear lightly what must needs be; you know my errand. Then bursting
into tears he turned away and went out.
<p>Socrates looked at him and said: I return your good wishes, and will
do as you bid. Then, turning to us, he said, How charming the man is: since
I have been in prison he has always been coming to see me, and at times
he would talk to me, and was as good as could be to me, and now see how
generously he sorrows for me. But we must do as he says, Crito; let the
cup be brought, if the poison is prepared: if not, let the attendant prepare
some.
<p>Yet, said Crito, the sun is still upon the hilltops, and many a one
has taken the draught late, and after the announcement has been made to
him, he has eaten and drunk, and indulged in sensual delights; do not hasten
then, there is still time.
<p>Socrates said: Yes, Crito, and they of whom you speak are right in doing
thus, for they think that they will gain by the delay; but I am right in
not doing thus, for I do not think that I should gain anything by drinking
the poison a little later; I should be sparing and saving a life which
is already gone: I could only laugh at myself for this. Please then to
do as I say, and not to refuse me.
<p>Crito, when he heard this, made a sign to the servant, and the servant
went in, and remained for some time, and then returned with the jailer
carrying a cup of poison. Socrates said: You, my good friend, who are experienced
in these matters, shall give me directions how I am to proceed. The man
answered: You have only to walk about until your legs are heavy, and then
to lie down, and the poison will act. At the same time he handed the cup
to Socrates, who in the easiest and gentlest manner, without the least
fear or change of color or feature, looking at the man with all his eyes,
Echecrates, as his manner was, took the cup and said: What do you say about
making a libation out of this cup to any god? May I, or not? The man answered:
We only prepare, Socrates, just so much as we deem enough. I understand,
he said: yet I may and must pray to the gods to prosper my journey from
this to that other world-may this, then, which is my prayer, be granted
to me. Then holding the cup to his lips, quite readily and cheerfully he
drank off the poison. And hitherto most of us had been able to control
our sorrow; but now when we saw him drinking, and saw too that he had finished
the draught, we could no longer forbear, and in spite of myself my own
tears were flowing fast; so that I covered my face and wept over myself,
for certainly I was not weeping over him, but at the thought of my own
calamity in having lost such a companion. Nor was I the first, for Crito,
when he found himself unable to restrain his tears, had got up and moved
away, and I followed; and at that moment. Apollodorus, who had been weeping
all the time, broke out in a loud cry which made cowards of us all. Socrates
alone retained his calmness: What is this strange outcry? he said. I sent
away the women mainly in order that they might not offend in this way,
for I have heard that a man should die in peace. Be quiet, then, and have
patience.
<p>When we heard that, we were ashamed, and refrained our tears; and he
walked about until, as he said, his legs began to fail, and then he lay
on his back, according to the directions, and the man who gave him the
poison now and then looked at his feet and legs; and after a while he pressed
his foot hard and asked him if he could feel; and he said, no; and then
his leg, and so upwards and upwards, and showed us that he was cold and
stiff. And he felt them himself, and said: When the poison reaches the
heart, that will be the end. He was beginning to grow cold about the groin,
when he uncovered his face, for he had covered himself up, and said (they
were his last words)-he said: Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you
remember to pay the debt? The debt shall be paid, said Crito; is there
anything else? There was no answer to this question; but in a minute or
two a movement was heard, and the attendants uncovered him; his eyes were
set, and Crito closed his eyes and mouth.
<p>Such was the end, Echecrates, of our friend, whom I may truly call the
wisest, and justest, and best of all the men whom I have ever known.
<p><b>THE END</b>
