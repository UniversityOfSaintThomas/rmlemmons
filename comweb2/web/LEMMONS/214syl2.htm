<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080"><U>INTRODUCTION</U>:</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#004080">
</FONT>The most pressing problem in the late 20th century is whether there
is necessarily a universal ethics. If there is not, then ethical relativism
rules. Either reason establishes an objective basis for moral values and
norms or ethics becomes relative to oneself and to one's group. In such
cases of relativism, ethics concerns only power: the power to get others
to adopt and obey certain values and norms. </P>

<P>This course examines the fundamental ethical systems, including ethical
relativism and universalism. Yet, it will argue that relativism not only
involves inconsistencies but that it fails to protect certain truths, e.g.
the dignity of personhood and the evil of racism. The failures of ethical
relativism does not automatically demonstrate which universal ethics is
best. Thus, Utilitarianism, Aristotelian Virtue Theory, Aquinas's Natural
Law, and Kantian Ethics will be studied and their advantages and disadvantages
noted. These studies add depth to the understanding of central problems
in ethical theory while demonstrating the methodology of doing philosophical
ethics. Central to the methodology of ethics is the evaluation of arguments
in favor and against various moral interpretations. As a result, logic
is an invaluable tool for moral evaluation. </P>

<P>The course goes far beyond its initial investigation into the clash
of ethical systems. It also concentrates on developing ethical insight
into various societal issues: for example, abortion, euthanasia, surrogate
motherhood, moral economies and governments. Since ethics is not just an
academic subject but also structures how we actually live our lives, our
exams will concentrate on the application of theory to life. The Midterm
will not only cover material covered in class but will also require morally
evaluating the main character in Dostoevski's<I> Notes From the Underground.</I>
Likewise the Final will include a section that requires evaluating the
moral philosophy presupposed by either Covey's <I>Seven Habits of Highly
Effective People</I> or Carnegie's <I>How to Win Friends and Influence
People</I>. <BR wp="br1">
