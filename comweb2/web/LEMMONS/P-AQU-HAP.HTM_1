<p><strong><center>AQUINAS ON HUMAN HAPPINESS </strong></center>


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I-II.2.1: WHETHER HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN WEALTH?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, It is impossible for man's happiness to consist in wealth. <strong>For</strong> wealth is twofold, as
the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3), viz. natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a
remedy for his natural wants: such as food, drink, clothing, cars, dwellings, and such like, while artificial
wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the
convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.

<p>	Now it is evident that man's happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. <strong>For</strong> wealth of this kind is
sought for the sake of something else, viz. as a support of human nature: <strong>consequently</strong> it cannot be man's
last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. <strong>Therefore</strong> in the order of nature, all such things are
below man, and made for him, according to Ps. 8:8: "Thou hast subjected all things under his feet."

<p>	And as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth; <strong>since</strong> man would not
seek it except <strong>because</strong>, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. <strong>Consequently</strong> much
less can it be considered in the light of the last end. <strong>Therefore</strong> it is impossible for happiness, which is the
last end of man, to consist in wealth.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	

<p><strong>I-II.2.2: WHETHER HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN RESPECT/HONORS?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, It is impossible for happiness to consist in honor/respect. <strong>For</strong> honor/respect is given
to a man on account of some excellence in him; and <strong>consequently</strong> it is a sign and attestation of the
excellence that is in the person honored. <strong>Thus</strong> although honor/respect can result from happiness, happiness
cannot principally consist therein.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I-II.2.4: WHETHER HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN POWER?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, It is impossible for happiness to consist in power; and this for two reasons. First
<strong>because</strong> power has the nature of principle, [to be used to attain something else] whereas happiness has [no
further use]. It is as a last end. Secondly, <strong>because</strong> power [need not always be good as happiness must
always be]. [<strong>So since</strong> happiness is good], any happiness arising from using power arises from the good
done rather than from the power itself.]

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>SUMMARY (I-II.2.4 continued)</strong>

<p><strong>THE INADEQUACIES OF POWER, FAME, RESPECT AND WEALTH FOR HAPPINESS</strong>	

<p>Four general reasons may be given to prove that happiness consists in none of the foregoing external goods,
namely, power, fame, respect and wealth. <em>First,</em> <strong>because</strong>, <strong>since</strong> happiness is man's supreme good, it is
incompatible with any evil. Now all the foregoing can be found both in good and in evil men. <em>Secondly,</em>
<strong>because</strong>, <strong>since</strong> it is the nature of happiness to "satisfy of itself," as stated in Ethic. i, 7, having gained
happiness, man cannot lack any needful good. But after acquiring any one of the foregoing, man may still
lack many goods that are necessary to him; <strong>for</strong> instance, wisdom, bodily health, and such like. <em>Thirdly,</em>
<strong>because</strong>, <strong>since</strong> happiness is <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em>, no evil can accrue to anyone therefrom. This cannot be
said of the foregoing: <strong>for</strong> it is written (Eccles. 5:12) that "riches" are sometimes "kept to the hurt of the
owner"; and the same may be said of the other three. <em>Fourthly,</em> <strong>because</strong> man is ordained to happiness
through principles that are in him; <strong>since</strong> he is ordained thereto naturally. Now the four goods mentioned
above are due rather to external causes, and in most cases to fortune; <strong>for</strong> which reason they are called
goods of fortune. <strong>Therefore</strong> it is evident that happiness nowise consists in the foregoing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><strong>I-II.2.5: WHETHER HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN ANY BODILY GOOD?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>ON THE CONTRARY</strong>, Man surpasses all other animals in regard to happiness. But in bodily
goods he is surpassed by many animals; <strong>for</strong> instance, by the elephant in longevity, by the lion in strength,
by the stag in fleetness. <strong>Therefore</strong> man's happiness does not consist in goods of the body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, It is impossible for man's happiness to consist in the goods of the body; and this <strong>for</strong>
two reasons. <em>First,</em> <strong>because</strong>, if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the
preservation of its being. <strong>Hence</strong> a captain does not intend as a last end, the preservation of the ship
entrusted to him, <strong>since</strong> a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz. to navigation. Now just as the
ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so humans are steered by will and reason;
according to Ecclus. 15:14: "God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own
counsel." Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end: <strong>since</strong> man is not the supreme
good. <strong>Therefore</strong> the last end of man's reason and will cannot be the preservation of man's existence.

<p>	<em>Secondly,</em> <strong>because</strong>, granted that the end of man's will and reason be the preservation of man's
existence, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. <strong>For</strong> man's life consists in soul
and body; and though the life of the body depends on the soul, the life of the human soul depends not on the
body, as shown above (FP, Q75, A2);<strong> [</strong>and so human happiness cannot be identified with a bodily good].
<strong>Consequently</strong> happiness, which is man's last end, cannot consist in goods of the body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I-II.2.6: WHETHER HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN PLEASURE?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>ON THE CONTRARY</strong>, Boethius says (De Consol. iii): "Any one that chooses to look back on
his past excesses, will perceive that pleasures had a sad ending: and if they can render a man happy, there
is no reason why we should not say that the very beasts are happy too."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, <strong>because</strong> bodily delights are more generally known, "the name of pleasure has been
appropriated to them" (Ethic. vii, 13), although other delights excel them: and yet happiness does not
consist in them; <strong>since</strong> the reason that a man is delighted is that he has some fitting good, either in reality, or
in hope, or at least in memory. Now a fitting good, if indeed it be <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em>, is precisely man's
happiness: and if it is <strong><em>imperfect</strong></em>, it is a share of happiness, either proximate, or remote, or at least apparent.
<strong>Therefore</strong> it is evident that neither is delight, which results from <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em>, the very essence of
happiness, but something resulting therefrom.

<p>	But bodily pleasure cannot result from <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em> even in that way. <strong>For</strong> it results from a
good apprehended by sense, which is a power of the soul, which power makes use of the body. Now good
pertaining to the body, and apprehended by sense, cannot be man's <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> good. <strong>For</strong> <strong>since</strong> the rational soul
excels the capacity of corporeal matter, that part of the soul which is independent of a corporeal organ, has
a certain infinity in regard to the body and those parts of the soul which are tied down to the body: just as
immaterial things are in a way infinite as compared to material things, <strong>since</strong> a form is, after a fashion,
contracted and bounded by matter, so that a form which is independent of matter is, in a way, infinite.
<strong>Therefore</strong> sense, which is a power of the body, knows the singular, which is determinate through matter:
whereas the intellect, which is a power independent of matter, knows the universal, which is abstracted
from matter, and contains an infinite number of singulars. <strong>Consequently</strong> it is evident that good which is
fitting to the body, and which causes bodily delight through being apprehended by sense, is not man's
<strong><em>perfect</strong></em> good, but is quite a trifle as compared with the good of the soul. <strong>Hence</strong> it is written (Wis. 7:9) that
"all gold in comparison of her, is as a little sand." And <strong>therefore</strong> bodily pleasure is neither happiness itself,
nor a proper accident of happiness.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I-II.2.7: WHETHER SOME GOOD OF THE SOUL CONSTITUTES HAPPINESS?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 3: Further, perfection is something belonging to that which is perfected. But happiness is a
perfection of man. <strong>Therefore</strong> happiness is something belonging to man. But it is not something belonging
to the body, as shown above (A5). <strong>Therefore</strong> it is something belonging to the soul; and <strong>thus</strong> it consists in
goods of the soul.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, As stated above (Q1, A8), the end is twofold: namely, <em>the thing itself</em>, which we
desire to attain, and the use, namely, <em>the attainment or possession</em> of that thing. If, then, we speak of man's
last end, it is impossible for man's last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. <strong>Because</strong> the
soul [is always present to the self while happiness is not so present]. <strong>Therefore</strong> the soul itself cannot be its
own last end.

<p>	In like manner neither can anything belonging to the soul whether a power, habit, or act. <strong>For</strong> that
good which is the last end, is <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em> fulfilling the desire. Now man's appetite, otherwise the
will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a [particular] good. <strong>Therefore</strong> none of
them can be man's last end.

<p>	But if we speak of man's last end, as to <em>the attainment or possession</em> thereof, or as to any use
whatever of <em>the thing itself</em> desired as an end, <strong>thus</strong> does something of man, in respect of his soul, belong to
his last end: <strong>since</strong> man attains happiness through his soul. <strong>Therefore</strong> <em>the thing itself</em> which is desired as
end, is that which constitutes happiness, and makes man happy; but <em>the attainment</em> of this thing is called
happiness. <strong>Consequently</strong> we must say that happiness is something belonging to the soul; but that which
constitutes happiness is something outside the soul.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 3: Happiness, itself, <strong>since</strong> it is a perfection of the soul, is an inherent good of the soul;
but that which constitutes happiness, viz. which makes man happy, is something outside his soul, as stated
above.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I-II.2.8: WHETHER ANY CREATED GOOD CONSTITUTES MAN'S HAPPINESS?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 2: Further, the last end of each thing is that which, in relation to it, is <strong><em>perfect</strong></em>: <strong>hence</strong> the part
is for the whole, as for its end. But the universe of creatures which is called the macrocosm, is compared to
man who is called the microcosm (Phys. viii, 2), as <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> to <strong><em>imperfect</strong></em>. <strong>Therefore</strong> man's happiness
consists in the whole universe of creatures. <em>[N.B. In the 20th century, this argument would lead to the
conclusion that human happiness consists in preserving the environment and preventing the extinction of
species.]</em> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>ON THE CONTRARY</strong>, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 26): "As the soul is the life of the
body, so God is man's life of happiness: of Whom it is written: 'Happy is that people whose God is the
Lord' (Ps. 143:15)."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, It is impossible for any created good to constitute man's happiness. <strong>For</strong> happiness
is <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em>, which lulls the appetite altogether; else it would not be the last end, if something yet
remained to be desired. Now the object of the will, i.e. of man's appetite, is the universal good; just as the
object of the intellect is the universal true. <strong>Hence</strong> it is evident that naught can lull man's will, save the
universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone; <strong>because</strong> every creature has
goodness by participation. <strong>therefore</strong> God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Ps.
102:5: "Who satisfieth thy desire with good things." <strong>Therefore</strong> God alone constitutes man's happiness.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 1: [Although it is possible for human beings to be <strong><em>like</em></strong> angels], achieving such a
likeness is not the happiness of the last end. [This happiness requires contemplating God, Who] is the
common object of happiness of all the blessed, as being <em>THE</em> infinite and <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> good. <strong>[Furthermore</strong>,
angels are finite beings and as finite beings they are too <strong><em>imperfect</strong></em> to satisfy the human desire for infinite
goodness.]

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 2: If a whole be not the last end, but ordained to a further end, then the last end of a
part thereof is not the whole itself, but something else. Now the universe of creatures, to which man is
compared as part to whole, is not the last end, but is ordained to God, as to its last end. <strong>Therefore</strong> the last
end of man is not the good of the universe, but God himself.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><strong>I-II.3.8: WHETHER HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN THE VISION OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, Final and <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> happiness can consist in nothing else than the vision of the Divine
Essence. To make this clear, two points must be observed. <em>First,</em> man is not perfectly happy, so long as
something remains for him to desire and seek: <em>secondly,</em> that the perfection of any power is determined by
the nature of its object. Now the object of the intellect is "what a thing is," i.e. the essence of a thing,
according to De Anima iii, 6. <strong>therefore</strong> the intellect attains perfection, in so far as it knows the essence of a
thing. If <strong>therefore</strong> an intellect knows the essence of some effect, whereby it is not possible to know the
essence of the cause, i.e. to know of the cause "what it is"; that intellect cannot be said to reach that cause
simply, although it may be able to gather from the effect the knowledge of that the cause is. <strong>Consequently</strong>,
when man knows an effect, and knows that it has a cause, there naturally remains in the man the desire to
know about the cause, "what it is." And this desire is one of wonder, and causes inquiry, as is stated in the
beginning of the Metaphysics (i, 2). <strong>For</strong> instance, if a man, knowing the eclipse of the sun, consider that it
must be due to some cause, and know not what that cause is, he wonders about it, and from wondering
proceeds to inquire. Nor does this inquiry cease until he arrive at a knowledge of the essence of the cause.

<p>	If <strong>therefore</strong> the human intellect, knowing the essence of some created effect, knows no more of
God than "that He is"; the perfection of that intellect does not yet reach simply the First Cause, but there
remains in it the natural desire to seek the cause. <strong>therefore</strong> it is not yet perfectly happy. <strong>Consequently</strong>, <strong>for</strong>
<strong><em>perfect</strong></em> happiness the intellect needs to reach the very Essence of the First Cause. And <strong>thus</strong> it will have its
perfection through union with God as with that object, in which alone man's happiness consists, as stated
above (AA1,7; Q2, A8).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><strong>I-II.5.8: WHETHER EVERY PERSON DESIRES HAPPINESS?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 1: It would seem that not all desire Happiness. <strong>for</strong> no man can desire what he knows not;
<strong>since</strong> the apprehended good is the object of the appetite (De Anima iii, 10). But many know not what
Happiness is. This is evident from the fact that, as Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 4), "some thought that
Happiness consists in pleasures of the body; some, in a virtue of the soul; some in other things." <strong>Therefore</strong>
not all desire Happiness.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, Happiness can be considered in two ways. First according to the general notion of
happiness: and <strong>thus</strong>, of necessity, every man desires happiness. <strong>For</strong> the general notion of happiness
consists in <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em>, as stated above (AA3,4). But <strong>since</strong> good is the object of the will, <strong><em>THE
perfect Good</strong></em> of a man is that which entirely satisfies his will. <strong>Consequently</strong> to desire happiness is nothing
else than to desire that one's will be satisfied. And this everyone desires. Secondly we may speak of
Happiness according to its specific notion, as to that in which it consists. And <strong>thus</strong> all do not know
Happiness; <strong>because</strong> they know not in what thing the general notion of happiness is found. And
<strong>consequently</strong>, in this respect, not all desire it. <strong>therefore</strong> the reply to the first Objection is clear.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p><strong><center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></center>


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I-II.4.5: WHETHER THE BODY IS NECESSARY for HUMAN HAPPINESS?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 5: Further, Happiness is the sufficient good and lulls desire. But this cannot be said of the
separated soul; <strong>for</strong> it yet desires to be united to the body, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35).
<strong>Therefore</strong> the soul is not happy while separated from the body.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 6: Further, in Happiness man is equal to the angels. But the soul without the body is not equal
to the angels, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35). <strong>Therefore</strong> it is not happy.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, Happiness is twofold; the one is <strong><em>imperfect</strong></em> and is had in this life; the other is
<strong><em>perfect</strong></em>, consisting in the vision of God. Now it is evident that the body is necessary for the happiness of
this life. <strong>For</strong> the happiness of this life consists in an operation of the intellect, either speculative or
practical. And the operation of the intellect in this life cannot be without a <em>sense image</em>, which is only in a
bodily organ, as was shown in the FP, Q84, AA6,7. <strong>Consequently</strong> that happiness which can be had in this
life, depends, in a way, on the body. But as to <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> Happiness, which consists in the vision of God,  it is
evident that the Divine Essence cannot be seen by means of sense images, as stated in the FP, Q12, A3.
<strong>therefore</strong>, <strong>since</strong> man's <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> Happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence, it does not depend on
the body. <strong>Consequently</strong>, without the body the soul can be happy.

<p>	We must, however, notice that something may belong to a thing's perfection in <em>two</em> ways. <em>First</em>, as
constituting the essence thereof; <strong>thus</strong> the soul is necessary for man's perfection. <em>Secondly</em>, as necessary for
its well-being: <strong>thus</strong>, beauty of body and keenness of perfection belong to man's perfection. <strong>therefore</strong>
though the body does not belong in the first way to the perfection of human Happiness, yet it does in the
second way. <strong>For</strong> <strong>since</strong> operation depends on a thing's nature, the more <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> is the soul in its nature, the
more perfectly it has its proper operation, wherein its happiness consists.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 5: The desire of the separated soul is entirely at rest, as regards the thing desired; <strong>since</strong>,
to wit, it has that which suffices its appetite. But it is not wholly at rest, as regards the desirer, <strong>since</strong> it does
not possess that good in every way that it would wish to possess it. <strong>Consequently</strong>, after the body has been
resumed, Happiness increases not in intensity, but in extent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 6: [The separated soul may or may not be the equal of angels; <strong>because</strong> some souls are
raised through grace higher than some] angels, <strong>thus</strong> seeing God more clearly than the lower angels. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><strong>I-II.4.7: WHETHER ANY EXTERNAL GOODS ARE NECESSARY for HAPPINESS?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, <strong>for</strong> <em><strong>imperfect</strong> happiness</em>, such as can be had in this life, external goods are
necessary, not as belonging to the <em>essence</em> of happiness, but by serving as <em>instruments</em> to happiness, which
consists in an operation of virtue, as stated in Ethic. i, 13. <strong>for</strong> man needs in this life, the necessaries of the
body, both for the operation of contemplative virtue, and for the operation of active virtue, for which latter
he needs also many other things by means of which to perform its operations.

<p>	<em>On the other hand,</em> such goods as these are nowise necessary for <em><strong>perfect</strong> Happiness</em>, which
consists in seeing God. <strong>The reason of this</strong> is that all such like external goods are requisite either for the
support of the animal body; or for certain operations which belong to human life, which we perform by
means of the animal body: whereas that <em><strong>perfect</strong> Happiness</em> which consists in seeing God, will be either in
the soul separated from the body, or in the soul united to the body then no longer animal but spiritual.
<strong>Consequently</strong> these external goods are nowise necessary for <em>that</em> Happiness, <strong>since</strong> they are ordained to the
animal life. And <strong>since</strong>, in this life, the felicity of contemplation, as being more Godlike, approaches nearer
than that of action to the likeness of that <em><strong>perfect</strong> Happiness,</em> <strong>therefore</strong> it stands in less need of these goods
of the body as stated in Ethic. x, 8.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I-II.4.8: WHETHER THE FELLOWSHIP OF FRIENDS IS NECESSARY for HAPPINESS?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 2: Further, Boethius [*Seneca, Ep. 6] says that "there is no delight in possessing any good
whatever, without someone to share it with us." But delight is necessary for Happiness. <strong>Therefore</strong>
fellowship of friends is also necessary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>ON THE CONTRARY</strong>, It is written (Wis. 7:11): "All good things came to me together with her,"
i.e. with divine wisdom, which consists in contemplating God. <strong>Consequently</strong> nothing else is necessary for
Happiness.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, If we speak of <em>the happiness of this life</em>, the happy man needs friends, as the
Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 9), not, indeed, to make use of them, <strong>since</strong> he suffices himself; nor to delight in
them, <strong>since</strong> he possesses <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> delight in the operation of virtue; but for the purpose of a good operation,
viz. that he may do good to them; that he may delight in seeing them do good; and again that he may be
helped by them in his good work. <strong>For</strong> in order that man may do well, whether in the works of the active
life, or in those of the contemplative life, he needs the fellowship of friends.

<p>	But if we speak of <em><strong>perfect</strong> Happiness which will be in our heavenly Fatherland, </em>the fellowship of
friends is not essential to Happiness; <strong>since</strong> man has the entire fulness of his perfection in God. But the
fellowship of friends conduces to the <em>well-being</em> of Happiness. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 2: This saying is to be understood of the possession of good that does not fully satisfy.
This does not apply to the question under consideration; <strong>because</strong> man possesses in God a sufficiency of
every good.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I-II.5.2: WHETHER ONE CAN BE HAPPIER THAN ANOTHER?</strong>
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><strong>I answer that</strong>, As stated above (Q1, A8; Q2, A7), Happiness implies two things, to wit, the last end itself,
i.e. the Sovereign Good; and the attainment or enjoyment of that same Good. As to that Good itself, Which
is the object and cause of Happiness, one Happiness cannot be greater than another, <strong>since</strong> there is but one
Sovereign Good, namely, God, by enjoying Whom, men are made happy. But as to the attainment or
enjoyment of this Good, one man can be happier than another; <strong>because</strong> the more a man enjoys this Good
the happier he is. Now, that one man enjoys God more than another, happens through his being better
disposed or ordered to the enjoyment of Him. And in this sense one man can be happier than another.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><strong>I-II.5.3: WHETHER ONE CAN BE HAPPY IN THIS LIFE?</strong>
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><strong>I answer that</strong>, A certain participation of Happiness can be had in this life: but <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> and true Happiness
cannot be had in this life. This may be seen from a twofold consideration.

<p>	<em>First,</em> from the general notion of happiness. <strong>For</strong> <strong>since</strong> happiness is a "perfect and sufficient good,"
it excludes every evil, and fulfils every desire. But in this life every evil cannot be excluded. <strong>For</strong> this
present life is subject to many unavoidable evils; to ignorance on the part of the intellect; to inordinate
affection on the part of the appetite, and to many penalties on the part of the body; as Augustine sets forth
in De Civ. Dei xix, 4. Likewise neither can the desire for good be satiated in this life. <strong>For</strong> man naturally
desires the good, which he has, to be abiding. Now the goods of the present life pass away; <strong>since</strong> life itself
passes away, which we naturally desire to have, and would wish to hold abidingly, <strong>for</strong> man naturally
shrinks from death. <strong>therefore</strong> it is impossible to have true Happiness in this life.

<p>	<em>Secondly,</em> from a consideration of the specific nature of Happiness, viz. the vision of the Divine
Essence, which man cannot obtain in this life, as was shown in the FP, Q12, A11. <strong>Hence</strong> it is evident that
none can attain true and <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> Happiness in this life.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I-II.5.5: WHETHER ONE CAN ATTAIN HAPPINESS BY HIS NATURAL POWERS?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, <em><strong>imperfect</strong> happiness</em> that can be had in this life, can be acquired by man by his
natural powers, in the same way as virtue, in whose operation it consists: on this point we shall speak
further on (Q63). But man's <em><strong>perfect</strong> Happiness</em>, as stated above (Q3, A8), consists in the vision of the
Divine Essence. Now the vision of God's Essence surpasses the nature not only of man, but also of every
creature, as was shown in the FP, Q12, A4. <strong>For</strong> the natural knowledge of every creature is in keeping with
the mode of his substance: <strong>thus</strong> it is said of the intelligence (De Causis; Prop. viii) that "it knows things
that are above it, and things that are below it, according to the mode of its substance." But every knowledge
that is according to the mode of created substance, falls short of the vision of the Divine Essence, which
infinitely surpasses all created substance. <strong>Consequently</strong> neither man, nor any creature, can attain final
Happiness by his natural powers.

<p><strong><strong>I-II.5.1: WHETHER [PERFECT HAPPINESS IS MERELY A DREAM?]</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, Happiness is the attainment of <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em>. Whoever, <strong>therefore</strong>, is capable
of <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em> can attain Happiness. Now, that man is capable of <strong><em>THE perfect Good</strong></em>, is proved
both <strong>because</strong> his intellect can apprehend the universal and <strong><em>perfect</strong></em> good, and <strong>because</strong> his will can desire it.
And <strong>therefore</strong> man can attain Happiness. This can be proved again from the fact that man is capable of
seeing God, as stated in FP, Q12, A1: in which vision, as we stated above (Q3, A8) man's <strong><em>perfect</strong></em>
Happiness consists.

<p><strong>SECTION COMMENTARY:</strong>

<p>	In this selection of arguments we see Aquinas defending two main claims. [1] Every human being
desires happiness defined as perfect goodness, even though human beings differ upon WHAT they identify
as perfect goodness.  [2] Human happiness is divisible into perfect and imperfect. Perfect happiness is
impossible in this life because human nature is not satisfied until the essence of God is directly known.
Imperfect happiness is possible in this life and it requires many things that are not required for perfect
happiness.  These claims presuppose a philosophy of person that characterizes human beings as
hylomorphic beings that are primarily rational.
