<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">FIRST PAPER ASSIGNMENT</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch George of
the Jungle, note its postmodern and non postmodern elements, and determine
the following: (1) whether the movie as a whole ought to be considered
as postmodern; (2) whether its depiction of romantic love is postmodern;
and (3) whether it is really possible for romantic love to be both forever
and primarily characterized by postmodern elements.&nbsp; Write a short
paper of one to two pages justifying your answers and prepare a handout
summarizing your arguments. Both are due Tuesday, Feb. 15th.</font></b>
