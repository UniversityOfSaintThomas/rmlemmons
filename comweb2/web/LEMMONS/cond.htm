<P><B>I. Conditional Arguments: The Rules</B> <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>a-1. Valid modus ponens</B>: If a then b. But a. Thus, b. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P>a-2. The rule: Always affirm the antecedent in the premises and then
affirm the consequent in the conclusion. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P>a-3: Example of a valid ponens: If it is raining, the grass is wet.
It is raining. Therefore the grass is wet. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>a-4. Invalid ponens</B>: </P>

<P>---If a then b. But b, thus a. Invalid because of the fallacy of affirming
the consequent. Example: If it is raining, the grass is wet. The grass
is wet. Therefore, it is raining. (That this ponens is invalid can be easily
seen if one considers that wet grass could be caused by flooding or by
irrigation. So wet grass need not be caused by rain. </P>

<P>---If a then b. But a, thus not b. Invalid because the consequent was
not affirmed. Example: If it is raining, the grass is wet. It is raining.
Therefore, the grass is dry. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">

<BR wp="br2">
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>b-1. Valid modus tollens:</B> If a then b. not b, thus not a. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P>b-2. The rule: Always deny the consequent in the premises and then deny
the antecedent in the conclusion. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P>b-3: Example of a valid tollens: If it is raining, the grass is wet.
The grass is not wet. Therefore, it is not raining. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P>b-4. <I>Invalid tollens: </I></P>

<P>---if a then b, but not a, thus not b. Invalid because of the fallacy
of denying the antecedent. Example: If it is raining, the grass is wet.
It is not raining. Therefore, the grass is not wet. (The invalidity of
this argument can easily be seen once one considers that grass can be wet
from a flood or by an irrigation system even when it is not raining.) </P>

<P>---if a then b, not b, thus a. Invalid because the conclusion should
deny the antecedent. Example: If it is raining, the grass is wet. The grass
is dry. Therefore it is raining. <BR wp="br1">

<P><B>II: Exercises </B></P>

<P><B>Identify whether the following are ponens or tollens and then determine
whether they are valid or invalid. If invalid, explain why. </B></P>

<P><B>1. If it is snowing, I'm going skiing. It is snowing. Therefore,
I'm going skiing. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
2. If it is sunny, I will not go home. I am going home. Therefore, it is
not sunny. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
3. If Mr. Zero confesses, he is guilty. He is not guilty, therefore he
will not confess. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
4. If the dog barks, he wants to go outside. He wants to go outside, hence
the dog is barking. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
5. If the boss laughs, then you can give him an honest report. The boss
is not laughing so you better not give him your report. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
6. If the birds are singing, it is daylight. The birds are singing. Therefore
it is daylight. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
7. If the horse kicks, then give him hay. The horse is kicking, so you
will not give him hay. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
8. If the doctor prescribes an antibiotic, then one should not stop until
there are no pills to take. Zeos should stop before he takes all the pills,
therefore a doctor did not prescribe an antibiotic. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
9. If one exercises, one is healthy. One is exercising. Thus one is healthy.
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
