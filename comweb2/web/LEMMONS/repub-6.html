<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>Translated by Benjamin Jowett</CENTER>


<P>e, he said, which is the author&nbsp;<A NAME="1078"></A>of science and
truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely&nbsp;<A NAME="1079"></A>cannot
mean to say that pleasure is the good?&nbsp;<A NAME="1080"></A>

<P>God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image&nbsp;<A NAME="1081"></A>in
another point of view?&nbsp;<A NAME="1082"></A>

<P>In what point of view?&nbsp;<A NAME="1083"></A>
<BR>You would say, would you not, that the sun is only the author of visibility&nbsp;<A NAME="1084"></A>in
all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and growth, though&nbsp;<A NAME="1085"></A>he
himself is not generation?&nbsp;<A NAME="1086"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1087"></A>
<BR>In like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="1088"></A>to
all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet the good is&nbsp;<A NAME="1089"></A>not
essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and&nbsp;<A NAME="1090"></A>power.&nbsp;<A NAME="1091"></A>

<P>Glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of heaven,&nbsp;<A NAME="1092"></A>how
amazing!&nbsp;<A NAME="1093"></A>

<P>Yes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you&nbsp;<A NAME="1094"></A>made
me utter my fancies.&nbsp;<A NAME="1095"></A>

<P>And pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there&nbsp;<A NAME="1096"></A>is
anything more to be said about the similitude of the&nbsp;<A NAME="1097"></A>sun.&nbsp;<A NAME="1098"></A>

<P>Yes, I said, there is a great deal more.&nbsp;<A NAME="1099"></A>
<BR>Then omit nothing, however slight.&nbsp;<A NAME="1100"></A>
<BR>I will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal will&nbsp;<A NAME="1101"></A>have
to be omitted.&nbsp;<A NAME="1102"></A>

<P>You have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1103"></A>that
one of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the&nbsp;<A NAME="1104"></A>visible.
I do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing upon&nbsp;<A NAME="1105"></A>the
name ('ourhanoz, orhatoz'). May I suppose that you have this distinction&nbsp;<A NAME="1106"></A>of
the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?&nbsp;<A NAME="1107"></A>

<P>I have.&nbsp;<A NAME="1108"></A>
<BR>Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide&nbsp;<A NAME="1109"></A>each
of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main divisions&nbsp;<A NAME="1110"></A>to
answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible, and then&nbsp;<A NAME="1111"></A>compare
the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness,&nbsp;<A NAME="1112"></A>and
you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists&nbsp;<A NAME="1113"></A>of
images. And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the&nbsp;<A NAME="1114"></A>second
place, reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies&nbsp;<A NAME="1115"></A>and
the like: Do you understand?&nbsp;<A NAME="1116"></A>

<P>Yes, I understand.&nbsp;<A NAME="1117"></A>
<BR>Imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance,&nbsp;<A NAME="1118"></A>to
include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is&nbsp;<A NAME="1119"></A>made.&nbsp;<A NAME="1120"></A>

<P>Very good.&nbsp;<A NAME="1121"></A>
<BR>Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different&nbsp;<A NAME="1122"></A>degrees
of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of&nbsp;<A NAME="1123"></A>opinion
is to the sphere of knowledge?&nbsp;<A NAME="1124"></A>

<P>Most undoubtedly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1125"></A>
<BR>Next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual&nbsp;<A NAME="1126"></A>is
to be divided.&nbsp;<A NAME="1127"></A>

<P>In what manner?&nbsp;<A NAME="1128"></A>
<BR>Thus: --There are two subdivisions, in the lower or which the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="1129"></A>uses
the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can&nbsp;<A NAME="1130"></A>only
be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends&nbsp;<A NAME="1131"></A>to
the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses,&nbsp;<A NAME="1132"></A>and
goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of&nbsp;<A NAME="1133"></A>images
as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through the ideas&nbsp;<A NAME="1134"></A>themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="1135"></A>

<P>I do not quite understand your meaning, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1136"></A>
<BR>Then I will try again; you will understand me better when I have made&nbsp;<A NAME="1137"></A>some
preliminary remarks. You are aware that students of geometry, arithmetic,&nbsp;<A NAME="1138"></A>and
the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and&nbsp;<A NAME="1139"></A>three
kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science;&nbsp;<A NAME="1140"></A>these
are their hypotheses, which they and everybody are supposed to know,&nbsp;<A NAME="1141"></A>and
therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="1142"></A>or
others; but they begin with them, and go on until they arrive at last,&nbsp;<A NAME="1143"></A>and
in a consistent manner, at their conclusion?&nbsp;<A NAME="1144"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, I know.&nbsp;<A NAME="1145"></A>
<BR>And do you not know also that although they make use of the visible&nbsp;<A NAME="1146"></A>forms
and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the&nbsp;<A NAME="1147"></A>ideals
which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but of&nbsp;<A NAME="1148"></A>the
absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on --the forms which&nbsp;<A NAME="1149"></A>they
draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water of their&nbsp;<A NAME="1150"></A>own,
are converted by them into images, but they are really seeking to&nbsp;<A NAME="1151"></A>behold
the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the&nbsp;<A NAME="1152"></A>mind?&nbsp;<A NAME="1153"></A>

<P>That is true.&nbsp;<A NAME="1154"></A>
<BR>And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible, although in the search&nbsp;<A NAME="1155"></A>after
it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to a first&nbsp;<A NAME="1156"></A>principle,
because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis,&nbsp;<A NAME="1157"></A>but
employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in&nbsp;<A NAME="1158"></A>their
turn as images, they having in relation to the shadows and reflections&nbsp;<A NAME="1159"></A>of
them a greater distinctness, and therefore a higher&nbsp;<A NAME="1160"></A>value.&nbsp;<A NAME="1161"></A>

<P>I understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of&nbsp;<A NAME="1162"></A>geometry
and the sister arts.&nbsp;<A NAME="1163"></A>

<P>And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you&nbsp;<A NAME="1164"></A>will
understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason&nbsp;<A NAME="1165"></A>herself
attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as&nbsp;<A NAME="1166"></A>first
principles, but only as hypotheses --that is to say, as steps and&nbsp;<A NAME="1167"></A>points
of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order that&nbsp;<A NAME="1168"></A>she
may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and clinging&nbsp;<A NAME="1169"></A>to
this and then to that which depends on this, by successive steps she&nbsp;<A NAME="1170"></A>descends
again without the aid of any sensible object, from ideas, through&nbsp;<A NAME="1171"></A>ideas,
and in ideas she ends.&nbsp;<A NAME="1172"></A>

<P>I understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me&nbsp;<A NAME="1173"></A>to
be describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, I&nbsp;<A NAME="1174"></A>understand
you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of dialectic&nbsp;<A NAME="1175"></A>contemplates,
are clearer than the notions of the arts, as they are termed,&nbsp;<A NAME="1176"></A>which
proceed from hypotheses only: these are also contemplated by the&nbsp;<A NAME="1177"></A>understanding,
and not by the senses: yet, because they start from hypotheses&nbsp;<A NAME="1178"></A>and
do not ascend to a principle, those who contemplate them appear to&nbsp;<A NAME="1179"></A>you
not to exercise the higher reason upon them, although when a first&nbsp;<A NAME="1180"></A>principle
is added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason. And&nbsp;<A NAME="1181"></A>the
habit which is concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences I suppose&nbsp;<A NAME="1182"></A>that
you would term understanding and not reason, as being intermediate&nbsp;<A NAME="1183"></A>between
opinion and reason.&nbsp;<A NAME="1184"></A>

<P>You have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, corresponding&nbsp;<A NAME="1185"></A>to
these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul-reason&nbsp;<A NAME="1186"></A>answering
to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or conviction)&nbsp;<A NAME="1187"></A>to
the third, and perception of shadows to the last-and let there be a&nbsp;<A NAME="1188"></A>scale
of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness&nbsp;<A NAME="1189"></A>in
the same degree that their objects have truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="1190"></A>

<P>I understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your&nbsp;<A NAME="1191"></A>arrangement.&nbsp;<A NAME="end"></A>
