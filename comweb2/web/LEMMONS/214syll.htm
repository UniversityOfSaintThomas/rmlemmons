<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080"><U>INTRODUCTION</U>:</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#004080">
</FONT>The most pressing problem in the late 20th century is whether there
is necessarily a universal ethics. If there is not, then ethical relativism
rules. Either reason establishes an objective basis for moral values and
norms or ethics becomes relative to oneself and to one's group. In such
cases of relativism, ethics concerns only power: the power to get others
to adopt and obey certain values and norms.

<P>This course examines the fundamental ethical systems, including ethical
relativism and universalism. Yet, it will argue that relativism not only
involves inconsistencies but that it fails to protect certain truths, e.g.
the dignity of personhood and the evil of racism. The failures of ethical
relativism does not automatically demonstrate which universal ethics is
best. Thus, Utilitarianism, Aristotelian Virtue Theory, Aquinas's Natural
Law, and Kantian Ethics will be studied and their advantages and disadvantages
noted. These studies add depth to the understanding of central problems
in ethical theory while demonstrating the methodology of doing philosophical
ethics. Central to the methodology of ethics is the evaluation of arguments
in favor and against various moral interpretations. As a result, logic
is an invaluable tool for moral evaluation.

<P><B><U><FONT COLOR="#004080">COURSE OBJECTIVES</FONT></U></B>

<P>(1) To examine opposing ethics and to ascertain their productiveness
in establishing accurate moral codes; (2) To facilitate the student's ability
to argue philosophically about appropriate values and norms both theoretically
and in application to concrete situations; (3) To determine why one should
be moral; (4) To offer an ethics that is helpful in achieving personal
happiness and in promoting the common good; and (5) To enable students
to determine why something ought to be done and why something ought not
be done.
