<p><strong>I.84.1: WHETHER THE SOUL KNOWS BODIES THROUGH THE INTELLECT?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, Science is in the intellect. If, <strong>therefore</strong>, the intellect does not know bodies,
<strong>it follows that</strong> there is no science of bodies; and <strong>thus</strong> perishes natural science, which treats of mobile
bodies.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, It should be said in order to elucidate this question, that the <em>early philosophers</em>,
who inquired into the natures of things, thought there was nothing in the world save bodies. And <strong>because</strong>
they observed that all bodies are mobile, and considered them to be ever in a state of flux, they were of
opinion that we can have no certain knowledge of the true nature of things. <strong>For</strong> what is in a continual state
of flux, cannot be grasped with any degree of <em>certitude</em>, <strong>for</strong> it passes away ere the mind can form a
judgment thereon: according to the saying of Heraclitus, that "it is not possible twice to touch a drop of
water in a passing torrent," as the Philosopher relates (Metaph. iv, Did. iii, 5).

<p>	After these came <em>Plato</em>, who, wishing to save the <em>certitude</em> of our knowledge of truth through the
intellect, maintained that, besides these things corporeal, there is another genus of beings, separate from
matter and movement, which beings he called "species" or "ideas," by participation of which each one of
these singular and sensible things is said to be either a man, or a horse, or the like. <strong>Therefore</strong> he said that
sciences and definitions, and whatever appertains to the act of the intellect, are not referred to these sensible
bodies, but to those beings immaterial and separate: so that according to this the soul does not understand
these corporeal things, but the separate species thereof.

<p>	Now <strong>this may be shown to be false for two reasons</strong>. <em>First</em>, <strong>because</strong>, <strong>since</strong> those species are
immaterial and immovable, knowledge of movement and matter would be excluded from science (which
knowledge is proper to natural science), and likewise all demonstration through moving and material
causes. <em>Secondly</em>, <strong>because</strong> it seems ridiculous, when we seek for knowledge of things which are to us
manifest, to introduce other beings, which cannot be the substance of those others, <strong>since</strong> they differ from
them essentially: so that granted that we have a knowledge of those separate substances, we cannot <strong>for</strong> that
reason claim to form a judgment concerning these sensible things.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.84.2: WHETHER ... KNOWLEDGE IS MATERIAL?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, ... knowledge cannot be material; . . .if it were necessary for the thing known to
exist materially in the knower, there would be no reason why things which have a material existence outside
the soul should be devoid of knowledge; why, <strong>for</strong> instance, if by fire the soul knows fire, that fire also
which is outside the soul should not have knowledge of fire.

<p>	We must conclude, <strong>therefore</strong>, that material things known must needs exist in the knower, not
materially, but immaterially. <strong>The reason of this</strong> is, <strong>because</strong> the act of knowledge extends to things outside
the knower: <strong>for</strong> we know things even that are external to us. Now [matter individuates so that it is] by
matter that the form of a thing is determined to some one thing. <strong>Therefore</strong> [to know another as other
requires some degree of immateriality]. Hence it is clear that knowledge is in inverse ratio of materiality.
And <strong>consequently</strong> things that are not receptive of forms save materially, have no power of knowledge
whatever---such as plants, as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 12). But the more immaterially a thing
receives the form of the thing known, the more perfect is its knowledge. <strong>Therefore</strong> the intellect which
abstracts the species not only from matter, but also from the individuating conditions of matter, has more
perfect knowledge than the senses, which receive the form of the thing known, without matter indeed, but
subject to material conditions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.84.3: WHETHER THE SOUL UNDERSTANDS ALL THINGS THROUGH <em>INNATE IDEAS</em>?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	OBJ 3: Further, no one can answer the truth except concerning what he knows. But even a person
untaught and devoid of acquired knowledge, answers the truth to every question if put to him in orderly
fashion, as we find related in the <em>Meno</em> (xv seqq.) of <em>Plato</em>, concerning a certain individual. <strong>Therefore</strong> we
have some knowledge of things even before we acquire knowledge; which would not be the case unless we
had <em>innate ideas</em>. <strong>Therefore</strong> the soul understands corporeal things through <em>innate ideas</em>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, The Philosopher, speaking of the intellect, says (De Anima iii, 4) that it is
like "a tablet on which nothing is written."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, . . .[innate ideas are unreasonable].

<p>	<em>First</em>, <strong>because</strong>, if the soul has a natural knowledge of all things, it seems impossible for the soul so
far to forget the existence of such knowledge as not to know itself to be possessed thereof, . . .And
especially unreasonable does this seem if we suppose that it is natural to the soul to be united to the body,
as we have established above (Q76, A1): <strong>for</strong> it is unreasonable that the natural operation of a thing be
totally hindered by that which belongs to it naturally.

<p>	 <em>Secondly</em>, the falseness of this opinion is clearly proved from the fact that if a sense be wanting,
the knowledge of what is apprehended through that sense is wanting also: <strong>for</strong> instance, a man who is born
blind can have no knowledge of colors. This would not be the case if the soul had innate images of all
intelligible things. We must <strong>therefore</strong> conclude that the soul does not know corporeal things through <em>innate
ideas</em>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Reply OBJ 3: If questions be put in an orderly fashion they proceed from universal self-evident
principles to what is particular. Now by such a process knowledge is produced in the mind of the learner.
<strong>Therefore</strong> when he answers the truth to a subsequent question, this is not <strong>because</strong> he had knowledge
previously, but <strong>because</strong> he <strong>thus</strong> learns for the first time. <strong>For</strong> it matters not whether the teacher proceed
from universal principles to conclusions by questioning or by asserting; <strong>for</strong> in either case the mind of the
listener is assured of what follows by that which preceded.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.84.4: WHETHER THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES ARE DERIVED BY THE SOUL FROM
CERTAIN SEPARATE FORMS?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, If this were true we should not need the senses in order to understand. And
this is proved to be false especially from the fact that if a man be wanting in a sense, he cannot have any
knowledge of the sensibles corresponding to that sense.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, . . .[if the soul did not learn from the senses], then no sufficient reason can be
assigned for the soul being united to the body, . . .<strong>since</strong> as to its being the soul does not depend on the body.
So if the soul by its very nature had an inborn aptitude for receiving intelligible species only through the
influence of certain separate principles, and were not to receive them from the senses, it would not need the
body in order to understand: <strong>therefore</strong> to no purpose would it be united to the body. ....

<p>	And if it be said with <em>Avicenna</em>, that the senses are necessary to the soul, <strong>because</strong> by them it is
aroused to turn to [some divine being] from which it receives the species: neither is this a sufficient
explanation for the body's existence through the soul. <strong>Because</strong> if it is natural for the soul to understand
through species [derived from a divine being and not from the senses], <strong>then it follows that</strong> at times the soul
of an individual wanting in one of the senses can turn to this [divinity and] ... receive the intelligible species
of which the corresponding sensible species are wanting. And <strong>thus</strong> a man born blind could have knowledge
of colors; which is clearly untrue. We must <strong>therefore</strong> conclude that the intelligible species, by which our
soul understands, are [derived from the senses].

<p><strong>I.84.6: WHETHER SENSATION SUFFICES FOR INTELLECTUAL KNOWLEDGE?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, The Philosopher says (Metaph. i, 1; Poster. ii, 15) that the principle of
knowledge is in the senses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, .... <em>Aristotle</em> argues that [sensible things make possible intellectual knowledge
through the mediation of the phantasms]. However, <em>Aristotle</em> held that the intellect has an operation which
is independent of the body's cooperation. Now nothing corporeal can make an impression on the
incorporeal, <u><strong><em>therefore</em></strong></u> the impression caused by the sensible does not suffice, but something more noble is
required . . .[Thus the intellect must actively abstract its knowledge from the sense images.] <strong>Therefore</strong>, it
cannot be said that sensible knowledge is the total and perfect cause of intellectual knowledge, but rather
that it is in a way the material cause.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.84.7: WHETHER THE INTELLECT ALWAYS REQUIRES [THE BRAIN AND ITS SENSE
IMAGES] IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND? </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, The Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 7) that "the soul understands nothing
without a sense image."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, In the present state of life, . . . it is impossible for our intellect to understand
anything actually, except by turning to the sense images. <em>First</em> of all <strong>because</strong> the intellect, being a power
that does not make use of a corporeal organ, would in no way be hindered in its act through the lesion of a
corporeal organ, if for its act there were not required the act of some power that does make use of a
corporeal organ. Now sense, imagination and the other powers belonging to the sensitive part, make use of
a corporeal organ. <strong>Therefore</strong> it is clear that for the intellect to understand actually, not only when it
acquires fresh knowledge, but also when it applies knowledge already acquired, there is need for the act of
the imagination and of the other powers. <strong>For</strong> when the act of the imagination is hindered by a lesion of the
corporeal organ, <strong>for</strong> instance in a case of frenzy; or when the act of the memory is hindered, as in the case
of lethargy, we see that a man is hindered from actually understanding things of which he had a previous
knowledge. Secondly, anyone can experience this of himself, that when he tries to understand something, he
forms certain sense images to serve him by way of examples, in which as it were he examines what he is
desirous of understanding. <strong>For this reason</strong> it is that when we wish to help someone to understand
something, we lay examples before him, from which he forms sense images for the purpose of
understanding.

<p>	Now <strong>the reason of this</strong> is that ...the nature of a stone or any material thing cannot be known
completely and truly, except in as much as it is known as existing in the individual. Now we apprehend the
individual through the senses and the imagination. And, <strong>therefore</strong>, for the intellect to understand actually
its proper object, it must of necessity turn to the sense images in order to perceive the universal nature
existing in the individual. But if the proper object of our intellect were a separate form; or if, as the
Platonists say, the natures of sensible things subsisted apart from the individual; there would be no need for
the intellect to turn to the sense images whenever it understands.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.84.8: WHETHER THE JUDGMENT OF THE INTELLECT IS HINDERED THROUGH
SUSPENSION OF THE SENSITIVE POWERS?        </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, As we have said above (A7), our intellect's proper and proportionate object is the
nature of a sensible thing. Now a perfect judgment concerning anything cannot be formed, unless all that
pertains to that thing's nature be known; especially if that be ignored which is the term and end of
judgment. Now the Philosopher says (De Coel. iii), that "as the end of a practical science is action, so the
end of natural science is that which is perceived principally through the senses"; <strong>for</strong> the smith does not seek
knowledge of a knife except for the purpose of action, in order that he may produce a certain individual
knife; and in like manner the natural philosopher does not seek to know the nature of a stone and of a horse,
save for the purpose of knowing the essential properties of those things which he perceives with his senses.
Now it is clear that a smith cannot judge perfectly of a knife unless he knows the action of the knife: and in
like manner the natural philosopher cannot judge perfectly of natural things, unless he knows sensible
things. But in the present state of life whatever we understand, we know by comparison to natural sensible
things. <strong>Consequently</strong> it is not possible for our intellect to form a perfect judgment, while the senses are
suspended, through which sensible things are known to us.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.85.1: WHETHER OUR INTELLECT UNDERSTANDS CORPOREAL AND MATERIAL
THINGS BY ABSTRACTION FROM Sense images?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, As stated above (Q84, A7), the object of knowledge is proportionate to the power
of knowledge. Now there are three grades of the cognitive powers. <strong>For</strong> one cognitive power, namely, the
sense, is the act of a corporeal organ. And <strong>therefore</strong> the object of every sensitive power is a form as
existing in corporeal matter. <em>And <strong>since</strong> such matter is the principle of individuality, <strong>therefore</strong> every power
of the sensitive part can only have knowledge of the individual.</em> There is another grade of cognitive power
which is neither the act of a corporeal organ, nor in any way connected with corporeal matter; such is the
angelic intellect, the object of whose cognitive power is <strong>therefore</strong> a form existing apart from matter: <strong>for</strong>
although angels know material things, yet they do not know them save in something immaterial, namely,
either in themselves or in God. But the human intellect holds a middle place: <strong>for</strong> it is not the act of an
organ; yet it is a power of the soul which is the form the body, as is clear from what we have said above
(Q76, A1). And <strong>therefore</strong> it is proper to it to know a form existing individually in corporeal matter, but not
as existing in this individual matter. But to know what is in individual matter, not as existing in such
matter, is to abstract the form from individual matter which is represented by the sense images. <strong>Therefore</strong>
we must needs say that our intellect understands material things by abstracting from the sense images; and
through material things <strong>thus</strong> considered we acquire some knowledge of immaterial things.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.85.2: [WHETHER INTELLECTUAL KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO IDEAS?]</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<em>ON THE CONTRARY</em>, The intelligible species is to the intellect what the sensible image is to the
sense. But the sensible image is not what is perceived, but rather that by which sense perceives. <strong>Therefore</strong>
the intelligible species is not <em>what</em> is actually understood, but that <em>by which</em> the intellect understands.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, Some have asserted that our intellectual faculties know only the impression made
on them; as, <strong>for</strong> example, that sense is cognizant only of the impression made on its own organ. According
to this theory, the intellect understands only its own impression, namely, the intelligible species which it has
received, so that this species is what is understood.

<p>	This is, however, manifestly false <strong>for</strong> <em>two reasons. First</em>, <strong>because</strong> the things we understand are the
objects of science; <strong>therefore</strong> if what we understand is merely the intelligible species in the soul, <strong>it would
follow</strong> that every science would not be concerned with objects outside the soul, but only with the intelligible
species within the soul; <strong>thus</strong>, according to the teaching of the Platonists all science is about ideas, which
they held to be actually understood [*Q84, A1]. 

<p>	<em>Secondly,</em> it is untrue, <strong>because</strong> it would lead to the opinion of the ancients who maintained that
"whatever seems, is true" [*Aristotle, Metaph. iii. 5], and that <strong>consequently</strong> contradictories are true
simultaneously. <strong>For</strong> if the faculty knows its own impression only, it can judge of that only. Now a thing
seems according to the impression made on the cognitive faculty. <strong>Consequently</strong> the cognitive faculty will
always judge of its own impression as such; and so every judgment will be true. . ..

<p>	<strong>Therefore</strong> it must be said that the intelligible species is related to the intellect as that by which it
understands <strong>. . . So since</strong> the intellect reflects upon itself, by such reflection it understands both its own act
of intelligence, and the species by which it understands. <strong>Thus</strong> the intelligible species is that which is
understood secondarily; but that which is primarily understood is the object, of which the species is the
likeness.
