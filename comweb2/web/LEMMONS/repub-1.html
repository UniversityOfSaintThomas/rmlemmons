<P><A NAME="start"></A><A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="11"></A>

<P>I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston,&nbsp;<A NAME="12"></A>that
I might offer up my prayers to the goddess; and also because I wanted&nbsp;<A NAME="13"></A>to
see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new&nbsp;<A NAME="14"></A>thing.
I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that&nbsp;<A NAME="15"></A>of
the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had finished&nbsp;<A NAME="16"></A>our
prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the&nbsp;<A NAME="17"></A>city;
and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch&nbsp;<A NAME="18"></A>sight
of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told&nbsp;<A NAME="19"></A>his
servant to run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me&nbsp;<A NAME="20"></A>by
the cloak behind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to&nbsp;<A NAME="21"></A>wait.&nbsp;<A NAME="22"></A>

<P>I turned round, and asked him where his master&nbsp;<A NAME="23"></A>was.&nbsp;<A NAME="24"></A>
<BR>There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only&nbsp;<A NAME="25"></A>wait.&nbsp;<A NAME="26"></A>

<P>Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus&nbsp;<A NAME="27"></A>appeared,
and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus the son&nbsp;<A NAME="28"></A>of
Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.&nbsp;<A NAME="29"></A>

<P>Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS&nbsp;<A NAME="30"></A>

<P>Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and our&nbsp;<A NAME="31"></A>companion
are already on your way to the city.&nbsp;<A NAME="32"></A>

<P>You are not far wrong, I said.&nbsp;<A NAME="33"></A>
<BR>But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?&nbsp;<A NAME="34"></A>
<BR>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="35"></A>
<BR>And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain&nbsp;<A NAME="36"></A>where
you are.&nbsp;<A NAME="37"></A>

<P>May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade&nbsp;<A NAME="38"></A>you
to let us go?&nbsp;<A NAME="39"></A>

<P>But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he&nbsp;<A NAME="40"></A>said.&nbsp;<A NAME="41"></A>
<BR>Certainly not, replied Glaucon.&nbsp;<A NAME="42"></A>
<BR>Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be&nbsp;<A NAME="43"></A>assured.&nbsp;<A NAME="44"></A>
<BR>Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback&nbsp;<A NAME="45"></A>in
honour of the goddess which will take place in the&nbsp;<A NAME="46"></A>evening?&nbsp;<A NAME="47"></A>

<P>With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry&nbsp;<A NAME="48"></A>torches
and pass them one to another during the race?&nbsp;<A NAME="49"></A>

<P>Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will he&nbsp;<A NAME="50"></A>celebrated
at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon&nbsp;<A NAME="51"></A>after
supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young&nbsp;<A NAME="52"></A>men,
and we will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be&nbsp;<A NAME="53"></A>perverse.&nbsp;<A NAME="54"></A>

<P>Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we&nbsp;<A NAME="55"></A>must.&nbsp;<A NAME="56"></A>
<BR>Very good, I replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="57"></A>

<P>Glaucon - CEPHALUS - SOCRATES&nbsp;<A NAME="58"></A>

<P>Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we&nbsp;<A NAME="59"></A>found
his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the&nbsp;<A NAME="60"></A>Chalcedonian,
Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of Aristonymus.&nbsp;<A NAME="61"></A>There
too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I had not seen for&nbsp;<A NAME="62"></A>a
long time, and I thought him very much aged. He was seated on a cushioned&nbsp;<A NAME="63"></A>chair,
and had a garland on his head, for he had been sacrificing in the&nbsp;<A NAME="64"></A>court;
and there were some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle,&nbsp;<A NAME="65"></A>upon
which we sat down by him. He saluted me eagerly, and then he said:&nbsp;<A NAME="66"></A>--&nbsp;<A NAME="67"></A>

<P>You don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I&nbsp;<A NAME="68"></A>were
still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But&nbsp;<A NAME="69"></A>at
my age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come oftener&nbsp;<A NAME="70"></A>to
the Piraeus. For let me tell you, that the more the pleasures of the&nbsp;<A NAME="71"></A>body
fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation.&nbsp;<A NAME="72"></A>Do
not then deny my request, but make our house your resort and keep company&nbsp;<A NAME="73"></A>with
these young men; we are old friends, and you will be quite at home&nbsp;<A NAME="74"></A>with
us.&nbsp;<A NAME="75"></A>

<P>I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus,&nbsp;<A NAME="76"></A>than
conversing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who have&nbsp;<A NAME="77"></A>gone
a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to enquire,&nbsp;<A NAME="78"></A>whether
the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And this is&nbsp;<A NAME="79"></A>a
question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time&nbsp;<A NAME="80"></A>which
the poets call the 'threshold of old age' --Is life harder towards&nbsp;<A NAME="81"></A>the
end, or what report do you give of it?&nbsp;<A NAME="82"></A>

<P>I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men&nbsp;<A NAME="83"></A>of
my age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb&nbsp;<A NAME="84"></A>says;
and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is --I cannot&nbsp;<A NAME="85"></A>eat,
I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away: there&nbsp;<A NAME="86"></A>was
a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer life.&nbsp;<A NAME="87"></A>Some
complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations, and&nbsp;<A NAME="88"></A>they
will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause.&nbsp;<A NAME="89"></A>But
to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which is not&nbsp;<A NAME="90"></A>really
in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old, and every&nbsp;<A NAME="91"></A>other
old man, would have felt as they do. But this is not my own experience,&nbsp;<A NAME="92"></A>nor
that of others whom I have known. How well I remember the aged poet&nbsp;<A NAME="93"></A>Sophocles,
when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age,&nbsp;<A NAME="94"></A>Sophocles,
--are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most gladly&nbsp;<A NAME="95"></A>have
I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped&nbsp;<A NAME="96"></A>from
a mad and furious master. His words have often occurred to my mind&nbsp;<A NAME="97"></A>since,
and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them.&nbsp;<A NAME="98"></A>For
certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions&nbsp;<A NAME="99"></A>relax
their hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp&nbsp;<A NAME="100"></A>not
of one mad master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these&nbsp;<A NAME="101"></A>regrets,
and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed&nbsp;<A NAME="102"></A>to
the same cause, which is not old age, but men's characters and tempers;&nbsp;<A NAME="103"></A>for
he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure&nbsp;<A NAME="104"></A>of
age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are&nbsp;<A NAME="105"></A>equally
a burden.&nbsp;<A NAME="106"></A>

<P>I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he&nbsp;<A NAME="107"></A>might
go on --Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in&nbsp;<A NAME="108"></A>general
are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old&nbsp;<A NAME="109"></A>age
sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but because&nbsp;<A NAME="110"></A>you
are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great&nbsp;<A NAME="111"></A>comforter.&nbsp;<A NAME="112"></A>

<P>You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is&nbsp;<A NAME="113"></A>something
in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I might&nbsp;<A NAME="114"></A>answer
them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him&nbsp;<A NAME="115"></A>and
saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but because he was&nbsp;<A NAME="116"></A>an
Athenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours, neither&nbsp;<A NAME="117"></A>of
us would have been famous.' And to those who are not rich and are impatient&nbsp;<A NAME="118"></A>of
old age, the same reply may be made; for to the good poor man old age&nbsp;<A NAME="119"></A>cannot
be a light burden, nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with&nbsp;<A NAME="120"></A>himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="121"></A>

<P>May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part&nbsp;<A NAME="122"></A>inherited
or acquired by you?&nbsp;<A NAME="123"></A>

<P>Acquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In&nbsp;<A NAME="124"></A>the
art of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather:&nbsp;<A NAME="125"></A>for
my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of&nbsp;<A NAME="126"></A>his
patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now; but&nbsp;<A NAME="127"></A>my
father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present: and&nbsp;<A NAME="128"></A>I
shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little&nbsp;<A NAME="129"></A>more
than I received.&nbsp;<A NAME="130"></A>

<P>That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see&nbsp;<A NAME="131"></A>that
you are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather&nbsp;<A NAME="132"></A>of
those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired&nbsp;<A NAME="133"></A>them;
the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation&nbsp;<A NAME="134"></A>of
their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems,&nbsp;<A NAME="135"></A>or
of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for the&nbsp;<A NAME="136"></A>sake
of use and profit which is common to them and all men. And hence they&nbsp;<A NAME="137"></A>are
very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but the praises of&nbsp;<A NAME="138"></A>wealth.
That is true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="139"></A>

<P>Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question? What do&nbsp;<A NAME="140"></A>you
consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your&nbsp;<A NAME="141"></A>wealth?&nbsp;<A NAME="142"></A>

<P>One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others.&nbsp;<A NAME="143"></A>For
let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near&nbsp;<A NAME="144"></A>death,
fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before; the&nbsp;<A NAME="145"></A>tales
of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds&nbsp;<A NAME="146"></A>done
here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he is tormented with&nbsp;<A NAME="147"></A>the
thought that they may be true: either from the weakness of age, or&nbsp;<A NAME="148"></A>because
he is now drawing nearer to that other place, he has a clearer&nbsp;<A NAME="149"></A>view
of these things; suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him, and&nbsp;<A NAME="150"></A>he
begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others. And&nbsp;<A NAME="151"></A>when
he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many&nbsp;<A NAME="152"></A>a
time like a child start up in his sleep for fear, and he is filled with&nbsp;<A NAME="153"></A>dark
forebodings. But to him who is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as&nbsp;<A NAME="154"></A>Pindar
charmingly says, is the kind nurse of his age:&nbsp;<A NAME="155"></A>

<P>Hope, he says, cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and&nbsp;<A NAME="156"></A>holiness
and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey;&nbsp;<A NAME="157"></A>--hope
which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of&nbsp;<A NAME="158"></A>man.&nbsp;<A NAME="159"></A>

<P>How admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches,&nbsp;<A NAME="160"></A>I
do not say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="161"></A>to
deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;&nbsp;<A NAME="162"></A>and
when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about&nbsp;<A NAME="163"></A>offerings
due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to this peace&nbsp;<A NAME="164"></A>of
mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and therefore I say,&nbsp;<A NAME="165"></A>that,
setting one thing against another, of the many advantages which wealth&nbsp;<A NAME="166"></A>has
to give, to a man of sense this is in my opinion the&nbsp;<A NAME="167"></A>greatest.&nbsp;<A NAME="168"></A>

<P>Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what&nbsp;<A NAME="169"></A>is
it? --to speak the truth and to pay your debts --no more than this?&nbsp;<A NAME="170"></A>And
even to this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in&nbsp;<A NAME="171"></A>his
right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he&nbsp;<A NAME="172"></A>is
not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him? No one would&nbsp;<A NAME="173"></A>say
that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than they&nbsp;<A NAME="174"></A>would
say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his&nbsp;<A NAME="175"></A>condition.&nbsp;<A NAME="176"></A>

<P>You are quite right, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="177"></A>
<BR>But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a&nbsp;<A NAME="178"></A>correct
definition of justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="179"></A>

<P>Cephalus - SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS&nbsp;<A NAME="180"></A>

<P>Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said Polemarchus&nbsp;<A NAME="181"></A>interposing.&nbsp;<A NAME="182"></A>

<P>I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after&nbsp;<A NAME="183"></A>the
sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the&nbsp;<A NAME="184"></A>company.&nbsp;<A NAME="185"></A>

<P>Is not Polemarchus your heir? I said.&nbsp;<A NAME="186"></A>
<BR>To be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the&nbsp;<A NAME="187"></A>sacrifices.&nbsp;<A NAME="188"></A>

<P>Socrates - POLEMARCHUS&nbsp;<A NAME="189"></A>

<P>Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say,&nbsp;<A NAME="190"></A>and
according to you truly say, about justice?&nbsp;<A NAME="191"></A>

<P>He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so&nbsp;<A NAME="192"></A>he
appears to me to be right.&nbsp;<A NAME="193"></A>

<P>I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired&nbsp;<A NAME="194"></A>man,
but his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear&nbsp;<A NAME="195"></A>to
me. For he certainly does not mean, as we were now saying that I ought&nbsp;<A NAME="196"></A>to
return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks&nbsp;<A NAME="197"></A>for
it when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be&nbsp;<A NAME="198"></A>denied
to be a debt.&nbsp;<A NAME="199"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="200"></A>
<BR>Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no&nbsp;<A NAME="201"></A>means
to make the return?&nbsp;<A NAME="202"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="203"></A>
<BR>When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did&nbsp;<A NAME="204"></A>not
mean to include that case?&nbsp;<A NAME="205"></A>

<P>Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good&nbsp;<A NAME="206"></A>to
a friend and never evil.&nbsp;<A NAME="207"></A>

<P>You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury&nbsp;<A NAME="208"></A>of
the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of&nbsp;<A NAME="209"></A>a
debt, --that is what you would imagine him to say?&nbsp;<A NAME="210"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="211"></A>
<BR>And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?&nbsp;<A NAME="212"></A>
<BR>To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an enemy,&nbsp;<A NAME="213"></A>as
I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him --that&nbsp;<A NAME="214"></A>is
to say, evil.&nbsp;<A NAME="215"></A>

<P>Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have&nbsp;<A NAME="216"></A>spoken
darkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that&nbsp;<A NAME="217"></A>justice
is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he termed&nbsp;<A NAME="218"></A>a
debt.&nbsp;<A NAME="219"></A>

<P>That must have been his meaning, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="220"></A>
<BR>By heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing&nbsp;<A NAME="221"></A>is
given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would&nbsp;<A NAME="222"></A>make
to us?&nbsp;<A NAME="223"></A>

<P>He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink&nbsp;<A NAME="224"></A>to
human bodies.&nbsp;<A NAME="225"></A>

<P>And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to&nbsp;<A NAME="226"></A>what?&nbsp;<A NAME="227"></A>
<BR>Seasoning to food.&nbsp;<A NAME="228"></A>
<BR>And what is that which justice gives, and to whom?&nbsp;<A NAME="229"></A>
<BR>If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding&nbsp;<A NAME="230"></A>instances,
then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil&nbsp;<A NAME="231"></A>to
enemies.&nbsp;<A NAME="232"></A>

<P>That is his meaning then?&nbsp;<A NAME="233"></A>
<BR>I think so.&nbsp;<A NAME="234"></A>
<BR>And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies&nbsp;<A NAME="235"></A>in
time of sickness?&nbsp;<A NAME="236"></A>

<P>The physician.&nbsp;<A NAME="237"></A>
<BR>Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the&nbsp;<A NAME="238"></A>sea?&nbsp;<A NAME="239"></A>
<BR>The pilot.&nbsp;<A NAME="240"></A>
<BR>And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just&nbsp;<A NAME="241"></A>man
most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his&nbsp;<A NAME="242"></A>friends?&nbsp;<A NAME="243"></A>

<P>In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the&nbsp;<A NAME="244"></A>other.&nbsp;<A NAME="245"></A>

<P>But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of&nbsp;<A NAME="246"></A>a
physician?&nbsp;<A NAME="247"></A>

<P>No.&nbsp;<A NAME="248"></A>
<BR>And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?&nbsp;<A NAME="249"></A>
<BR>No.&nbsp;<A NAME="250"></A>
<BR>Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?&nbsp;<A NAME="251"></A>
<BR>I am very far from thinking so.&nbsp;<A NAME="252"></A>
<BR>You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in&nbsp;<A NAME="253"></A>war?&nbsp;<A NAME="254"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="255"></A>
<BR>Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?&nbsp;<A NAME="256"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="257"></A>
<BR>Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes, --that is what you&nbsp;<A NAME="258"></A>mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="259"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="260"></A>
<BR>And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of&nbsp;<A NAME="261"></A>peace?&nbsp;<A NAME="262"></A>

<P>In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.&nbsp;<A NAME="263"></A>
<BR>And by contracts you mean partnerships?&nbsp;<A NAME="264"></A>
<BR>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="265"></A>
<BR>But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better&nbsp;<A NAME="266"></A>partner
at a game of draughts?&nbsp;<A NAME="267"></A>

<P>The skilful player.&nbsp;<A NAME="268"></A>
<BR>And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful&nbsp;<A NAME="269"></A>or
better partner than the builder?&nbsp;<A NAME="270"></A>

<P>Quite the reverse.&nbsp;<A NAME="271"></A>
<BR>Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than&nbsp;<A NAME="272"></A>the
harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a&nbsp;<A NAME="273"></A>better
partner than the just man?&nbsp;<A NAME="274"></A>

<P>In a money partnership.&nbsp;<A NAME="275"></A>
<BR>Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not&nbsp;<A NAME="276"></A>want
a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse;&nbsp;<A NAME="277"></A>a
man who is knowing about horses would be better for that, would he&nbsp;<A NAME="278"></A>not?&nbsp;<A NAME="279"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="280"></A>
<BR>And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would&nbsp;<A NAME="281"></A>be
better?&nbsp;<A NAME="282"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="283"></A>
<BR>Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man&nbsp;<A NAME="284"></A>is
to be preferred?&nbsp;<A NAME="285"></A>

<P>When you want a deposit to be kept safely.&nbsp;<A NAME="286"></A>
<BR>You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to&nbsp;<A NAME="287"></A>lie?&nbsp;<A NAME="288"></A>
<BR>Precisely.&nbsp;<A NAME="289"></A>
<BR>That is to say, justice is useful when money is&nbsp;<A NAME="290"></A>useless?&nbsp;<A NAME="291"></A>
<BR>That is the inference.&nbsp;<A NAME="292"></A>
<BR>And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful&nbsp;<A NAME="293"></A>to
the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then the&nbsp;<A NAME="294"></A>art
of the vine-dresser?&nbsp;<A NAME="295"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="296"></A>
<BR>And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them,&nbsp;<A NAME="297"></A>you
would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then&nbsp;<A NAME="298"></A>the
art of the soldier or of the musician?&nbsp;<A NAME="299"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="300"></A>
<BR>And so of all the other things; --justice is useful when they are useless,&nbsp;<A NAME="301"></A>and
useless when they are useful?&nbsp;<A NAME="302"></A>

<P>That is the inference.&nbsp;<A NAME="303"></A>
<BR>Then justice is not good for much. But let us consider this further&nbsp;<A NAME="304"></A>point:
Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any&nbsp;<A NAME="305"></A>kind
of fighting best able to ward off a blow?&nbsp;<A NAME="306"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="307"></A>
<BR>And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease&nbsp;<A NAME="308"></A>is
best able to create one?&nbsp;<A NAME="309"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="310"></A>
<BR>And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march&nbsp;<A NAME="311"></A>upon
the enemy?&nbsp;<A NAME="312"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="313"></A>
<BR>Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good&nbsp;<A NAME="314"></A>thief?&nbsp;<A NAME="315"></A>
<BR>That, I suppose, is to be inferred.&nbsp;<A NAME="316"></A>
<BR>Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing&nbsp;<A NAME="317"></A>it.&nbsp;<A NAME="318"></A>

<P>That is implied in the argument.&nbsp;<A NAME="319"></A>
<BR>Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this&nbsp;<A NAME="320"></A>is
a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; for he,&nbsp;<A NAME="321"></A>speaking
of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a favourite&nbsp;<A NAME="322"></A>of
his, affirms that&nbsp;<A NAME="323"></A>

<P>He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury. And so, you&nbsp;<A NAME="324"></A>and
Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft; to&nbsp;<A NAME="325"></A>be
practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies,'&nbsp;<A NAME="326"></A>--that
was what you were saying?&nbsp;<A NAME="327"></A>

<P>No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say;&nbsp;<A NAME="328"></A>but
I still stand by the latter words.&nbsp;<A NAME="329"></A>

<P>Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean&nbsp;<A NAME="330"></A>those
who are so really, or only in seeming?&nbsp;<A NAME="331"></A>

<P>Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks&nbsp;<A NAME="332"></A>good,
and to hate those whom he thinks evil.&nbsp;<A NAME="333"></A>

<P>Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who&nbsp;<A NAME="334"></A>are
not good seem to be so, and conversely?&nbsp;<A NAME="335"></A>

<P>That is true.&nbsp;<A NAME="336"></A>
<BR>Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends?&nbsp;<A NAME="337"></A>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="338"></A>

<P>And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and&nbsp;<A NAME="339"></A>evil
to the good?&nbsp;<A NAME="340"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="341"></A>
<BR>But the good are just and would not do an injustice?&nbsp;<A NAME="342"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="343"></A>
<BR>Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no&nbsp;<A NAME="344"></A>wrong?&nbsp;<A NAME="345"></A>

<P>Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.&nbsp;<A NAME="346"></A>
<BR>Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the&nbsp;<A NAME="347"></A>unjust?&nbsp;<A NAME="348"></A>

<P>I like that better.&nbsp;<A NAME="349"></A>
<BR>But see the consequence: --Many a man who is ignorant of human nature&nbsp;<A NAME="350"></A>has
friends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm to&nbsp;<A NAME="351"></A>them;
and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we&nbsp;<A NAME="352"></A>shall
be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the meaning&nbsp;<A NAME="353"></A>of
Simonides.&nbsp;<A NAME="354"></A>

<P>Very true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an error&nbsp;<A NAME="355"></A>into
which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and&nbsp;<A NAME="356"></A>'enemy.'&nbsp;<A NAME="357"></A>

<P>What was the error, Polemarchus? I asked.&nbsp;<A NAME="358"></A>
<BR>We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought&nbsp;<A NAME="359"></A>good.&nbsp;<A NAME="360"></A>

<P>And how is the error to be corrected?&nbsp;<A NAME="361"></A>
<BR>We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems,&nbsp;<A NAME="362"></A>good;
and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and&nbsp;<A NAME="363"></A>is
not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.&nbsp;<A NAME="364"></A>

<P>You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our&nbsp;<A NAME="365"></A>enemies?&nbsp;<A NAME="366"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="367"></A>
<BR>And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to&nbsp;<A NAME="368"></A>do
good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say:&nbsp;<A NAME="369"></A>It
is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our&nbsp;<A NAME="370"></A>enemies
when they are evil?&nbsp;<A NAME="371"></A>

<P>Yes, that appears to me to be the truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="372"></A>
<BR>But ought the just to injure any one at all?&nbsp;<A NAME="373"></A>
<BR>Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his&nbsp;<A NAME="374"></A>enemies.&nbsp;<A NAME="375"></A>

<P>When horses are injured, are they improved or&nbsp;<A NAME="376"></A>deteriorated?&nbsp;<A NAME="377"></A>
<BR>The latter.&nbsp;<A NAME="378"></A>
<BR>Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not&nbsp;<A NAME="379"></A>of
dogs?&nbsp;<A NAME="380"></A>

<P>Yes, of horses.&nbsp;<A NAME="381"></A>
<BR>And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of&nbsp;<A NAME="382"></A>horses?&nbsp;<A NAME="383"></A>

<P>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="384"></A>
<BR>And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the&nbsp;<A NAME="385"></A>proper
virtue of man?&nbsp;<A NAME="386"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="387"></A>
<BR>And that human virtue is justice?&nbsp;<A NAME="388"></A>
<BR>To be sure.&nbsp;<A NAME="389"></A>
<BR>Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?&nbsp;<A NAME="390"></A>
<BR>That is the result.&nbsp;<A NAME="391"></A>
<BR>But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?&nbsp;<A NAME="392"></A>
<BR>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="393"></A>
<BR>Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?&nbsp;<A NAME="394"></A>
<BR>Impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="395"></A>
<BR>And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can&nbsp;<A NAME="396"></A>the
good by virtue make them bad?&nbsp;<A NAME="397"></A>

<P>Assuredly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="398"></A>
<BR>Any more than heat can produce cold?&nbsp;<A NAME="399"></A>
<BR>It cannot.&nbsp;<A NAME="400"></A>
<BR>Or drought moisture?&nbsp;<A NAME="401"></A>
<BR>Clearly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="402"></A>
<BR>Nor can the good harm any one?&nbsp;<A NAME="403"></A>
<BR>Impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="404"></A>
<BR>And the just is the good?&nbsp;<A NAME="405"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="406"></A>
<BR>Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man,&nbsp;<A NAME="407"></A>but
of the opposite, who is the unjust?&nbsp;<A NAME="408"></A>

<P>I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.&nbsp;<A NAME="409"></A>
<BR>Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts,&nbsp;<A NAME="410"></A>and
that good is the debt which a man owes to his friends, and evil the&nbsp;<A NAME="411"></A>debt
which he owes to his enemies, --to say this is not wise; for it is&nbsp;<A NAME="412"></A>not
true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be&nbsp;<A NAME="413"></A>in
no case just.&nbsp;<A NAME="414"></A>

<P>I agree with you, said Polemarchus.&nbsp;<A NAME="415"></A>
<BR>Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes&nbsp;<A NAME="416"></A>such
a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other wise man or&nbsp;<A NAME="417"></A>seer?&nbsp;<A NAME="418"></A>

<P>I am quite ready to do battle at your side, he&nbsp;<A NAME="419"></A>said.&nbsp;<A NAME="420"></A>
<BR>Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?&nbsp;<A NAME="421"></A>
<BR>Whose?&nbsp;<A NAME="422"></A>
<BR>I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban,&nbsp;<A NAME="423"></A>or
some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own power,&nbsp;<A NAME="424"></A>was
the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends and harm&nbsp;<A NAME="425"></A>to
your enemies.'&nbsp;<A NAME="426"></A>

<P>Most true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="427"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what&nbsp;<A NAME="428"></A>other
can be offered?&nbsp;<A NAME="429"></A>

<P>Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had&nbsp;<A NAME="430"></A>made
an attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put&nbsp;<A NAME="431"></A>down
by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. But when Polemarchus&nbsp;<A NAME="432"></A>and
I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no longer hold&nbsp;<A NAME="433"></A>his
peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a wild beast,&nbsp;<A NAME="434"></A>seeking
to devour us. We were quite panic-stricken at the sight of&nbsp;<A NAME="435"></A>him.&nbsp;<A NAME="436"></A>

<P>Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS&nbsp;<A NAME="437"></A>

<P>He roared out to the whole company: What folly. Socrates, has taken&nbsp;<A NAME="438"></A>possession
of you all? And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one&nbsp;<A NAME="439"></A>another?
I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you should&nbsp;<A NAME="440"></A>not
only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to yourself from&nbsp;<A NAME="441"></A>the
refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many&nbsp;<A NAME="442"></A>a
one who can ask and cannot answer. And now I will not have you say that&nbsp;<A NAME="443"></A>justice
is duty or advantage or profit or gain or interest, for this sort&nbsp;<A NAME="444"></A>of
nonsense will not do for me; I must have clearness and&nbsp;<A NAME="445"></A>accuracy.&nbsp;<A NAME="446"></A>

<P>I was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without&nbsp;<A NAME="447"></A>trembling.
Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him, I&nbsp;<A NAME="448"></A>should
have been struck dumb: but when I saw his fury rising, I looked&nbsp;<A NAME="449"></A>at
him first, and was therefore able to reply to him.&nbsp;<A NAME="450"></A>

<P>Thrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don't be hard upon us. Polemarchus&nbsp;<A NAME="451"></A>and
I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but I can&nbsp;<A NAME="452"></A>assure
you that the error was not intentional. If we were seeking for a&nbsp;<A NAME="453"></A>piece
of gold, you would not imagine that we were 'knocking under to one&nbsp;<A NAME="454"></A>another,'
and so losing our chance of finding it. And why, when we are&nbsp;<A NAME="455"></A>seeking
for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of gold, do&nbsp;<A NAME="456"></A>you
say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our utmost&nbsp;<A NAME="457"></A>to
get at the truth? Nay, my good friend, we are most willing and anxious&nbsp;<A NAME="458"></A>to
do so, but the fact is that we cannot. And if so, you people who know&nbsp;<A NAME="459"></A>all
things should pity us and not be angry with us.&nbsp;<A NAME="460"></A>

<P>How characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh;&nbsp;<A NAME="461"></A>--that's
your ironical style! Did I not foresee --have I not already told&nbsp;<A NAME="462"></A>you,
that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony&nbsp;<A NAME="463"></A>or
any other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?&nbsp;<A NAME="464"></A>

<P>You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that&nbsp;<A NAME="465"></A>if
you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit&nbsp;<A NAME="466"></A>him
whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six&nbsp;<A NAME="467"></A>times
two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do&nbsp;<A NAME="468"></A>for
me,' --then obviously, that is your way of putting the question, no&nbsp;<A NAME="469"></A>one
can answer you. But suppose that he were to retort, 'Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<A NAME="470"></A>what
do you mean? If one of these numbers which you interdict be the true&nbsp;<A NAME="471"></A>answer
to the question, am I falsely to say some other number which is&nbsp;<A NAME="472"></A>not
the right one? --is that your meaning?' -How would you answer&nbsp;<A NAME="473"></A>him?&nbsp;<A NAME="474"></A>

<P>Just as if the two cases were at all alike! he&nbsp;<A NAME="475"></A>said.&nbsp;<A NAME="476"></A>
<BR>Why should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, but only&nbsp;<A NAME="477"></A>appear
to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he&nbsp;<A NAME="478"></A>thinks,
whether you and I forbid him or not?&nbsp;<A NAME="479"></A>

<P>I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted&nbsp;<A NAME="480"></A>answers?&nbsp;<A NAME="481"></A>

<P>I dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection&nbsp;<A NAME="482"></A>I
approve of any of them.&nbsp;<A NAME="483"></A>

<P>But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better,&nbsp;<A NAME="484"></A>he
said, than any of these? What do you deserve to have done to&nbsp;<A NAME="485"></A>you?&nbsp;<A NAME="486"></A>

<P>Done to me! --as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the wise&nbsp;<A NAME="487"></A>--that
is what I deserve to have done to me.&nbsp;<A NAME="488"></A>

<P>What, and no payment! a pleasant notion!&nbsp;<A NAME="489"></A>
<BR>I will pay when I have the money, I replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="490"></A>

<P>Socrates - THRASYMACHUS - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="491"></A>

<P>But you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, need&nbsp;<A NAME="492"></A>be
under no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for&nbsp;<A NAME="493"></A>Socrates.&nbsp;<A NAME="494"></A>

<P>Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does --refuse&nbsp;<A NAME="495"></A>to
answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one&nbsp;<A NAME="496"></A>else.&nbsp;<A NAME="497"></A>

<P>Why, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows,&nbsp;<A NAME="498"></A>and
says that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint&nbsp;<A NAME="499"></A>notions
of his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them? The&nbsp;<A NAME="500"></A>natural
thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself who&nbsp;<A NAME="501"></A>professes
to know and can tell what he knows. Will you then kindly answer,&nbsp;<A NAME="502"></A>for
the edification of the company and of myself ?&nbsp;<A NAME="503"></A>

<P>Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<A NAME="504"></A>as
any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he thought that&nbsp;<A NAME="505"></A>he
had an excellent answer, and would distinguish himself. But at first&nbsp;<A NAME="506"></A>he
to insist on my answering; at length he consented to begin. Behold,&nbsp;<A NAME="507"></A>he
said, the wisdom of Socrates; he refuses to teach himself, and goes&nbsp;<A NAME="508"></A>about
learning of others, to whom he never even says thank&nbsp;<A NAME="509"></A>you.&nbsp;<A NAME="510"></A>

<P>That I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am&nbsp;<A NAME="511"></A>ungrateful
I wholly deny. Money I have none, and therefore I pay in praise,&nbsp;<A NAME="512"></A>which
is all I have: and how ready I am to praise any one who appears to&nbsp;<A NAME="513"></A>me
to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer; for I expect&nbsp;<A NAME="514"></A>that
you will answer well.&nbsp;<A NAME="515"></A>

<P>Listen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else&nbsp;<A NAME="516"></A>than
the interest of the stronger. And now why do you not me? But of course&nbsp;<A NAME="517"></A>you
won't.&nbsp;<A NAME="518"></A>

<P>Let me first understand you, I replied. justice, as you say, is&nbsp;<A NAME="519"></A>the
interest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?&nbsp;<A NAME="520"></A>You
cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is stronger&nbsp;<A NAME="521"></A>than
we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength,&nbsp;<A NAME="522"></A>that
to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than&nbsp;<A NAME="523"></A>he
is, and right and just for us?&nbsp;<A NAME="524"></A>

<P>That's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense&nbsp;<A NAME="525"></A>which
is most damaging to the argument.&nbsp;<A NAME="526"></A>

<P>Not at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them;&nbsp;<A NAME="527"></A>and
I wish that you would be a little clearer.&nbsp;<A NAME="528"></A>

<P>Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ;&nbsp;<A NAME="529"></A>there
are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are&nbsp;<A NAME="530"></A>aristocracies?&nbsp;<A NAME="531"></A>

<P>Yes, I know.&nbsp;<A NAME="532"></A>
<BR>And the government is the ruling power in each state?&nbsp;<A NAME="533"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="534"></A>
<BR>And the different forms of government make laws democratical, aristocratical,&nbsp;<A NAME="535"></A>tyrannical,
with a view to their several interests; and these laws, which&nbsp;<A NAME="536"></A>are
made by them for their own interests, are the justice which they deliver&nbsp;<A NAME="537"></A>to
their subjects, and him who transgresses them they punish as a breaker&nbsp;<A NAME="538"></A>of
the law, and unjust. And that is what I mean when I say that in all&nbsp;<A NAME="539"></A>states
there is the same principle of justice, which is the interest of&nbsp;<A NAME="540"></A>the
government; and as the government must be supposed to have power, the&nbsp;<A NAME="541"></A>only
reasonable conclusion is, that everywhere there is one principle of&nbsp;<A NAME="542"></A>justice,
which is the interest of the stronger.&nbsp;<A NAME="543"></A>

<P>Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not&nbsp;<A NAME="544"></A>I
will try to discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you&nbsp;<A NAME="545"></A>have
yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. It&nbsp;<A NAME="546"></A>is
true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are&nbsp;<A NAME="547"></A>added.&nbsp;<A NAME="548"></A>

<P>A small addition, you must allow, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="549"></A>
<BR>Great or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether&nbsp;<A NAME="550"></A>what
you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice is&nbsp;<A NAME="551"></A>interest
of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger'; about this&nbsp;<A NAME="552"></A>addition
I am not so sure, and must therefore consider&nbsp;<A NAME="553"></A>further.&nbsp;<A NAME="554"></A>

<P>Proceed.&nbsp;<A NAME="555"></A>
<BR>I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just or subjects&nbsp;<A NAME="556"></A>to
obey their rulers?&nbsp;<A NAME="557"></A>

<P>I do.&nbsp;<A NAME="558"></A>
<BR>But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they sometimes&nbsp;<A NAME="559"></A>liable
to err?&nbsp;<A NAME="560"></A>

<P>To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.&nbsp;<A NAME="561"></A>
<BR>Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and&nbsp;<A NAME="562"></A>sometimes
not?&nbsp;<A NAME="563"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="564"></A>
<BR>When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest;&nbsp;<A NAME="565"></A>when
they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit&nbsp;<A NAME="566"></A>that?&nbsp;<A NAME="567"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="568"></A>
<BR>And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects, --and&nbsp;<A NAME="569"></A>that
is what you call justice?&nbsp;<A NAME="570"></A>

<P>Doubtless.&nbsp;<A NAME="571"></A>
<BR>Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to&nbsp;<A NAME="572"></A>the
interest of the stronger but the reverse?&nbsp;<A NAME="573"></A>

<P>What is that you are saying? he asked.&nbsp;<A NAME="574"></A>
<BR>I am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us consider:&nbsp;<A NAME="575"></A>Have
we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest&nbsp;<A NAME="576"></A>in
what they command, and also that to obey them is justice? Has not that&nbsp;<A NAME="577"></A>been
admitted?&nbsp;<A NAME="578"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="579"></A>
<BR>Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest&nbsp;<A NAME="580"></A>of
the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be done&nbsp;<A NAME="581"></A>which
are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice is the obedience&nbsp;<A NAME="582"></A>which
the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O wisest of&nbsp;<A NAME="583"></A>men,
is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded&nbsp;<A NAME="584"></A>to
do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the injury of the&nbsp;<A NAME="585"></A>stronger?&nbsp;<A NAME="586"></A>

<P>Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.&nbsp;<A NAME="587"></A>

<P>Socrates - CLEITOPHON - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS&nbsp;<A NAME="588"></A>

<P>Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his&nbsp;<A NAME="589"></A>witness.&nbsp;<A NAME="590"></A>

<P>But there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus&nbsp;<A NAME="591"></A>himself
acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for&nbsp;<A NAME="592"></A>their
own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is&nbsp;<A NAME="593"></A>justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="594"></A>

<P>Yes, Polemarchus, --Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what&nbsp;<A NAME="595"></A>was
commanded by their rulers is just.&nbsp;<A NAME="596"></A>

<P>Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest&nbsp;<A NAME="597"></A>of
the stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further&nbsp;<A NAME="598"></A>acknowledged
that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects&nbsp;<A NAME="599"></A>to
do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that justice is&nbsp;<A NAME="600"></A>the
injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.&nbsp;<A NAME="601"></A>

<P>But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger&nbsp;<A NAME="602"></A>what
the stronger thought to be his interest, --this was what the weaker&nbsp;<A NAME="603"></A>had
to do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="604"></A>

<P>Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.&nbsp;<A NAME="605"></A>

<P>Socrates - THRASYMACHUS&nbsp;<A NAME="606"></A>

<P>Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept&nbsp;<A NAME="607"></A>his
statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what&nbsp;<A NAME="608"></A>the
stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or&nbsp;<A NAME="609"></A>not?&nbsp;<A NAME="610"></A>

<P>Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken&nbsp;<A NAME="611"></A>the
stronger at the time when he is mistaken?&nbsp;<A NAME="612"></A>

<P>Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted&nbsp;<A NAME="613"></A>that
the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes&nbsp;<A NAME="614"></A>mistaken.&nbsp;<A NAME="615"></A>

<P>You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example,&nbsp;<A NAME="616"></A>that
he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?&nbsp;<A NAME="617"></A>or
that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian&nbsp;<A NAME="618"></A>at
the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake? True,&nbsp;<A NAME="619"></A>we
say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake,&nbsp;<A NAME="620"></A>but
this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is that neither the grammarian&nbsp;<A NAME="621"></A>nor
any other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what&nbsp;<A NAME="622"></A>his
name implies; they none of them err unless their skill fails them,&nbsp;<A NAME="623"></A>and
then they cease to be skilled artists. No artist or sage or ruler errs&nbsp;<A NAME="624"></A>at
the time when he is what his name implies; though he is commonly said&nbsp;<A NAME="625"></A>to
err, and I adopted the common mode of speaking. But to be perfectly&nbsp;<A NAME="626"></A>accurate,
since you are such a lover of accuracy, we should say that the&nbsp;<A NAME="627"></A>ruler,
in so far as he is the ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring,&nbsp;<A NAME="628"></A>always
commands that which is for his own interest; and the subject is&nbsp;<A NAME="629"></A>required
to execute his commands; and therefore, as I said at first and&nbsp;<A NAME="630"></A>now
repeat, justice is the interest of the stronger.&nbsp;<A NAME="631"></A>

<P>Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like&nbsp;<A NAME="632"></A>an
informer?&nbsp;<A NAME="633"></A>

<P>Certainly, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="634"></A>
<BR>And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring&nbsp;<A NAME="635"></A>you
in the argument?&nbsp;<A NAME="636"></A>

<P>Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word --I know it; but you&nbsp;<A NAME="637"></A>will
be found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never&nbsp;<A NAME="638"></A>prevail.&nbsp;<A NAME="639"></A>

<P>I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any misunderstanding&nbsp;<A NAME="640"></A>occurring
between us in future, let me ask, in what sense do you speak&nbsp;<A NAME="641"></A>of
a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were saying, he being the&nbsp;<A NAME="642"></A>superior,
it is just that the inferior should execute --is he a ruler in&nbsp;<A NAME="643"></A>the
popular or in the strict sense of the term?&nbsp;<A NAME="644"></A>

<P>In the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play&nbsp;<A NAME="645"></A>the
informer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never&nbsp;<A NAME="646"></A>will
be able, never.&nbsp;<A NAME="647"></A>

<P>And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and&nbsp;<A NAME="648"></A>cheat,
Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.&nbsp;<A NAME="649"></A>

<P>Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you&nbsp;<A NAME="650"></A>failed.&nbsp;<A NAME="651"></A>
<BR>Enough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should&nbsp;<A NAME="652"></A>ask
you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which&nbsp;<A NAME="653"></A>you
are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? And remember&nbsp;<A NAME="654"></A>that
I am now speaking of the true physician.&nbsp;<A NAME="655"></A>

<P>A healer of the sick, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="656"></A>
<BR>And the pilot --that is to say, the true pilot --is he a captain of&nbsp;<A NAME="657"></A>sailors
or a mere sailor?&nbsp;<A NAME="658"></A>

<P>A captain of sailors.&nbsp;<A NAME="659"></A>
<BR>The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into&nbsp;<A NAME="660"></A>account;
neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which he&nbsp;<A NAME="661"></A>is
distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant of&nbsp;<A NAME="662"></A>his
skill and of his authority over the sailors.&nbsp;<A NAME="663"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="664"></A>
<BR>Now, I said, every art has an interest?&nbsp;<A NAME="665"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="666"></A>
<BR>For which the art has to consider and provide?&nbsp;<A NAME="667"></A>
<BR>Yes, that is the aim of art.&nbsp;<A NAME="668"></A>
<BR>And the interest of any art is the perfection of it --this and nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="669"></A>else?&nbsp;<A NAME="670"></A>

<P>What do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="671"></A>
<BR>I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.&nbsp;<A NAME="672"></A>Suppose
you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has wants,&nbsp;<A NAME="673"></A>I
should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body may be ill and&nbsp;<A NAME="674"></A>require
to be cured, and has therefore interests to which the art of medicine&nbsp;<A NAME="675"></A>ministers;
and this is the origin and intention of medicine, as you will&nbsp;<A NAME="676"></A>acknowledge.
Am I not right?&nbsp;<A NAME="677"></A>

<P>Quite right, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="678"></A>
<BR>But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in&nbsp;<A NAME="679"></A>any
quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the&nbsp;<A NAME="680"></A>ear
fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for&nbsp;<A NAME="681"></A>the
interests of seeing and hearing --has art in itself, I say, any similar&nbsp;<A NAME="682"></A>liability
to fault or defect, and does every art require another supplementary&nbsp;<A NAME="683"></A>art
to provide for its interests, and that another and another without&nbsp;<A NAME="684"></A>end?
Or have the arts to look only after their own interests? Or have they&nbsp;<A NAME="685"></A>no
need either of themselves or of another? --having no faults or defects,&nbsp;<A NAME="686"></A>they
have no need to correct them, either by the exercise of their own&nbsp;<A NAME="687"></A>art
or of any other; they have only to consider the interest of their subject-matter.&nbsp;<A NAME="688"></A>For
every art remains pure and faultless while remaining true --that is&nbsp;<A NAME="689"></A>to
say, while perfect and unimpaired. Take the words in your precise sense,&nbsp;<A NAME="690"></A>and
tell me whether I am not right."&nbsp;<A NAME="691"></A>

<P>Yes, clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="692"></A>
<BR>Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the interest&nbsp;<A NAME="693"></A>of
the body?&nbsp;<A NAME="694"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="695"></A>
<BR>Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art&nbsp;<A NAME="696"></A>of
horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts&nbsp;<A NAME="697"></A>care
for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that which&nbsp;<A NAME="698"></A>is
the subject of their art?&nbsp;<A NAME="699"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="700"></A>
<BR>But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of&nbsp;<A NAME="701"></A>their
own subjects?&nbsp;<A NAME="702"></A>

<P>To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.&nbsp;<A NAME="703"></A>
<BR>Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of&nbsp;<A NAME="704"></A>the
stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and&nbsp;<A NAME="705"></A>weaker?&nbsp;<A NAME="706"></A>

<P>He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally&nbsp;<A NAME="707"></A>acquiesced.&nbsp;<A NAME="708"></A>

<P>Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician,&nbsp;<A NAME="709"></A>considers
his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient;&nbsp;<A NAME="710"></A>for
the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject,&nbsp;<A NAME="711"></A>and
is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?&nbsp;<A NAME="712"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="713"></A>
<BR>And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler&nbsp;<A NAME="714"></A>of
sailors and not a mere sailor?&nbsp;<A NAME="715"></A>

<P>That has been admitted.&nbsp;<A NAME="716"></A>
<BR>And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest&nbsp;<A NAME="717"></A>of
the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's&nbsp;<A NAME="718"></A>interest?&nbsp;<A NAME="719"></A>

<P>He gave a reluctant 'Yes.'&nbsp;<A NAME="720"></A>
<BR>Then, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so&nbsp;<A NAME="721"></A>far
as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest,&nbsp;<A NAME="722"></A>but
always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art;&nbsp;<A NAME="723"></A>to
that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which he says&nbsp;<A NAME="724"></A>and
does.&nbsp;<A NAME="725"></A>

<P>When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw&nbsp;<A NAME="726"></A>that
the definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<A NAME="727"></A>instead
of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a&nbsp;<A NAME="728"></A>nurse?&nbsp;<A NAME="729"></A>

<P>Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to&nbsp;<A NAME="730"></A>be
answering?&nbsp;<A NAME="731"></A>

<P>Because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she&nbsp;<A NAME="732"></A>has
not even taught you to know the shepherd from the&nbsp;<A NAME="733"></A>sheep.&nbsp;<A NAME="734"></A>

<P>What makes you say that? I replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="735"></A>
<BR>Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the&nbsp;<A NAME="736"></A>sheep
or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself&nbsp;<A NAME="737"></A>or
his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of states, if they&nbsp;<A NAME="738"></A>are
true rulers, never think of their subjects as sheep, and that they&nbsp;<A NAME="739"></A>are
not studying their own advantage day and night. Oh, no; and so entirely&nbsp;<A NAME="740"></A>astray
are you in your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know&nbsp;<A NAME="741"></A>that
justice and the just are in reality another's good; that is to say,&nbsp;<A NAME="742"></A>the
interest of the ruler and stronger, and the loss of the subject and&nbsp;<A NAME="743"></A>servant;
and injustice the opposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly&nbsp;<A NAME="744"></A>simple
and just: he is the stronger, and his subjects do what is for his&nbsp;<A NAME="745"></A>interest,
and minister to his happiness, which is very far from being their&nbsp;<A NAME="746"></A>own.
Consider further, most foolish Socrates, that the just is always a&nbsp;<A NAME="747"></A>loser
in comparison with the unjust. First of all, in private contracts:&nbsp;<A NAME="748"></A>wherever
the unjust is the partner of the just you will find that, when&nbsp;<A NAME="749"></A>the
partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has always more and the just&nbsp;<A NAME="750"></A>less.
Secondly, in their dealings with the State: when there is an income&nbsp;<A NAME="751"></A>tax,
the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount&nbsp;<A NAME="752"></A>of
income; and when there is anything to be received the one gains nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="753"></A>and
the other much. Observe also what happens when they take an office;&nbsp;<A NAME="754"></A>there
is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other&nbsp;<A NAME="755"></A>losses,
and getting nothing out of the public, because he is just; moreover&nbsp;<A NAME="756"></A>he
is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them&nbsp;<A NAME="757"></A>in
unlawful ways. But all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man.&nbsp;<A NAME="758"></A>I
am speaking, as before, of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage&nbsp;<A NAME="759"></A>of
the unjust is more apparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen&nbsp;<A NAME="760"></A>if
we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the criminal is the&nbsp;<A NAME="761"></A>happiest
of men, and the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="762"></A>are
the most miserable --that is to say tyranny, which by fraud and force&nbsp;<A NAME="763"></A>takes
away the property of others, not little by little but wholesale;&nbsp;<A NAME="764"></A>comprehending
in one, things sacred as well as profane, private and public;&nbsp;<A NAME="765"></A>for
which acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating any one of them&nbsp;<A NAME="766"></A>singly,
he would be punished and incur great disgrace --they who do such&nbsp;<A NAME="767"></A>wrong
in particular cases are called robbers of temples, and man-stealers&nbsp;<A NAME="768"></A>and
burglars and swindlers and thieves. But when a man besides taking away&nbsp;<A NAME="769"></A>the
money of the citizens has made slaves of them, then, instead of these&nbsp;<A NAME="770"></A>names
of reproach, he is termed happy and blessed, not only by the citizens&nbsp;<A NAME="771"></A>but
by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice.&nbsp;<A NAME="772"></A>For
mankind censure injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of&nbsp;<A NAME="773"></A>it
and not because they shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have&nbsp;<A NAME="774"></A>shown,
Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more strength&nbsp;<A NAME="775"></A>and
freedom and mastery than justice; and, as I said at first, justice&nbsp;<A NAME="776"></A>is
the interest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit&nbsp;<A NAME="777"></A>and
interest.&nbsp;<A NAME="778"></A>

<P>Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bathman,&nbsp;<A NAME="779"></A>deluged
our ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company&nbsp;<A NAME="780"></A>would
not let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his position;&nbsp;<A NAME="781"></A>and
I myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us. Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<A NAME="782"></A>I
said to him, excellent man, how suggestive are your remarks! And are&nbsp;<A NAME="783"></A>you
going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether&nbsp;<A NAME="784"></A>they
are true or not? Is the attempt to determine the way of man's life&nbsp;<A NAME="785"></A>so
small a matter in your eyes --to determine how life may be passed by&nbsp;<A NAME="786"></A>each
one of us to the greatest advantage?&nbsp;<A NAME="787"></A>

<P>And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the&nbsp;<A NAME="788"></A>enquiry?&nbsp;<A NAME="789"></A>

<P>You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about&nbsp;<A NAME="790"></A>us,
Thrasymachus --whether we live better or worse from not knowing what&nbsp;<A NAME="791"></A>you
say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. Prithee, friend,&nbsp;<A NAME="792"></A>do
not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any benefit&nbsp;<A NAME="793"></A>which
you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own part I openly&nbsp;<A NAME="794"></A>declare
that I am not convinced, and that I do not believe injustice to&nbsp;<A NAME="795"></A>be
more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled and allowed to have&nbsp;<A NAME="796"></A>free
play. For, granting that there may be an unjust man who is able to&nbsp;<A NAME="797"></A>commit
injustice either by fraud or force, still this does not convince&nbsp;<A NAME="798"></A>me
of the superior advantage of injustice, and there may be others who&nbsp;<A NAME="799"></A>are
in the same predicament with myself. Perhaps we may be wrong; if so,&nbsp;<A NAME="800"></A>you
in your wisdom should convince us that we are mistaken in preferring&nbsp;<A NAME="801"></A>justice
to injustice.&nbsp;<A NAME="802"></A>

<P>And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced&nbsp;<A NAME="803"></A>by
what I have just said; what more can I do for you? Would you have me&nbsp;<A NAME="804"></A>put
the proof bodily into your souls?&nbsp;<A NAME="805"></A>

<P>Heaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or,&nbsp;<A NAME="806"></A>if
you change, change openly and let there be no deception. For I must&nbsp;<A NAME="807"></A>remark,
Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that&nbsp;<A NAME="808"></A>although
you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you&nbsp;<A NAME="809"></A>did
not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought&nbsp;<A NAME="810"></A>that
the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their&nbsp;<A NAME="811"></A>own
good, but like a mere diner or banqueter with a view to the pleasures&nbsp;<A NAME="812"></A>of
the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the market, and not as&nbsp;<A NAME="813"></A>a
shepherd. Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the&nbsp;<A NAME="814"></A>good
of his subjects; he has only to provide the best for them, since the&nbsp;<A NAME="815"></A>perfection
of the art is already ensured whenever all the requirements&nbsp;<A NAME="816"></A>of
it are satisfied. And that was what I was saying just now about the&nbsp;<A NAME="817"></A>ruler.
I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered as ruler, whether&nbsp;<A NAME="818"></A>in
a state or in private life, could only regard the good of his flock&nbsp;<A NAME="819"></A>or
subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states, that&nbsp;<A NAME="820"></A>is
to say, the true rulers, like being in authority.&nbsp;<A NAME="821"></A>

<P>Think! Nay, I am sure of it.&nbsp;<A NAME="822"></A>
<BR>Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly&nbsp;<A NAME="823"></A>without
payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the advantage&nbsp;<A NAME="824"></A>not
of themselves but of others? Let me ask you a question: Are not the&nbsp;<A NAME="825"></A>several
arts different, by reason of their each having a separate function?&nbsp;<A NAME="826"></A>And,
my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we may make&nbsp;<A NAME="827"></A>a
little progress.&nbsp;<A NAME="828"></A>

<P>Yes, that is the difference, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="829"></A>
<BR>And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one&nbsp;<A NAME="830"></A>--medicine,
for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea, and&nbsp;<A NAME="831"></A>so
on?&nbsp;<A NAME="832"></A>

<P>Yes, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="833"></A>
<BR>And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but&nbsp;<A NAME="834"></A>we
do not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot&nbsp;<A NAME="835"></A>is
to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the pilot&nbsp;<A NAME="836"></A>may
be improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined to say, would&nbsp;<A NAME="837"></A>you,
that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt&nbsp;<A NAME="838"></A>your
exact use of language?&nbsp;<A NAME="839"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="840"></A>
<BR>Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not&nbsp;<A NAME="841"></A>say
that the art of payment is medicine?&nbsp;<A NAME="842"></A>

<P>I should say not.&nbsp;<A NAME="843"></A>
<BR>Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because&nbsp;<A NAME="844"></A>a
man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?&nbsp;<A NAME="845"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="846"></A>
<BR>And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially&nbsp;<A NAME="847"></A>confined
to the art?&nbsp;<A NAME="848"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="849"></A>
<BR>Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is&nbsp;<A NAME="850"></A>to
be attributed to something of which they all have the common&nbsp;<A NAME="851"></A>use?&nbsp;<A NAME="852"></A>

<P>True, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="853"></A>
<BR>And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is&nbsp;<A NAME="854"></A>gained
by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art professed&nbsp;<A NAME="855"></A>by
him?&nbsp;<A NAME="856"></A>

<P>He gave a reluctant assent to this.&nbsp;<A NAME="857"></A>
<BR>Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective&nbsp;<A NAME="858"></A>arts.
But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives health, and&nbsp;<A NAME="859"></A>the
art of the builder builds a house, another art attends them which is&nbsp;<A NAME="860"></A>the
art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting&nbsp;<A NAME="861"></A>that
over which they preside, but would the artist receive any benefit&nbsp;<A NAME="862"></A>from
his art unless he were paid as well?&nbsp;<A NAME="863"></A>

<P>I suppose not.&nbsp;<A NAME="864"></A>
<BR>But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for&nbsp;<A NAME="865"></A>nothing?&nbsp;<A NAME="866"></A>
<BR>Certainly, he confers a benefit.&nbsp;<A NAME="867"></A>
<BR>Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts&nbsp;<A NAME="868"></A>nor
governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before&nbsp;<A NAME="869"></A>saying,
they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are&nbsp;<A NAME="870"></A>the
weaker and not the stronger --to their good they attend and not to&nbsp;<A NAME="871"></A>the
good of the superior.&nbsp;<A NAME="872"></A>

<P>And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus, why, as I was just&nbsp;<A NAME="873"></A>now
saying, no one is willing to govern; because no one likes to take in&nbsp;<A NAME="874"></A>hand
the reformation of evils which are not his concern without remuneration.&nbsp;<A NAME="875"></A>For,
in the execution of his work, and in giving his orders to another,&nbsp;<A NAME="876"></A>the
true artist does not regard his own interest, but always that of his&nbsp;<A NAME="877"></A>subjects;
and therefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they&nbsp;<A NAME="878"></A>must
be paid in one of three modes of payment: money, or honour, or a penalty&nbsp;<A NAME="879"></A>for
refusing.&nbsp;<A NAME="880"></A>

<P>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="881"></A>

<P>What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of&nbsp;<A NAME="882"></A>payment
are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not understand,&nbsp;<A NAME="883"></A>or
how a penalty can be a payment.&nbsp;<A NAME="884"></A>

<P>You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment&nbsp;<A NAME="885"></A>which
to the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know&nbsp;<A NAME="886"></A>that
ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a&nbsp;<A NAME="887"></A>disgrace?&nbsp;<A NAME="888"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="889"></A>
<BR>And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for&nbsp;<A NAME="890"></A>them;
good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing&nbsp;<A NAME="891"></A>and
so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="892"></A>out
of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being ambitious&nbsp;<A NAME="893"></A>they
do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them,&nbsp;<A NAME="894"></A>and
they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment. And this,&nbsp;<A NAME="895"></A>as
I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness to take office, instead&nbsp;<A NAME="896"></A>of
waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst&nbsp;<A NAME="897"></A>part
of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled&nbsp;<A NAME="898"></A>by
one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive,&nbsp;<A NAME="899"></A>induces
the good to take office, not because they would, but because they&nbsp;<A NAME="900"></A>cannot
help --not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit&nbsp;<A NAME="901"></A>or
enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because they are not able&nbsp;<A NAME="902"></A>to
commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves,&nbsp;<A NAME="903"></A>or
indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a city were composed&nbsp;<A NAME="904"></A>entirely
of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of&nbsp;<A NAME="905"></A>contention
as to obtain office is at present; then we should have plain&nbsp;<A NAME="906"></A>proof
that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest,&nbsp;<A NAME="907"></A>but
that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather&nbsp;<A NAME="908"></A>to
receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring&nbsp;<A NAME="909"></A>one.
So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the interest&nbsp;<A NAME="910"></A>of
the stronger. This latter question need not be further discussed at&nbsp;<A NAME="911"></A>present;
but when Thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more&nbsp;<A NAME="912"></A>advantageous
than that of the just, his new statement appears to me to&nbsp;<A NAME="913"></A>be
of a far more serious character. Which of us has spoken truly? And which&nbsp;<A NAME="914"></A>sort
of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?&nbsp;<A NAME="915"></A>

<P>I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous,&nbsp;<A NAME="916"></A>he
answered.&nbsp;<A NAME="917"></A>

<P>Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus&nbsp;<A NAME="918"></A>was
rehearsing?&nbsp;<A NAME="919"></A>

<P>Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced&nbsp;<A NAME="920"></A>me.&nbsp;<A NAME="921"></A>
<BR>Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that&nbsp;<A NAME="922"></A>he
is saying what is not true?&nbsp;<A NAME="923"></A>

<P>Most certainly, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="924"></A>
<BR>If, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all&nbsp;<A NAME="925"></A>the
advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must&nbsp;<A NAME="926"></A>be
a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side,&nbsp;<A NAME="927"></A>and
in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed in our&nbsp;<A NAME="928"></A>enquiry
as we lately did, by making admissions to one another, we shall&nbsp;<A NAME="929"></A>unite
the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.&nbsp;<A NAME="930"></A>

<P>Very good, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="931"></A>
<BR>And which method do I understand you to prefer? I&nbsp;<A NAME="932"></A>said.&nbsp;<A NAME="933"></A>
<BR>That which you propose.&nbsp;<A NAME="934"></A>
<BR>Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning&nbsp;<A NAME="935"></A>and
answer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect&nbsp;<A NAME="936"></A>justice?&nbsp;<A NAME="937"></A>

<P>Socrates - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS&nbsp;<A NAME="938"></A>

<P>Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my&nbsp;<A NAME="939"></A>reasons.&nbsp;<A NAME="940"></A>
<BR>And what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="941"></A>and
the other vice?&nbsp;<A NAME="942"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="943"></A>
<BR>I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="944"></A>vice?&nbsp;<A NAME="945"></A>
<BR>What a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="946"></A>to
be profitable and justice not.&nbsp;<A NAME="947"></A>

<P>What else then would you say?&nbsp;<A NAME="948"></A>
<BR>The opposite, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="949"></A>
<BR>And would you call justice vice?&nbsp;<A NAME="950"></A>
<BR>No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.&nbsp;<A NAME="951"></A>
<BR>Then would you call injustice malignity?&nbsp;<A NAME="952"></A>
<BR>No; I would rather say discretion.&nbsp;<A NAME="953"></A>
<BR>And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?&nbsp;<A NAME="954"></A>
<BR>Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly&nbsp;<A NAME="955"></A>unjust,
and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but perhaps&nbsp;<A NAME="956"></A>you
imagine me to be talking of cutpurses.&nbsp;<A NAME="957"></A>

<P>Even this profession if undetected has advantages, though they&nbsp;<A NAME="958"></A>are
not to be compared with those of which I was just now&nbsp;<A NAME="959"></A>speaking.&nbsp;<A NAME="960"></A>

<P>I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<A NAME="961"></A>I
replied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="962"></A>with
wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.&nbsp;<A NAME="963"></A>

<P>Certainly I do so class them.&nbsp;<A NAME="964"></A>
<BR>Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground;&nbsp;<A NAME="965"></A>for
if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had been&nbsp;<A NAME="966"></A>admitted
by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer might&nbsp;<A NAME="967"></A>have
been given to you on received principles; but now I perceive that&nbsp;<A NAME="968"></A>you
will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust you will&nbsp;<A NAME="969"></A>attribute
all the qualities which were attributed by us before to the just,&nbsp;<A NAME="970"></A>seeing
that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and&nbsp;<A NAME="971"></A>virtue.&nbsp;<A NAME="972"></A>

<P>You have guessed most infallibly, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="973"></A>
<BR>Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument&nbsp;<A NAME="974"></A>so
long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are speaking&nbsp;<A NAME="975"></A>your
real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are not&nbsp;<A NAME="976"></A>amusing
yourself at our expense.&nbsp;<A NAME="977"></A>

<P>I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you? --to refute&nbsp;<A NAME="978"></A>the
argument is your business.&nbsp;<A NAME="979"></A>

<P>Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so&nbsp;<A NAME="980"></A>good
as answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any&nbsp;<A NAME="981"></A>advantage
over the just?&nbsp;<A NAME="982"></A>

<P>Far otherwise; if he did would not be the simple, amusing creature&nbsp;<A NAME="983"></A>which
he is.&nbsp;<A NAME="984"></A>

<P>And would he try to go beyond just action?&nbsp;<A NAME="985"></A>
<BR>He would not.&nbsp;<A NAME="986"></A>
<BR>And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust;&nbsp;<A NAME="987"></A>would
that be considered by him as just or unjust?&nbsp;<A NAME="988"></A>

<P>He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but&nbsp;<A NAME="989"></A>he
would not be able.&nbsp;<A NAME="990"></A>

<P>Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point.&nbsp;<A NAME="991"></A>My
question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than&nbsp;<A NAME="992"></A>another
just man, would wish and claim to have more than the&nbsp;<A NAME="993"></A>unjust?&nbsp;<A NAME="994"></A>

<P>Yes, he would.&nbsp;<A NAME="995"></A>
<BR>And what of the unjust --does he claim to have more than the just man&nbsp;<A NAME="996"></A>and
to do more than is just&nbsp;<A NAME="997"></A>

<P>Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all&nbsp;<A NAME="998"></A>men.&nbsp;<A NAME="999"></A>
<BR>And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the&nbsp;<A NAME="1000"></A>unjust
man or action, in order that he may have more than&nbsp;<A NAME="1001"></A>all?&nbsp;<A NAME="1002"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1003"></A>
<BR>We may put the matter thus, I said --the just does not desire more&nbsp;<A NAME="1004"></A>than
his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more&nbsp;<A NAME="1005"></A>than
both his like and his unlike?&nbsp;<A NAME="1006"></A>

<P>Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.&nbsp;<A NAME="1007"></A>
<BR>And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is&nbsp;<A NAME="1008"></A>neither?&nbsp;<A NAME="1009"></A>
<BR>Good again, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1010"></A>
<BR>And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike&nbsp;<A NAME="1011"></A>them?&nbsp;<A NAME="1012"></A>

<P>Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those&nbsp;<A NAME="1013"></A>who
are of a certain nature; he who is not, not.&nbsp;<A NAME="1014"></A>

<P>Each of them, I said, is such as his like is?&nbsp;<A NAME="1015"></A>
<BR>Certainly, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1016"></A>
<BR>Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts:&nbsp;<A NAME="1017"></A>you
would admit that one man is a musician and another not a&nbsp;<A NAME="1018"></A>musician?&nbsp;<A NAME="1019"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1020"></A>
<BR>And which is wise and which is foolish?&nbsp;<A NAME="1021"></A>
<BR>Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is&nbsp;<A NAME="1022"></A>foolish.&nbsp;<A NAME="1023"></A>

<P>And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he&nbsp;<A NAME="1024"></A>is
foolish?&nbsp;<A NAME="1025"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1026"></A>
<BR>And you would say the same sort of thing of the&nbsp;<A NAME="1027"></A>physician?&nbsp;<A NAME="1028"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1029"></A>
<BR>And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts&nbsp;<A NAME="1030"></A>the
lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the&nbsp;<A NAME="1031"></A>tightening
and loosening the strings?&nbsp;<A NAME="1032"></A>

<P>I do not think that he would.&nbsp;<A NAME="1033"></A>
<BR>But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?&nbsp;<A NAME="1034"></A>
<BR>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="1035"></A>
<BR>And what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and drinks&nbsp;<A NAME="1036"></A>would
he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of&nbsp;<A NAME="1037"></A>medicine?&nbsp;<A NAME="1038"></A>

<P>He would not.&nbsp;<A NAME="1039"></A>
<BR>But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?&nbsp;<A NAME="1040"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1041"></A>
<BR>And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think&nbsp;<A NAME="1042"></A>that
any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying&nbsp;<A NAME="1043"></A>or
doing more than another man who has knowledge. Would he not rather say&nbsp;<A NAME="1044"></A>or
do the same as his like in the same case?&nbsp;<A NAME="1045"></A>

<P>That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1046"></A>
<BR>And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either&nbsp;<A NAME="1047"></A>the
knowing or the ignorant?&nbsp;<A NAME="1048"></A>

<P>I dare say.&nbsp;<A NAME="1049"></A>
<BR>And the knowing is wise?&nbsp;<A NAME="1050"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1051"></A>
<BR>And the wise is good?&nbsp;<A NAME="1052"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1053"></A>
<BR>Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like,&nbsp;<A NAME="1054"></A>but
more than his unlike and opposite?&nbsp;<A NAME="1055"></A>

<P>I suppose so.&nbsp;<A NAME="1056"></A>
<BR>Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than&nbsp;<A NAME="1057"></A>both?&nbsp;<A NAME="1058"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1059"></A>
<BR>But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both&nbsp;<A NAME="1060"></A>his
like and unlike? Were not these your words? They&nbsp;<A NAME="1061"></A>were.&nbsp;<A NAME="1062"></A>

<P>They were.&nbsp;<A NAME="1063"></A>
<BR>And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his&nbsp;<A NAME="1064"></A>unlike?&nbsp;<A NAME="1065"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1066"></A>
<BR>Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil&nbsp;<A NAME="1067"></A>and
ignorant?&nbsp;<A NAME="1068"></A>

<P>That is the inference.&nbsp;<A NAME="1069"></A>
<BR>And each of them is such as his like is?&nbsp;<A NAME="1070"></A>
<BR>That was admitted.&nbsp;<A NAME="1071"></A>
<BR>Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil&nbsp;<A NAME="1072"></A>and
ignorant.&nbsp;<A NAME="1073"></A>

<P>Thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as I repeat&nbsp;<A NAME="1074"></A>them,
but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's day, and the perspiration&nbsp;<A NAME="1075"></A>poured
from him in torrents; and then I saw what I had never seen before,&nbsp;<A NAME="1076"></A>Thrasymachus
blushing. As we were now agreed that justice was virtue and&nbsp;<A NAME="1077"></A>wisdom,
and injustice vice and ignorance, I proceeded to another&nbsp;<A NAME="1078"></A>point:&nbsp;<A NAME="1079"></A>

<P>Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were&nbsp;<A NAME="1080"></A>we
not also saying that injustice had strength; do you&nbsp;<A NAME="1081"></A>remember?&nbsp;<A NAME="1082"></A>

<P>Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of&nbsp;<A NAME="1083"></A>what
you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you&nbsp;<A NAME="1084"></A>would
be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit&nbsp;<A NAME="1085"></A>me
to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer&nbsp;<A NAME="1086"></A>'Very
good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes'&nbsp;<A NAME="1087"></A>and
'No.'&nbsp;<A NAME="1088"></A>

<P>Certainly not, I said, if contrary to your real&nbsp;<A NAME="1089"></A>opinion.&nbsp;<A NAME="1090"></A>
<BR>Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak.&nbsp;<A NAME="1091"></A>What
else would you have?&nbsp;<A NAME="1092"></A>

<P>Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will&nbsp;<A NAME="1093"></A>ask
and you shall answer.&nbsp;<A NAME="1094"></A>

<P>Proceed.&nbsp;<A NAME="1095"></A>
<BR>Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order that&nbsp;<A NAME="1096"></A>our
examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be&nbsp;<A NAME="1097"></A>carried
on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is stronger and&nbsp;<A NAME="1098"></A>more
powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified with&nbsp;<A NAME="1099"></A>wisdom
and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice, if injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="1100"></A>is
ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one. But I want to&nbsp;<A NAME="1101"></A>view
the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You would not deny that&nbsp;<A NAME="1102"></A>a
state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states,&nbsp;<A NAME="1103"></A>or
may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in&nbsp;<A NAME="1104"></A>subjection?&nbsp;<A NAME="1105"></A>

<P>True, he replied; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="1106"></A>state
will be most likely to do so.&nbsp;<A NAME="1107"></A>

<P>I know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further&nbsp;<A NAME="1108"></A>consider
is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior state&nbsp;<A NAME="1109"></A>can
exist or be exercised without justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="1110"></A>

<P>If you are right in you view, and justice is wisdom, then only&nbsp;<A NAME="1111"></A>with
justice; but if I am right, then without justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="1112"></A>

<P>I am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent&nbsp;<A NAME="1113"></A>and
dissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.&nbsp;<A NAME="1114"></A>

<P>That is out of civility to you, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1115"></A>
<BR>You are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to&nbsp;<A NAME="1116"></A>inform
me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of robbers&nbsp;<A NAME="1117"></A>and
thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if they injured&nbsp;<A NAME="1118"></A>one
another?&nbsp;<A NAME="1119"></A>

<P>No indeed, he said, they could not.&nbsp;<A NAME="1120"></A>
<BR>But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act&nbsp;<A NAME="1121"></A>together
better?&nbsp;<A NAME="1122"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1123"></A>
<BR>And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting,&nbsp;<A NAME="1124"></A>and
justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true,&nbsp;<A NAME="1125"></A>Thrasymachus?&nbsp;<A NAME="1126"></A>

<P>I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with&nbsp;<A NAME="1127"></A>you.&nbsp;<A NAME="1128"></A>
<BR>How good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether injustice,&nbsp;<A NAME="1129"></A>having
this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing, among slaves&nbsp;<A NAME="1130"></A>or
among freemen, will not make them hate one another and set them at variance&nbsp;<A NAME="1131"></A>and
render them incapable of common action?&nbsp;<A NAME="1132"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1133"></A>
<BR>And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and&nbsp;<A NAME="1134"></A>fight,
and become enemies to one another and to the&nbsp;<A NAME="1135"></A>just&nbsp;<A NAME="1136"></A>

<P>They will.&nbsp;<A NAME="1137"></A>
<BR>And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="1138"></A>say
that she loses or that she retains her natural power?&nbsp;<A NAME="1139"></A>

<P>Let us assume that she retains her power.&nbsp;<A NAME="1140"></A>
<BR>Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that&nbsp;<A NAME="1141"></A>wherever
she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a family,&nbsp;<A NAME="1142"></A>or
in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered incapable of&nbsp;<A NAME="1143"></A>united
action by reason of sedition and distraction; and does it not become&nbsp;<A NAME="1144"></A>its
own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it, and with the just?&nbsp;<A NAME="1145"></A>Is
not this the case?&nbsp;<A NAME="1146"></A>

<P>Yes, certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1147"></A>
<BR>And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person;&nbsp;<A NAME="1148"></A>in
the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not&nbsp;<A NAME="1149"></A>at
unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to himself&nbsp;<A NAME="1150"></A>and
the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus?&nbsp;<A NAME="1151"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1152"></A>
<BR>And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?&nbsp;<A NAME="1153"></A>
<BR>Granted that they are.&nbsp;<A NAME="1154"></A>
<BR>But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will&nbsp;<A NAME="1155"></A>be
their friend?&nbsp;<A NAME="1156"></A>

<P>Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will&nbsp;<A NAME="1157"></A>not
oppose you, lest I should displease the company.&nbsp;<A NAME="1158"></A>

<P>Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder&nbsp;<A NAME="1159"></A>of
my repast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser&nbsp;<A NAME="1160"></A>and
better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable&nbsp;<A NAME="1161"></A>of
common action; nay ing at more, that to speak as we did of men who are&nbsp;<A NAME="1162"></A>evil
acting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for&nbsp;<A NAME="1163"></A>if
they had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one another;&nbsp;<A NAME="1164"></A>but
it is evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in&nbsp;<A NAME="1165"></A>them,
which enabled them to combine; if there had not been they would have&nbsp;<A NAME="1166"></A>injured
one another as well as their victims; they were but half --villains&nbsp;<A NAME="1167"></A>in
their enterprises; for had they been whole villains, and utterly unjust,&nbsp;<A NAME="1168"></A>they
would have been utterly incapable of action. That, as I believe, is&nbsp;<A NAME="1169"></A>the
truth of the matter, and not what you said at first. But whether the&nbsp;<A NAME="1170"></A>just
have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question&nbsp;<A NAME="1171"></A>which
we also proposed to consider. I think that they have, and for the&nbsp;<A NAME="1172"></A>reasons
which to have given; but still I should like to examine further,&nbsp;<A NAME="1173"></A>for
no light matter is at stake, nothing less than the rule of human&nbsp;<A NAME="1174"></A>life.&nbsp;<A NAME="1175"></A>

<P>Proceed.&nbsp;<A NAME="1176"></A>
<BR>I will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse&nbsp;<A NAME="1177"></A>has
some end?&nbsp;<A NAME="1178"></A>

<P>I should.&nbsp;<A NAME="1179"></A>
<BR>And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could&nbsp;<A NAME="1180"></A>not
be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other&nbsp;<A NAME="1181"></A>thing?&nbsp;<A NAME="1182"></A>

<P>I do not understand, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1183"></A>
<BR>Let me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?&nbsp;<A NAME="1184"></A>
<BR>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="1185"></A>
<BR>Or hear, except with the ear?&nbsp;<A NAME="1186"></A>
<BR>No.&nbsp;<A NAME="1187"></A>
<BR>These then may be truly said to be the ends of these&nbsp;<A NAME="1188"></A>organs?&nbsp;<A NAME="1189"></A>
<BR>They may.&nbsp;<A NAME="1190"></A>
<BR>But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1191"></A>in
many other ways?&nbsp;<A NAME="1192"></A>

<P>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="1193"></A>
<BR>And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the&nbsp;<A NAME="1194"></A>purpose?&nbsp;<A NAME="1195"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1196"></A>
<BR>May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?&nbsp;<A NAME="1197"></A>
<BR>We may.&nbsp;<A NAME="1198"></A>
<BR>Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning&nbsp;<A NAME="1199"></A>when
I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which&nbsp;<A NAME="1200"></A>could
not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other&nbsp;<A NAME="1201"></A>thing?&nbsp;<A NAME="1202"></A>

<P>I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.&nbsp;<A NAME="1203"></A>
<BR>And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need&nbsp;<A NAME="1204"></A>I
ask again whether the eye has an end?&nbsp;<A NAME="1205"></A>

<P>It has.&nbsp;<A NAME="1206"></A>
<BR>And has not the eye an excellence?&nbsp;<A NAME="1207"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1208"></A>
<BR>And the ear has an end and an excellence also?&nbsp;<A NAME="1209"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1210"></A>
<BR>And the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an&nbsp;<A NAME="1211"></A>end
and a special excellence?&nbsp;<A NAME="1212"></A>

<P>That is so.&nbsp;<A NAME="1213"></A>
<BR>Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their&nbsp;<A NAME="1214"></A>own
proper excellence and have a defect instead?&nbsp;<A NAME="1215"></A>

<P>How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot&nbsp;<A NAME="1216"></A>see?&nbsp;<A NAME="1217"></A>
<BR>You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is&nbsp;<A NAME="1218"></A>sight;
but I have not arrived at that point yet. I would rather ask the&nbsp;<A NAME="1219"></A>question
more generally, and only enquire whether the things which fulfil&nbsp;<A NAME="1220"></A>their
ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fall of fulfilling&nbsp;<A NAME="1221"></A>them
by their own defect?&nbsp;<A NAME="1222"></A>

<P>Certainly, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1223"></A>
<BR>I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper&nbsp;<A NAME="1224"></A>excellence
they cannot fulfil their end?&nbsp;<A NAME="1225"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1226"></A>
<BR>And the same observation will apply to all other&nbsp;<A NAME="1227"></A>things?&nbsp;<A NAME="1228"></A>
<BR>I agree.&nbsp;<A NAME="1229"></A>
<BR>Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for&nbsp;<A NAME="1230"></A>example,
to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. Are not&nbsp;<A NAME="1231"></A>these
functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to&nbsp;<A NAME="1232"></A>any
other?&nbsp;<A NAME="1233"></A>

<P>To no other.&nbsp;<A NAME="1234"></A>
<BR>And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the&nbsp;<A NAME="1235"></A>soul?&nbsp;<A NAME="1236"></A>
<BR>Assuredly, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1237"></A>
<BR>And has not the soul an excellence also?&nbsp;<A NAME="1238"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1239"></A>
<BR>And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that&nbsp;<A NAME="1240"></A>excellence?&nbsp;<A NAME="1241"></A>

<P>She cannot.&nbsp;<A NAME="1242"></A>
<BR>Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent,&nbsp;<A NAME="1243"></A>and
the good soul a good ruler?&nbsp;<A NAME="1244"></A>

<P>Yes, necessarily.&nbsp;<A NAME="1245"></A>
<BR>And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1246"></A>injustice
the defect of the soul?&nbsp;<A NAME="1247"></A>

<P>That has been admitted.&nbsp;<A NAME="1248"></A>
<BR>Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="1249"></A>man
will live ill?&nbsp;<A NAME="1250"></A>

<P>That is what your argument proves.&nbsp;<A NAME="1251"></A>
<BR>And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the&nbsp;<A NAME="1252"></A>reverse
of happy?&nbsp;<A NAME="1253"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1254"></A>
<BR>Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?&nbsp;<A NAME="1255"></A>
<BR>So be it.&nbsp;<A NAME="1256"></A>
<BR>But happiness and not misery is profitable.&nbsp;<A NAME="1257"></A>
<BR>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="1258"></A>
<BR>Then, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable&nbsp;<A NAME="1259"></A>than
justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="1260"></A>

<P>Let this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the&nbsp;<A NAME="1261"></A>Bendidea.&nbsp;<A NAME="1262"></A>
<BR>For which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle&nbsp;<A NAME="1263"></A>towards
me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, I have not been well&nbsp;<A NAME="1264"></A>entertained;
but that was my own fault and not yours. As an epicure snatches&nbsp;<A NAME="1265"></A>a
taste of every dish which is successively brought to table, he not having&nbsp;<A NAME="1266"></A>allowed
himself time to enjoy the one before, so have I gone from one subject&nbsp;<A NAME="1267"></A>to
another without having discovered what I sought at first, the nature&nbsp;<A NAME="1268"></A>of
justice. I left that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice&nbsp;<A NAME="1269"></A>is
virtue and wisdom or evil and folly; and when there arose a further&nbsp;<A NAME="1270"></A>question
about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice, I could&nbsp;<A NAME="1271"></A>not
refrain from passing on to that. And the result of the whole discussion&nbsp;<A NAME="1272"></A>has
been that I know nothing at all. For I know not what justice is, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1273"></A>therefore
I am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue, nor&nbsp;<A NAME="1274"></A>can
I say whether the just man is happy or unhappy.&nbsp;<A NAME="end"></A>
