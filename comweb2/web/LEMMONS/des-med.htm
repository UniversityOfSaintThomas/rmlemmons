<b>The first edition of the <i>Meditations</i> was published in Latin by
Michael Soly of Paris <i>at the Sign of the Phoenix</i> in 1641 cum Privilegio
et Approbatione Doctorum. The Royal <i>privilege</i> was indeed given,
but the <i>approbation</i> seems to have been of a most indefinite kind.
The reason of the book being published in France and not in Holland, where
Descartes was living in a charming country house at Endegeest near Leiden,
was apparently his fear that the Dutch ministers might in some way lay
hold of it. His friend, Pere Mersenne, took charge of its publication in
Paris and wrote to him about any difficulties that occurred in the course
of its progress through the press. The second edition was however published
at Amsterdam in 1642 by Louis Elzevir, and this edition was accompanied
by the now completed <i>Objections and Replies.</i><sup>2</sup> The edition
from which the present translation is made is the second just mentioned,
and is that adopted by MM. Adam and Tannery as the more correct, for reasons
that they state in detail in the preface to their edition. The work was
translated into French by the Duc de Luynes in 1642 and Descartes considered
the translation so excellent that he had it published some years later.
Clerselier, to complete matters, had the <i>Objections</i> also published
in French with the <i>Replies,</i> and this, like the other, was subject
to Descartes' revision and correction. This revision renders the French
edition specially valuable. Where it seems desirable an alternative reading
from the French is given in square brackets.</b></dd>

<p><b>To the Most Wise and Illustrious the Dean and Doctors of the Sacred
Faculty of Theology in Paris.</b>
<dd>
<b>The motive which induces me to present to you this Treatise is so excellent,
and, when you become acquainted with its design, I am convinced that you
will also have so excellent a motive for taking it under your protection,
that I feel that I cannot do better, in order to render it in some sort
acceptable to you, than in a few words to state what I have set myself
to do.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I have always considered that the two questions respecting God and the
Soul were the chief of those that ought to be demonstrated by philosophical
rather than theological argument. For although it is quite enough for us
faithful ones to accept by means of faith the fact that the human soul
does not perish with the body, and that God exists, it certainly does not
seem possible ever to persuade infidels of any religion, indeed, we may
almost say, of any moral virtue, unless, to begin with, we prove these
two facts by means of the natural reason. And inasmuch as often in this
life greater rewards are offered for vice than for virtue, few people would
prefer the right to the useful, were they restrained neither by the fear
of God nor the expectation of another life; and although it is absolutely
true that we must believe that there is a God, because we are so taught
in the Holy Scriptures, and, on the other hand, that we must believe the
Holy Scriptures because they come from God (the reason of this is, that,
faith being a gift of God, He who gives the grace to cause us to believe
other things can likewise give it to cause us to believe that He exists),
we nevertheless could not place this argument before infidels, who might
accuse us of reasoning in a circle. And, in truth, I have noticed that
you, along with all the theologians, did not only affirm that the existence
of God may be proved by the natural reason, but also that it may be inferred
from the Holy Scriptures, that knowledge about Him is much clearer than
that which we have of many created things, and, as a matter of fact, is
so easy to acquire, that those who have it not are culpable in their ignorance.
This indeed appears from the Wisdom of Solomon, chapter xiii., where it
is said <i>Howbeit they are not to be excused; for if their understanding
was so great that they could discern the world and the creatures, why did
they not rather find out the Lord thereof?</i> and in Romans, chapter i.,
it is said that they are <i>without excuse</i>; and again in the same place,
by these words <i>that which may be known of God is manifest in them,</i>
it seems as through we were shown that all that which can be known of God
may be made manifest by means which are not derived from anywhere but from
ourselves, and from the simple consideration of the nature of our minds.
Hence I thought it not beside my purpose to inquire how this is so, and
how God may be more easily and certainly known than the things of the world.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And as regards the soul, although many have considered that it is not
easy to know its nature, and some have even dared to say that human reasons
have convinced us that it would perish with the body, and that faith alone
could believe the contrary, nevertheless, inasmuch as the Lateran Council
held under Leo X (in the eighth session) condemns these tenets, and as
Leo expressly ordains Christian philosophers to refute their arguments
and to employ all their powers in making known the truth, I have ventured
in this treatise to undertake the same task.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>More than that, I am aware that the principal reason which causes many
impious persons not to desire to believe that there is a God, and that
the human soul is distinct from the body, is that they declare that hitherto
no one has been able to demonstrate these two facts; and although I am
not of their opinion but, on the contrary, hold that the greater part of
the reasons which have been brought forward concerning these two questions
by so many great men are, when they are rightly understood, equal to so
many demonstrations, and that it is almost impossible to invent new ones,
it is yet in my opinion the case that nothing more useful can be accomplished
in philosophy than once for all to seek with care for the best of these
reasons, and to set them forth in so clear and exact a manner, that it
will henceforth be evident to everybody that they are veritable demonstrations.
And, finally, inasmuch as it was desired that I should undertake this task
by many who were aware that I had cultivated a certain Method for the resolution
of difficulties of every kind in the Sciences -- a method which it is true
is not novel, since there is nothing more ancient than the truth, but of
which they were aware that I had made use successfully enough in other
matters of difficulty -- I have thought that it was my duty also to make
trial of it in the present matter.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Now all that I could accomplish in the matter is contained in this Treatise.
Not that I have here drawn together all the different reasons which might
be brought forward to serve as proofs of this subject: for that never seemed
to be necessary excepting when there was no one single proof that was certain.
But I have treated the first and principal ones in such a manner that I
can venture to bring them forward as very evident and very certain demonstrations.
And more than that, I will say that these proofs are such that I do not
think that there is any way open to the human mind by which it can ever
succeed in discovering better. For the importance of the subject, and the
glory of God to which all this relates, constrain me to speak here somewhat
more freely of myself than is my habit. Nevertheless, whatever certainty
and evidence I find in my reasons, I cannot persuade myself that all the
world is capable of understanding them. Still, just as in Geometry there
are many demonstrations that have been left to us by Archimedes, by Apollonius,
by Pappus, and others, which are accepted by everyone as perfectly certain
and evident (because they clearly contain nothing which, considered by
itself, is not very easy to understand, and as all through that which follows
has an exact connection with, and dependence on that which precedes), nevertheless,
because they are somewhat lengthy, and demand a mind wholly devoted tot
heir consideration, they are only taken in and understood by a very limited
number of persons. Similarly, although I judge that those of which I here
make use are equal to, or even surpass in certainty and evidence, the demonstrations
of Geometry, I yet apprehend that they cannot be adequately understood
by many, both because they are also a little lengthy and dependent the
one on the other, and principally because they demand a mind wholly free
of prejudices, and one which can be easily detached from the affairs of
the senses. And, truth to say, there are not so many in the world who are
fitted for metaphysical speculations as there are for those of Geometry.
And more than that; there is still this difference, that in Geometry, since
each one is persuaded that nothing must be advanced of which there is not
a certain demonstration, those who are not entirely adepts more frequently
err in approving what is false, in order to give the impression that they
understand it, than in refuting the true. But the case is different in
philosophy where everyone believes that all is problematical, and few give
themselves to the search after truth; and the greater number, in their
desire to acquire a reputation for boldness of thought, arrogantly combat
the most important of truths.<sup>3</sup></b></dd>

<dd>
<b>That is why, whatever force there may be in my reasonings, seeing they
belong to philosophy, I cannot hope that they will have much effect on
the minds of men, unless you extend to them your protection. But the estimation
in which you Company is universally held is so great, and the name of Sorbonne
carries with it so much authority, that, next to the Sacred Councils, never
has such deference been paid to the judgment of any Body, not only in what
concerns the faith, but also in what regards human philosophy as well:
everyone indeed believes that it is not possible to discover elsewhere
more perspicacity and solidity, or more integrity and wisdom in pronouncing
judgment. For this reason I have no doubt that if you deign to take the
trouble in the first place of correcting this work (for being conscious
not only of my infirmity, but also of my ignorance, I should not dare to
state that it was free from errors), and then, after adding to it these
things that are lacking to it, completing those which are imperfect, and
yourselves taking the trouble to give a more ample explanation of those
things which have need of it, or at least making me aware of the defects
so that I may apply myself to remedy them<sup>4</sup> -- when this is done
and when finally the reasonings by which I prove that there is a God, and
that the human soul differs from the body, shall be carried to that point
of perspicuity to which I am sure they can be carried in order that they
may be esteemed as perfectly exact demonstrations, if you deign to authorize
your approbation and to render public testimony to their truth and certainty,
I do not doubt, I say, that henceforward all the errors and false opinions
which have ever existed regarding these two questions will soon be effaced
from the minds of men. For the truth itself will easily cause all men of
mind and learning to subscribe to your judgment; and your authority will
cause the atheists, who are usually more arrogant than learned or judicious,
to rid themselves of their spirit of contradiction or lead them possibly
themselves to defend the reasonings which they find being received as demonstrations
by all persons of consideration, lest they appear not to understand them.
And, finally, all others will easily yield to such a mass of evidence,
and there will be none who dares to doubt the existence of God and the
real and true distinction between the human soul and the body. It is for
you now in your singular wisdom to judge of the importance of the establishment
of such beliefs [you who see the disorders produced by the doubt of them]<sup>5</sup>
. But it would not become me to say more in consideration of the cause
of God and religion to those who have always been the most worthy supports
of the Catholic Church.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I have already slightly touched on these two questions of God and the
human soul in the Discourse on the Method of rightly conducting the Reason
and seeking truth in the Sciences, published in French in the year 1637.
Not that I had the design of treating these with any thoroughness, but
only so to speak in passing, and in order to ascertain by the judgment
of the readers how I should treat them later on. For these questions have
always appeared to me to be of such importance that I judged it suitable
to speak of them more than once; and the road which I follow in the explanation
of them is so little trodden, and so far removed from the ordinary path,
that I did not judge it to be expedient to set it forth at length in French
and in a Discourse which might be read by everyone, in case the feebler
minds should believe that it was permitted to them to attempt to follow
the same path.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But, having in this Discourse on Method begged all those who have found
in my writings somewhat deserving of censure to do me the favour of acquainting
me with the grounds of it, nothing worthy of remark has been objected to
in them beyond two matters: to these two I wish here to reply in a few
words before undertaking their more detailed discussion.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>The first objection is that it does not follow from the fact that the
human mind reflecting on itself does not perceive itself to be other than
a thing that thinks, that its nature or its essence consists only in its
being a thing that thinks, in the sense that this word only excludes all
other things which might also be supposed to pertain to the nature of the
soul. To this objection I reply that it was not my intention in that place
to exclude these in accordance with the order that looks to the truth of
the matter (as to which I was not then dealing), but only in accordance
with the order of my thought [perception]; thus my meaning was that so
far as I was aware, I knew nothing clearly as belonging to my essence,
excepting that I was a thing that thinks, or a thing that has in itself
the faculty of thinking. But I shall show hereafter how from the fact that
I know no other thing which pertains to my essence, it follows that there
is no other thing which really does belong to it.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>The second objection is that it does not follow from the fact that I
have in myself the idea of something more perfect than I am, that this
idea is more perfect than I, and much less that what is represented by
this idea exists. But I reply that in this term idea there is here something
equivocal, for it may either be taken materially, as an act of my understanding,
and in this sense it cannot be said that it is more perfect than I; or
it may be taken objectively, as the thing which is represented by this
act, which, although we do not suppose it to exist outside of my understanding,
may, none the less, be more perfect than I, because of its essence. And
in following out this Treatise I shall show more fully how, from the sole
fact that I have in myself the idea of a thing more perfect than myself,
it follows that this thing truly exists.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In addition to these two objections I have also seen two fairly lengthy
works on this subject, which, however, did not so much impugn my reasonings
as my conclusions, and this by arguments drawn from the ordinary atheistic
sources. But, because such arguments cannot make any impression on the
minds of those who really understand my reasonings, and as the judgments
of many are so feeble and irrational that they very often allow themselves
to be persuaded by the opinions which they have first formed, however false
and far removed from reason they may be, rather than by a true and solid
but subsequently received refutation of these opinions, I do not desire
to reply here to their criticisms in case of being first of all obliged
to state them. I shall only say in general that all that is said by the
atheist against the existence of God, always depends either on the fact
that we ascribe to God affections which are human, or that we attribute
so much strength and wisdom to our minds that we even have the presumption
to desire to determine and understand that which God can and ought to do.
In this way all that they allege will cause us no difficulty, provided
only we remember that we must consider our minds as things which are finite
and limited, and God as a Being who is incomprehensible and infinite.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Now that I have once for all recognised and acknowledged the opinions
of men, I at once begin to treat of God and the Human soul, and at the
same time to treat of the whole of the First Philosophy, without however
expecting any praise from the vulgar and without the hope that my book
will have many readers. On the contrary, I should never advise anyone to
read it excepting those who desire to meditate seriously with me, and who
can detach their minds from affairs of sense, and deliver themselves entirely
from every sort of prejudice. I know too well that such men exist in a
very small number. But for those who, without caring to comprehend the
order and connections of my reasonings, form their criticisms on detached
portions arbitrarily selected, as is the custom with many, these, I say,
will not obtain much profit from reading this Treatise. And although they
perhaps in several parts find occasion of cavilling, they can for all their
pains make no objection which is urgent or deserving of reply.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And inasmuch as I make no promise to others to satisfy them at once,
and as I do not presume so much on my own powers as to believe myself capable
of foreseeing all that can cause difficulty to anyone, I shall first of
all set forth in these Meditations the very considerations by which I persuade
myself that I have reached a certain and evident knowledge of the truth,
in order to see if, by the same reasons which persuaded me, I can also
persuade others. And, after that, I shall reply to the objections which
have been made to me by persons of genius and learning to whom I have sent
my Meditations for examination, before submitting them to the press. For
they have made so many objections and these so different, that I venture
to promise that it will be difficult for anyone to bring to mind criticisms
of any consequence which have not been already touched upon. This is why
I beg those who read these Meditations to form no judgment upon them unless
they have given themselves the trouble to read all the objections as well
as the replies which I have made to them.<sup>6</sup></b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In the first Meditation I set forth the reasons for which we may, generally
speaking, doubt about all things and especially about material things,
at least so long as we have no other foundations for the sciences than
those which we have hitherto possessed. But although the utility of a Doubt
which is so general does not at first appear, it is at the same time very
great, inasmuch as it delivers us from every kind of prejudice, and sets
out for us a very simple way by which the mind may detach itself from the
senses; and finally it makes it impossible for us ever to doubt those things
which we have once discovered to be true.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In the second Meditation, mind, which making use of the liberty which
pertains to it, takes for granted that all those things of whose existence
it has the least doubt, are non-existent, recognises that it is however
absolutely impossible that it does not itself exist. This point is likewise
of the greatest moment, inasmuch as by this means a distinction is easily
drawn between the things which pertain to mind -- that is to say to the
intellectual nature -- and those which pertain to body.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But because it may be that some expect from me in this place a statement
of the reasons establishing the immortality of the soul, I feel that I
should here make known to them that having aimed at writing nothing in
all this Treatise of which I do not possess very exact demonstrations,
I am obliged to follow a similar order to that made use of by the geometers,
which is to begin by putting forward as premises all those things upon
which the proposition that we seek depends, before coming to any conclusion
regarding it. Now the first and principal matter which is requisite for
thoroughly understanding the immortality of the soul is to form the clearest
possible conception of it, and one which will be entirely distinct from
all the conceptions which we may have of body; and in this Meditation this
has been done. In addition to this it is requisite that we may be assured
that all the things which we conceive clearly and distinctly are true in
the very way in which we think them; and this could not be proved previously
to the Fourth Mediation. Further we must have a distinct conception of
corporeal nature, which is given partly in this Second, and partly in the
Fifth and Sixth Meditations. And finally we should conclude from all this,
that those things which we conceive clearly and distinctly as being diverse
substances, as we regard mind and body to be, are really substances essentially
distinct one from the other; and this is the conclusion of the Sixth Meditation.
This is further confirmed in this same Meditation by the fact that we cannot
conceive of body excepting in so far as it is divisible, while the mind
cannot be conceived of excepting as indivisible. For we are not able to
conceive of the half of a mind as we can do of the smallest of all bodies;
so that we see that not only are their natures different but even in some
respects contrary to one another. I have not however dealt further with
this matter in this treatise, both because what I have said is sufficient
to show clearly enough that the extinction of the mind does not follow
from the corruption of the body, and also to give men the hope of another
life after death, as also because the premises from which the immortality
of the soul may be deduced depend on an elucidation of a complete system
of Physics. This would mean to establish in the first place that all substances
generally -- that is to say all things which cannot exist without being
created by God -- are in their nature incorruptible, and that they can
never cease to exist unless God, in denying to them his concurrence, reduce
them to nought; and secondly that body, regarded generally, is a substance,
which is the reason why it also cannot perish, but that the human body,
inasmuch as it differs from other bodies, is composed only of a certain
configuration of members and of other similar accidents, while the human
mind is not similarly composed of any accidents, but is a pure substance.
For although all the accidents of mind be changed, although, for instance,
it think certain things, will others, perceive others, etc., despite all
this it does not emerge from these changes another mind: the human body
on the other hand becomes a different thing from the sole fact that the
figure or form of any of its portions is found to be changed. From this
it follows that the human body may indeed easily enough perish, but the
mind [or soul of man (I make no distinction between them)] is owing to
its nature immortal.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In the third Meditation it seems to me that I have explained at sufficient
length the principal argument of which I make use in order to prove the
existence of God. But none the less, because I did not wish in that place
to make use of any comparisons derived from corporeal things, so as to
withdraw as much as I could the minds of readers from the senses, there
may perhaps have remained many obscurities which, however, will, I hope,
be entirely removed by the Replies which I have made to the Objections
which have been set before me. Amongst others there is, for example, this
one, How the idea in us of a being supremely perfect possesses so much
objective reality [that is to say participates by representation in so
many degrees of being and perfection] that it necessarily proceeds from
a cause which is absolutely perfect. This is illustrated in these Replies
by the comparison of a very perfect machine, the idea of which is found
in the mind of some workman. For as the objective contrivance of this idea
must have some cause, i.e. either the science of the workman or that of
some other from whom he has received the idea, it is similarly impossible
that the idea of God which is in us should not have God himself as its
cause.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In the fourth Meditation it is shown that all these things which we
very clearly and distinctly perceive are true, and at the same time it
is explained in what the nature of error or falsity consists. This must
of necessity be known both for the confirmation of the preceding truths
and for the better comprehension of those that follow. (But it must meanwhile
be remarked that I do not in any way there treat of sin -- that is to say
of the error which is committed in the pursuit of good and evil, but only
of that which arises in the deciding between the true and the false. And
I do not intend to speak of matters pertaining to the Faith or the conduct
of life, but only of those which concern speculative truths, and which
may be known by the sole aid of the light of nature.)</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In the fifth Meditation corporeal nature generally is explained, and
in addition to this the existence of God is demonstrated by a new proof
in which there may possibly be certain difficulties also, but the solution
of these will be seen in the Replies to the Objections. And further I show
in what sense it is true to say that the certainty of geometrical demonstrations
is itself dependent on the knowledge of God.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Finally in the Sixth I distinguish the action of the understanding<sup>7</sup>
from that of the imagination;<sup>8</sup> the marks by which this distinction
is made are described. I here show that the mind of man is really distinct
from the body, and at the same time that the two are so closely joined
together that they form, so to speak, a single thing. All the errors which
proceed from the senses are then surveyed, while the means of avoiding
them are demonstrated, and finally all the reasons from which we may deduce
the existence of material things are set forth. Not that I judge them to
be very useful in establishing that which they prove, to wit, that there
is in truth a world, that men possess bodies, and other such things which
never have been doubted by anyone of sense; but because in considering
these closely we come to see that they are neither so strong nor so evident
as those arguments which lead us to the knowledge of our mind and of God;
so that these last must be the most certain and most evident facts which
can fall within the cognizance of the human mind. And this is the whole
matter that I have tried to prove in these Meditations, for which reason
I here omit to speak of many other questions which I dealt incidentally
in this discussion.</b></dd>

<b>It is now some years since I detected how many were the false beliefs
that I had from my earliest youth admitted as true, and how doubtful was
everything I had since constructed on this basis; and from that time I
was convinced that I must once for all seriously undertake to rid myself
of all the opinions which I had formerly accepted, and commence to build
anew from the foundation, if I wanted to establish any firm and permanent
structure in the sciences. But as this enterprise appeared to be a very
great one, I waited until I had attained an age so mature that I could
not hope that at any later date I should be better fitted to execute my
design. This reason caused me to delay so long that I should feel that
I was doing wrong were I to occupy in deliberation the time that yet remains
to me for action. To-day, then, since very opportunely for the plan I have
in view I have delivered my mind from every care [and am happily agitated
by no passions] and since I have procured for myself an assured leisure
in a peaceable retirement, I shall at last seriously and freely address
myself to the general upheaval of all my former opinions.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Now for this object it is not necessary that I should show that all
of these are false -- I shall perhaps never arrive at this end. But inasmuch
as reason already persuades me that I ought no less carefully to withhold
my assent from matters which are not entirely certain and indubitable than
from those which appear to me manifestly to be false, if I am able to find
in each one some reason to doubt, this will suffice to justify my rejecting
the whole. And for that end it will not be requisite that I should examine
each in particular, which would be an endless undertaking; for owing to
the fact that the destruction of the foundations of necessity brings with
it the downfall of the rest of the edifice, I shall only in the first place
attack those principles upon which all my former opinions rested.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>All that up to the present time I have accepted as most true and certain
I have learned either from the senses or through the senses; but it is
sometimes proved to me that these senses are deceptive, and it is wiser
not to trust entirely to anything by which we have once been deceived.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But it may be that although the senses sometimes deceive us concerning
things which are hardly perceptible, or very far away, there are yet many
others to be met with as to which we cannot reasonably have any doubt,
although we recognise them by their means. For example, there is the fact
that I am here, seated by the fire, attired in a dressing gown, having
this paper in my hands and other similar matters. And how could I deny
that these hands and this body are mine, were it not perhaps that I compare
myself to certain persons, devoid of sense, whose cerebella are so troubled
and clouded by the violent vapours of black bile, that they constantly
assure us that they think they are kings when they are really quite poor,
or that they are clothed in purple when they are really without covering,
or who imagine that they have an earthenware head or are nothing but pumpkins
or are made of glass. But they are mad, and I should not be any the less
insane were I to follow examples so extravagant.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>At the same time I must remember that I am a man, and that consequently
I am in the habit of sleeping, and in my dreams representing to myself
the same things or sometimes even less probable things, than do those who
are insane in their waking moments. How often has it happened to me that
in the night I dreamt that I found myself in this particular place, that
I was dressed and seated near the fire, whilst in reality I was lying undressed
in bed! At this moment it does indeed seem to me that it is with eyes awake
that I am looking at this paper; that this head which I move is not asleep,
that it is deliberately and of set purpose that I extend my hand and perceive
it; what happens in sleep does not appear so clear nor so distinct as does
all this. But in thinking over this I remind myself that on many occasions
I have in sleep been deceived by similar illusions, and in dwelling carefully
on this reflection I see so manifestly that there are no certain indications
by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep that I am lost
in astonishment. And my astonishment is such that it is almost capable
of persuading me that I now dream.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Now let us assume that we are asleep and that all these particulars,
e.g. that we open our eyes, shake our head, extend our hands, and so on,
are but false delusions; and let us reflect that possibly neither our hands
nor our whole body are such as they appear to us to be. At the same time
we must at least confess that the things which are represented to us in
sleep are like painted representations which can only have been formed
as the counterparts of something real and true, and that in this way those
general things at least, i.e. eyes, a head, hands, and a whole body, are
not imaginary things, but things really existent. For, as a matter of fact,
painters, even when they study with the greatest skill to represent sirens
and satyrs by forms the most strange and extraordinary, cannot give them
natures which are entirely new, but merely make a certain medley of the
members of different animals; or if their imagination is extravagant enough
to invent something so novel that nothing similar has ever before been
seen, and that then their work represents a thing purely fictitious and
absolutely false, it is certain all the same that the colours of which
this is composed are necessarily real. And for the same reason, although
these general things, to with, [a body], eyes, a head, hands, and such
like, may be imaginary, we are bound at the same time to confess that there
are at least some other objects yet more simple and more universal, which
are real and true; and of these just in the same way as with certain real
colours, all these images of things which dwell in our thoughts, whether
true and real or false and fantastic, are formed.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>To such a class of things pertains corporeal nature in general, and
its extension, the figure of extended things, their quantity or magnitude
and number, as also the place in which they are, the time which measures
their duration, and so on.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>That is possibly why our reasoning is not unjust when we conclude from
this that Physics, Astronomy, Medicine and all other sciences which have
as their end the consideration of composite things, are very dubious and
uncertain; but that Arithmetic, Geometry and other sciences of that kind
which only treat of things that are very simple and very general, without
taking great trouble to ascertain whether they are actually existent or
not, contain some measure of certainty and an element of the indubitable.
For whether I am awake or asleep, two and three together always form five,
and the square can never have more than four sides, and it does not seem
possible that truths so clear and apparent can be suspected of any falsity
[or uncertainty].</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Nevertheless I have long had fixed in my mind the belief that an all-powerful
God existed by whom I have been created such as I am. But how do I know
that He has not brought it to pass that there is no earth, no heaven, no
extended body, no magnitude, no place, and that nevertheless [I possess
the perceptions of all these things and that] they seem to me to exist
just exactly as I now see them? And, besides, as I sometimes imagine that
others deceive themselves in the things which they think they know best,
how do I know that I am not deceived every time that I add two and three,
or count the sides of a square, or judge of things yet simpler, if anything
simpler can be imagined? But possibly God has not desired that I should
be thus deceived, for He is said to be supremely good. If, however, it
is contrary to His goodness to have made me such that I constantly deceive
myself, it would also appear to be contrary to His goodness to permit me
to be sometimes deceived, and nevertheless I cannot doubt that He does
permit this.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>There may indeed be those who would prefer to deny the existence of
a God so powerful, rather than believe that all other things are uncertain.
But let us not oppose them for the present, and grant that all that is
here said of a God is a fable; nevertheless in whatever way they suppose
that I have arrived at the state of being that I have reached -- whether
they attribute it to fate or to accident, or make out that it is by a continual
succession of antecedents, or by some other method -- since to err and
deceive oneself is a defect, it is clear that the greater will be the probability
of my being so imperfect as to deceive myself ever, as is the Author to
whom they assign my origin the less powerful. To these reasons I have certainly
nothing to reply, but at the end I feel constrained to confess that there
is nothing in all that I formerly believed to be true, of which I cannot
in some measure doubt, and that not merely through want of thought or through
levity, but for reasons which are very powerful and maturely considered;
so that henceforth I ought not the less carefully to refrain from giving
credence to these opinions than to that which is manifestly false, if I
desire to arrive at any certainty [in the sciences].</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But it is not sufficient to have made these remarks, we must also be
careful to keep them in mind. For these ancient and commonly held opinions
still revert frequently to my mind, long and familiar custom having given
them the right to occupy my mind against my inclination and rendered them
almost masters of my belief; nor will I ever lose the habit of deferring
to them or of placing my confidence in them, so long as I consider them
as they really are, i.e. opinions in some measure doubtful, as I have just
shown, and at the same time highly probable, so that there is much more
reason to believe in than to deny them. That is why I consider that I shall
not be acting amiss, if, taking of set purpose a contrary belief, I allow
myself to be deceived, and for a certain time pretend that all these opinions
are entirely false and imaginary, until at last, having thus balanced my
former prejudices with my latter [so that they cannot divert my opinions
more to one side than to the other], my judgment will no longer be dominated
by bad usage or turned away from the right knowledge of the truth. For
I am assured that there can be neither peril nor error in this course,
and that I cannot at present yield too much to distrust, since I am not
considering the question of action, but only of knowledge.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I shall then suppose, not that God who is supremely good and the fountain
of truth, but some evil genius not less powerful than deceitful, has employed
his whole energies in deceiving me; I shall consider that the heavens,
the earth, colours, figures, sound, and all other external things are nought
but the illusions and dreams of which this genius has availed himself in
order to lay traps for my credulity; I shall consider myself as having
no hands, no eyes, no flesh, no blood, nor any senses, yet falsely believing
myself to possess all these things; I shall remain obstinately attached
to this idea, and if by this means it is not in my power to arrive at the
knowledge of any truth, I may at least do what is in my power [i.e. suspend
my judgment], and with firm purpose avoid giving credence to any false
thing, or being imposed upon by this arch deceiver, however powerful and
deceptive he may be. But this task is a laborious one, and insensibly a
certain lassitude leads me into the course of my ordinary life. And just
as a captive who in sleep enjoys an imaginary liberty, when he begins to
suspect that his liberty is but a dream, fears to awaken, and conspires
with these agreeable illusions that the deception may be prolonged, so
insensibly of my own accord I fall back into my former opinions, and I
dread awakening from this slumber, lest the laborious wakefulness which
would follow the tranquillity of this repose should have to be spent not
in daylight, but in the excessive darkness of the difficulties which have
just been discussed.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>The Meditation of yesterday filled my mind with so many doubts that
it is no longer in my power to forget them. And yet I do not see in what
manner I can resolve them; and, just as if I had all of a sudden fallen
into very deep water, I am so disconcerted that I can neither make certain
of setting my feet on the bottom, nor can I swim and so support myself
on the surface. I shall nevertheless make an effort and follow anew the
same path as that on which I yesterday entered, i.e. I shall proceed by
setting aside all that in which the least doubt could be supposed to exist,
just as if I had discovered that it was absolutely false; and I shall ever
follow in this road until I have met with something which is certain, or
at least, if I can do nothing else, until I have learned for certain that
there is nothing in the world that is certain. Archimedes, in order that
he might draw the terrestrial globe out of its place, and transport it
elsewhere, demanded only that one point should be fixed and immoveable;
in the same way I shall have the right to conceive high hopes if I am happy
enough to discover one thing only which is certain and indubitable.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I suppose, then, that all the things that I see are false; I persuade
myself that nothing has ever existed of all that my fallacious memory represents
to me. I consider that I possess no senses; I imagine that body, figure,
extension, movement and place are but the fictions of my mind. What, then,
can be esteemed as true? Perhaps nothing at all, unless that there is nothing
in the world that is certain.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But how can I know there is not something different from those things
that I have just considered, of which one cannot have the slightest doubt?
Is there not some God, or some other being by whatever name we call it,
who puts these reflections into my mind? That is not necessary, for is
it not possible that I am capable of producing them myself? I myself, am
I not at least something? But I have already denied that I had senses and
body. Yet I hesitate, for what follows from that? Am I so dependent on
body and senses that I cannot exist without these? But I was persuaded
that there was nothing in all the world, that there was no heaven, no earth,
that there were no minds, nor any bodies: was I not then likewise persuaded
that I did not exist? Not at all; of a surety I myself did exist since
I persuaded myself of something [or merely because I thought of something].
But there is some deceiver or other, very powerful and very cunning, who
ever employs his ingenuity in deceiving me. Then without doubt I exist
also if he deceives me, and let him deceive me as much as he will, he can
never cause me to be nothing so long as I think that I am something. So
that after having reflected well and carefully examined all things, we
must come to the definite conclusion that this proposition: I am, I exist,
is necessarily true each time that I pronounce it, or that I mentally conceive
it.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But I do not yet know clearly enough what I am, I who am certain that
I am; and hence I must be careful to see that I do not imprudently take
some other object in place of myself, and thus that I do not go astray
in respect of this knowledge that I hold to be the most certain and most
evident of all that I have formerly learned. That is why I shall now consider
anew what I believed myself to be before I embarked upon these last reflections;
and of my former opinions I shall withdraw all that might even in a small
degree be invalidated by the reasons which I have just brought forward,
in order that there may be nothing at all left beyond what is absolutely
certain and indubitable.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>What then did I formerly believe myself to be? Undoubtedly I believed
myself to be a man. But what is a man? Shall I say a reasonable animal?
Certainly not; for then I should have to inquire what an animal is, and
what is reasonable; and thus from a single question I should insensibly
fall into an infinitude of others more difficult; and I should not wish
to waste the little time and leisure remaining to me in trying to unravel
subtleties like these. But I shall rather stop here to consider the thoughts
which of themselves spring up in my mind, and which were not inspired by
anything beyond my own nature alone when I applied myself to the consideration
of my being. In the first place, the, I considered myself as having a face,
hands, arms, and all that system of members composed on bones and flesh
as seen in a corpse which I designated by the name of body. In addition
to this I considered that I was nourished, that I walked, that I felt,
and that I thought, and I referred all these actions to the soul: but I
did not stop to consider what the soul was, or if I did stop, I imagined
that it was something extremely rare and subtle like a wind, a flame, or
an ether, which was spread throughout my grosser parts. As to body I had
no manner of doubt about its nature, but thought I had a very clear knowledge
of it; and if I had desired to explain it according to the notions that
I had then formed of it, I should have described it thus: By the body I
understand all that which can be defined by a certain figure: something
which can be confined in a certain place, and which can fill a given space
in such a way that every other body will be excluded from it; which can
be perceived either by tough, or by sight, or by hearing, or by taste,
or by smell: which can be moved in many ways not, in truth, by itself,
but by something which is foreign to it, by which it is touched [and from
which it receives impressions]: for to have the power of self-movement,
as also of feeling or of thinking, I did not consider to appertain to the
nature of body: on the contrary, I was rather astonished to find that faculties
similar to them existed in some bodies.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But what am I, now that I suppose that there is a certain genius which
is extremely powerful, and, if I may say so, malicious, who employs all
his powers in deceiving me? Can I affirm that I possess the least of all
those things which I have just said pertain to the nature of body? I pause
to consider, I revolve all these things in my mind, and I find none of
which I can say that it pertains to me. It would be tedious to stop to
enumerate them. Let us pass to the attributes of soul and see if there
is any one which is in me? What of nutrition or walking [the first mentioned]?
But if it is so that I have no body it is also true that I can neither
walk nor take nourishment. Another attribute is sensation. But one cannot
feel without body, and besides I have thought I perceived many things during
sleep that I recognised in my waking moments as not having been experienced
at all. What of thinking? I find here that thought is an attribute that
belongs to me; it alone cannot be separated from me. I am, I exist, that
is certain. But how often? Just when I think; for it might possibly be
the case if I ceased entirely to think, that I should likewise cease altogether
to exist. I do not now admit anything which is not necessarily true: to
speak accurately I am not more than a thing which thinks, that is to say
a mind or a soul, or an understanding, or a reason, which are terms whose
significance was formerly unknown to me. I am, however, a real thing and
really exist; but what thing? I have answered: a thing which thinks.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And what more? I shall exercise my imagination [in order to see if I
am not something more]. I am not a collection of members which we call
the human body: I am not a subtle air distributed through these members,
I am not a wind, a fire, a vapour, a breath, nor anything at all which
I can imagine or conceive; because I have assumed that all these were nothing.
Without changing that supposition I find that I only leave myself certain
of the fact that I am somewhat. But perhaps it is true that these same
things which I supposed were non-existent because they are unknown to me,
are really not different from the self which I know. I am not sure about
this, I shall not dispute about it now; I can only give judgment on things
that are known to me. I know that I exist, and I inquire what I am, I whom
I know to exist. But it is very certain that the knowledge of my existence
taken in its precise significance does not depend on things whose existence
is not yet known to me; consequently it does not depend on those which
I can feign in imagination. And indeed the very term feign in imagination<sup>10</sup>
proves to me my error, for I really do this if I image myself a something,
since to imagine is nothing else than to contemplate the figure or image
of a corporeal thing. But I already know for certain that I am, and that
it may be that all these images, and, speaking generally, all things that
relate to the nature of body are nothing but dreams [and chimeras]. For
this reason I see clearly that I have as little reason to say, <i>I shall
stimulate my imagination in order to know more distinctly what I am,</i>
than if I were to say, <i>I am now awake, and I perceive somewhat that
is real and true: but because I do not yet perceive it distinctly enough,
I shall go to sleep of express purpose, so that my dreams may represent
the perception with greatest truth and evidence.</i> And, thus, I know
for certain that nothing of all that I can understand by means of my imagination
belongs to this knowledge which I have of myself, and that it is necessary
to recall the mind from this mode of thought with the utmost diligence
in order that it may be able to know its own nature with perfect distinctness.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But what then am I? A thing which thinks. What is a thing which thinks?
It is a thing which doubts, understands, [conceives], affirms, denies,
wills, refuses, which also imagines and feels.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Certainly it is no small matter if all these things pertain to my nature.
But why should they not so pertain? Am I not that being who now doubts
nearly everything, who nevertheless understands certain things, who affirms
that one only is true, who denies all the others, who desires to know more,
is averse from being deceived, who imagines many things, sometimes indeed
despite his will, and who perceives many likewise, as by the intervention
of the bodily organs? Is there nothing in all this which is as true as
it is certain that I exist, even though I should always sleep and though
he who has given me being employed all his ingenuity in deceiving me? Is
there likewise any one of these attributes which can be distinguished from
my thought, or which might be said to be separated from myself? For it
is so evident of itself that it is I who doubts, who understands, and who
desires, that there is no reason here to add anything to explain it. And
I have certainly the power of imagining likewise; for although it may happen
(as I formerly supposed) that none of the things which I imagine are true,
nevertheless this power of imagining does not cease to be really in use,
and it forms part of my thought. Finally, I am the same who feels, that
is to say, who perceives certain things, as by the organs of sense, since
it truth I see light, I hear noise, I feel heat. But it will be said that
these phenomena are false and that I am dreaming. Let it be so; still it
is at least quite certain that it seems to me that I see light, that I
hear noise and that I feel heat. That cannot be false; properly speaking
it is what is in me called feeling;<sup>11</sup> and used in this precise
sense that is no other thing than thinking.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>From this time I begin to know what I am with a little more clearness
and distinction than before; but nevertheless it still seems to me, and
I cannot prevent myself from thinking, that corporeal things, whose images
are framed by thought, which are tested by the senses, are much more distinctly
known than that obscure part of me which does not come under the imagination.
Although really it is very strange to say that I know and understand more
distinctly these things whose existence seems to me dubious, which are
unknown to me, and which do not belong to me, than others of the truth
of which I am convinced, which are known to me and which pertain to my
real nature, in a word, than myself. But I see clearly how the case stands:
my mind loves to wander, and cannot yet suffer itself to be retained within
the just limits of truth. Very good, let us once more give it the freest
rein, so that, when afterwards we seize the proper occasion for pulling
up, it may the more easily be regulated and controlled.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Let us begin by considering the commonest matters, those which we believe
to be the most distinctly comprehended, to wit, the bodies which we touch
and see; not indeed bodies in general, for these general ideas are usually
a little more confused, but let us consider one body in particular. Let
us take, for example, this piece of wax: it has been taken quite freshly
from the hive, and it has not yet lost the sweetness of the honey which
it contains; it still retains somewhat of the odour of the flowers from
which it has been culled; its colour, its figure, its size are apparent;
it is hard, cold, easily handled, and if you strike it with the finger,
it will emit a sound. Finally all the things which are requisite to cause
us distinctly to recognise a body, are met with in it. But notice that
while I speak and approach the fire what remained of the taste is exhaled,
the smell evaporates, the colour alters, the figure is destroyed, the size
increases, it becomes liquid, it heats, scarcely can one handle it, and
when one strikes it, now sound is emitted. Does the same wax remain after
this change? We must confess that it remains; none would judge otherwise.
What then did I know so distinctly in this piece of wax? It could certainly
be nothing of all that the senses brought to my notice, since all these
things which fall under taste, smell, sight, touch, and hearing, are found
to be changed, and yet the same wax remains.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Perhaps it was what I now think, viz. that this wax was not that sweetness
of honey, nor that agreeable scent of flowers, nor that particular whiteness,
nor that figure, nor that sound, but simply a body which a little while
before appeared tome as perceptible under these forms, and which is now
perceptible under others. But what, precisely, is it that I imagine when
I form such conceptions? Let us attentively consider this, and, abstracting
from all that does not belong to the wax, let us see what remains. Certainly
nothing remains excepting a certain extended thing which is flexible and
movable. But what is the meaning of flexible and movable? Is it not that
I imagine that this piece of wax being round is capable of becoming square
and of passing from a square to a triangular figure? No, certainly it is
not that, since I imagine it admits of an infinitude of similar changes,
and I nevertheless do not know how to compass the infinitude by my imagination,
and consequently this conception which I have of the wax is not brought
about by the faculty of imagination. What now is this extension? Is it
not also unknown? For it becomes greater when the wax is melted, greater
when it is boiled, and greater still when the heat increases; and I should
not conceive [clearly] according to truth what wax is, if I did not think
that even this piece that we are considering is capable of receiving more
variations in extension than I have ever imagined. We must then grant that
I could not even understand through the imagination what this piece of
wax is, and that it is my mind<sup>12</sup> alone which perceives it. I
say this piece of wax in particular, for as to wax in general it is yet
clearer. But what is this piece of wax which cannot be understood excepting
by the [understanding or] mind? It is certainly the same that I see, touch,
imagine, and finally it is the same which I have always believed it to
be from the beginning. But what must particularly be observed is that its
perception is neither an act of vision, nor of touch, nor of imagination,
and has never been such although it may have appeared formerly to be so,
but only an intuition<sup>13</sup> of the mind, which may be imperfect
and confused as it was formerly, or clear and distinct as it is at present,
according as my attention is more or less directed to the elements which
are found in it, and of which it is composed.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Yet in the meantime I am greatly astonished when I consider [the great
feebleness of mind] and its proneness to fall [insensibly] into error;
for although without giving expression to my thought I consider all this
in my own mind, words often impede me and I am almost deceived by the terms
of ordinary language. For we say that we see the same wax, if it is present,
and not that we simply judge that it is the same from its having the same
colour and figure. From this I should conclude that I knew the wax by means
of vision and not simply by the intuition of the mind; unless by chance
I remember that, when looking from a window and saying I see men who pass
in the street, I really do not see them, but infer that what I see is men,
just as I say that I see wax. And yet what do I see from the window but
hats and coats which may cover automatic machines? Yet I judge these to
be men. And similarly solely by the faculty of judgment which rests in
my mind, I comprehend that which I believed I saw with my eyes.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>A man who makes it his aim to raise his knowledge above the common should
be ashamed to derive the occasion for doubting from the forms of speech
invented by the vulgar; I prefer to pass on and consider whether I had
a more evident and perfect conception of what the wax was when I first
perceived it, and when I believed I knew it by means of the external senses
or at least by the common sense<sup>14</sup> as it is called, that is to
say by the imaginative faculty, or whether my present conception is clearer
now that I have most carefully examined what it is, and in what way it
can be known. It would certainly be absurd to doubt as to this. For what
was there in this first perception which was distinct? What was there which
might not as well have been perceived by any of the animals? But when I
distinguish the wax from its external forms, and when, just as if I had
taken from it its vestments, I consider it quite naked, it is certain that
although some error may still be found in my judgment, I can nevertheless
not perceive it thus without a human mind.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But finally what shall I say of this mind, that is, of myself, for up
to this point I do not admit in myself anything but mind? What then, I
who seem to perceive this piece of wax so distinctly, do I not know myself,
not only with much more truth and certainty, but also with much more distinctness
and clearness? For if I judge that the wax is or exists from the fact that
I see it, it certainly follows much more clearly that I am or that I exist
myself from the fact that I see it. For it may be that what I see is not
really wax, it may also be that I do not possess eyes with which to see
anything; but it cannot be that when I see, or (for I no longer take account
of the distinction) when I think I see, that I myself who think am nought.
So if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I touch it, the same
thing will follow, to wit, that I am; and if I judge that my imagination,
or some other cause, whatever it is, persuades me that the wax exists,
I shall still conclude the same. And what I have here remarked of wax may
be applied to all other things which are external to me [and which are
met with outside of me]. And further, if the [notion or] perception of
wax has seemed to me clearer and more distinct, not only after the sight
or the touch, but also after many other causes have rendered it quite manifest
to me, with how much more [evidence] and distinctness must it be said that
I now know myself, since all the reasons which contribute to the knowledge
of wax, or any other body whatever, are yet better proofs of the nature
of my mind! And there are so many other things in the mind itself which
may contribute to the elucidation of its nature, that those which depend
on body such as these just mentioned, hardly merit being taken into account.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But finally here I am, having insensibly reverted to the point I desired,
for, since it is now manifest to me that even bodies are not properly speaking
known by the senses or by the faculty of imagination, but by the understanding
only, and since they are not known from the fact that they are seen or
touched, but only because they are understood, I see clearly that there
is nothing which is easier for me to know than my mind. But because it
is difficult to rid oneself so promptly of an opinion to which one was
accustomed for so long, it will be well that I should halt a little at
this point, so that by the length of my meditation I may more deeply imprint
on my memory this new knowledge.</b></dd>

<b>I have been well accustomed these past days to detach my mind from my
senses, and I have accurately observed that there are very few things that
one knows with certainty respecting corporeal objects, that there are many
more which are known to us respecting the human mind, and yet more still
regarding God Himself; so that I shall now without any difficulty abstract
my thoughts from the consideration of [sensible or] imaginable objects,
and carry them to those which, being withdrawn from all contact with matter,
are purely intelligible. And certainly the idea which I possess of the
human mind inasmuch as it is a thinking thing, and not extended in length,
width and depth, nor participating in anything pertaining to body, is incomparably
more distinct than is the idea of any corporeal thing. And when I consider
that I doubt, that is to say, that I am an incomplete and dependent being,
the idea of a being that is complete and independent, that is of God, presents
itself to my mind with so much distinctness and clearness -- and from the
fact alone that this idea is found in me, or that I who possess this idea
exist, I conclude so certainly that God exists, and that my existence depends
entirely on Him in every moment of my life -- that I do not think that
the human mind is capable of knowing anything with more evidence and certitude.
And it seems to me that I now have before me a road which will lead us
from the contemplation of the true God (in whom all the treasures of science
and wisdom are contained) to the knowledge of the other objects of the
universe.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>For, first of all, I recognise it to be impossible that He should ever
deceive me; for in all fraud and deception some imperfection is to be found,
and although it may appear that the power of deception is a mark of subtilty
or power, yet the desire to deceive without doubt testifies to malice or
feebleness, and accordingly cannot be found in God.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In the next place I experienced in myself a certain capacity for judging
which I have doubtless received from God, like all the other things that
I possess; and as He could not desire to deceive me, it is clear that He
has not given me a faculty that will lead me to err if I use it aright.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And no doubt respecting this matter could remain, if it were not that
the consequence would seem to follow that I can thus never be deceived;
for if I hold all that I possess from God, and if He has not placed in
me the capacity for error, it seems as though I could never fall into error.
And it is true that when I think only of God [and direct my mind wholly
to Him],<sup>18</sup> I discover [in myself] no cause of error, or falsity;
yet directly afterwards, when recurring to myself, experience shows me
that I am nevertheless subject to an infinitude of errors, as to which,
when we come to investigate them more closely, I notice that not only is
there a real and positive idea of God or of a Being of supreme perfection
present to my mind, but also, so to speak, a certain negative idea of nothing,
that is, of that which is infinitely removed from any kind of perfection;
and that I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought,
i.e. placed in such a manner between the supreme Being and non-being, that
there is in truth nothing in me that can lead to error in so far as a sovereign
Being has formed me; but that, as I in some degree participate likewise
in nought or in non-being, i.e. in so far as I am not myself the supreme
Being, and as I find myself subject to an infinitude of imperfections,
I ought not to be astonished if I should fall into error. Thus do I recognise
that error, in so far as it is such, is not a real thing depending on God,
but simply a defect; and therefore, in order to fall into it, that I have
no need to possess a special faculty given me by God for this very purpose,
but that I fall into error from the fact that the power given me by God
for the purpose of distinguishing truth from error is not infinite.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Nevertheless this does not quite satisfy me; for error is not a pure
negation [i.e. is not the dimple defect or want of some perfection which
ought not to be mine], but it is a lack of some knowledge which it seems
that I ought to possess. And on considering the nature of God it does not
appear to me possible that He should have given me a faculty which is not
perfect of its kind, that is, which is wanting in some perfection due to
it. For if it is true that the more skilful the artizan, the more perfect
is the work of his hands, what can have been produced by this supreme Creator
of all things that is not in all its parts perfect? And certainly there
is no doubt that God could have created me so that I could never have been
subject to error; it is also certain that He ever wills what is best; is
it then better that I should be subject to err than that I should not?</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In considering this more attentively, it occurs to me in the first place
that I should not be astonished if my intelligence is not capable of comprehending
why God acts as He does; and that there is thus no reason to doubt of His
existence from the fact that I may perhaps find many other things besides
this as to which I am able to understand neither for what reason nor how
God has produced them. For, in the first place, knowing that my nature
is extremely feeble and limited, and that the nature of God is on the contrary
immense, incomprehensible, and infinite, I have no further difficulty in
recognising that there is an infinitude of matter in His power, the causes
of which transcend my knowledge; and this reason suffices to convince me
that the species of cause termed final, finds no useful employment in physical
[or natural] things; for it does not appear to me that I can without temerity
seek to investigate the [inscrutable] ends of God.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>It further occurs to me that we should not consider one single creature
separately, when we inquire as to whether the works of God are perfect,
but should regard all his creations together. For the same thing which
might possibly seem very imperfect with some semblance of reason if regarded
by itself, is found to be very perfect if regarded as part of the whole
universe; and although, since I resolved to doubt all things, I as yet
have only known certainly my own existence and that of God, nevertheless
since I have recognised the infinite power of God, I cannot deny that He
may have produced many other things, or at least that He has the power
of producing them, so that I may obtain a place as a part of a great universe.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Whereupon, regarding myself more closely, and considering what are my
errors (for they alone testify to there being any imperfection in me),
I answer that they depend on a combination of two causes, to wit, on the
faculty of knowledge that rests in me, and on the power of choice or of
free will -- that is to say, of the understanding and at the same time
of the will. For by the understanding alone I [neither assert nor deny
anything, but] apprehend<sup>19</sup> the ideas of things as to which I
can form a judgment. But no error is properly speaking found in it, provided
the word error is taken in its proper signification; and though there is
possibly an infinitude of things in the world of which I have no idea in
my understanding, we cannot for all that say that it is deprived of these
ideas [as we might say of something which is required by its nature], but
simply it does not possess these; because in truth there is no reason to
prove that God should have given me a greater faculty of knowledge than
He has given me; and however skillful a workman I represent Him to be,
I should not for all that consider that He was bound to have placed in
each of His works all the perfections which He may have been able to place
in some. I likewise cannot complain that God has not given me a free choice
or a will which is sufficient, ample and perfect, since as a matter of
fact I am conscious of a will so extended as to be subject to no limits.
And what seems to me very remarkable in this regard is that of all the
qualities which I possess there is no one so perfect and so comprehensive
that I do not very clearly recognise that it might be yet greater and more
perfect. For, to take an example, if I consider the faculty of comprehension
which I possess, I find that it is of very small extent and extremely limited,
and at the same time I find the idea of another faculty much more ample
and even infinite, and seeing that I can form the idea of it, I recognise
from this very fact that it pertains to the nature of God. If in the same
way I examine the memory, the imagination, or some other faculty, I do
not find any which is not small and circumscribed, while in God it is immense
[or infinite]. It is free-will alone or liberty of choice which I find
to be so great in me that I can conceive no other idea to be more great;
it is indeed the case that it is for the most part this will that causes
me to know that in some manner I bear the image and similitude of God.
For although the power of will is incomparably greater in God than in me,
both by reason of the knowledge and the power which, conjoined with it,
render it stronger and more efficacious, and by reason of its object, inasmuch
as in God it extends to a great many things; it nevertheless does not seem
to me greater if I consider it formally and precisely in itself: for the
faculty of will consists alone in our having the power of choosing to do
a thing or choosing not to do it (that is, to affirm or deny, to pursue
or to shun it), or rather it consists alone in the fact that in order to
affirm or deny, pursue or shun those things placed before us by the understanding,
we act so that we are unconscious that any outside force constrains us
in doing so. For in order that I should be free it is not necessary that
I should be indifferent as to the choice of one or the other of two contraries;
but contrariwise the more I lean to the one -- whether I recognise clearly
that the reasons of the good and true are to be found in it, or whether
God so disposes my inward thought -- the more freely do I choose and embrace
it. And undoubtedly both divine grace and natural knowledge, far from diminishing
my liberty, rather increase it and strengthen it. Hence this indifference
which I feel, when I am not swayed to one side rather than to the other
by lack of reason, is the lowest grade of liberty, and rather evinces a
lack or negation in knowledge than a perfection of will: for if I always
recognised clearly what was true and good, I should never have trouble
in deliberating as to what judgment or choice I should make, and then I
should be entirely free without ever being indifferent.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>From all this I recognise that the power of will which I have received
from God is not of itself the source of my errors -- for it is very ample
and very perfect of its kind -- any more than is the power of understanding;
for since I understand nothing but by the power which God has given me
for understanding, there is no doubt that all that I understand, I understand
as I ought, and it is not possible that I err in this. Whence then come
my errors? They come from the sole fact that since the will is much wider
in its range and compass than the understanding, I do not restrain it within
the same bounds, but extend it also to things which I do not understand:
and as the will is of itself indifferent to these, it easily falls into
error and sin, and chooses the evil for the good, or the false for the
true.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>For example, when I lately examined whether anything existed in the
world, and found that from the very fact that I considered this question
it followed very clearly that I myself existed, I could not prevent myself
from believing that a thing I so clearly conceived was true: not that I
found myself compelled to do so by some external cause, but simply because
from great clearness in my mind there followed a great inclination of my
will; and I believed this with so much the greater freedom or spontaneity
as I possessed the less indifference towards it. Now, on the contrary,
I not only know that I exist, inasmuch as I am a thinking thing, but a
certain representation of corporeal nature is also presented to my mind;
and it comes to pass that I doubt whether this thinking nature which is
in me, or rather by which I am what I am, differs from this corporeal nature,
or whether both are not simply the same thing; and I here suppose that
I do not yet know any reason to persuade me to adopt the one belief rather
than the other. From this it follows that I am entirely indifferent as
to which of the two I affirm or deny, or even whether I abstain from forming
any judgment in the matter.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And this indifference does not only extend to matters as to which the
understanding has no knowledge, but also in general to all those which
are not apprehended with perfect clearness at the moment when the will
is deliberating upon them: for, however probable are the conjectures which
render me disposed to form a judgment respecting anything, the simple knowledge
that I have that those are conjectures alone and not certain and indubitable
reasons, suffices to occasion me to judge the contrary. Of this I have
had great experience of late when I set aside as false all that I had formerly
held to be absolutely true, for the sole reason that I remarked that it
might in some measure be doubted.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But if I abstain from giving my judgment on any thing when I do not
perceive it with sufficient clearness and distinctness, it is plain that
I act rightly and am not deceived. But if I determine to deny or affirm,
I no longer make use as I should of my free will, and if I affirm what
is not true, it is evident that I deceive myself; even though I judge according
to truth, this comes about only by chance, and I do not escape the blame
of misusing my freedom; for the light of nature teaches us that the knowledge
of the understanding should always precede the determination of the will.
And it is in the misuse of the free will that the privation which constitutes
the characteristic nature of error is met with. Privation, I say, is found
in the act, in so far as it proceeds from me, but it is not found in the
faculty which I have received from God, nor even in the act in so far as
it depends on Him.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>For I have certainly no cause to complain that God has not given me
an intelligence which is more powerful, or a natural light which is stronger
than that which I have received from Him, since it is proper to the finite
understanding not to comprehend a multitude of things, and it is proper
to a created understanding to be finite; on the contrary, I have every
reason to render thanks to God who owes me nothing and who has given me
all the perfections I possess, and I should be far from charging Him with
injustice, and with having deprived me of, or wrongfully withheld from
me, these perfections which He has not bestowed upon me.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I have further no reason to complain that He has given me a will more
ample than my understanding, for since the will consists only of one single
element, and is so to speak indivisible, it appears that its nature is
such that nothing can be abstracted from it [without destroying it]; and
certainly the more comprehensive it is found to be, the more reason I have
to render gratitude to the giver.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And, finally, I must also not complain that God concurs with me in forming
the acts of the will, that is the judgment in which I go astray, because
these acts are entirely true and good, inasmuch as they depend on God;
and in a certain sense more perfection accrues to my nature from the fact
that I can form them, than if I could not do so. As to the privation in
which alone the formal reason of error or sin consists, it has no need
of any concurrence from God, since it is not a thing [or an existence],
and since it is not related to God as to a cause, but should be termed
merely a negation [according to the significance given to these words in
the Schools]. For in fact it is not an imperfection in God that He has
given me the liberty to give or withhold my assent from certain things
as to which He has not placed a clear and distinct knowledge in my understanding;
but it is without doubt an imperfection in me not to make a good use of
my freedom, and to give my judgment readily on matters which I only understand
obscurely. I nevertheless perceive that God could easily have created me
so that I never should err, although I still remained free, and endowed
with a limited knowledge, viz. by giving to my understanding a clear and
distinct intelligence of all things as to which I should ever have to deliberate;
or simply by His engraving deeply in my memory the resolution never to
form a judgment on anything without having a clear and distinct understanding
of it, so that I could never forget it. And it is easy for me to understand
that, in so far as I consider myself alone, and as if there were only myself
in the world, I should have been much more perfect than I am, if God had
created me so that I could never err. Nevertheless I cannot deny that in
some sense it is a greater perfection in the whole universe that certain
parts should not be exempt from error as others are than that all parts
should be exactly similar. And I have no right to complain if God, having
placed me in the world, has not called upon me to play a part that excels
all others in distinction and perfection.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And further I have reason to be glad on the ground that if He has not
given me the power of never going astray by the first means pointed out
above, which depends on a clear and evident knowledge of all the things
regarding which I can deliberate, He has at least left within my power
the other means, which is firmly to adhere to the resolution never to give
judgment on matters whose truth is not clearly known to me; for although
I notice a certain weakness in my nature in that I cannot continually concentrate
my mind on one single thought, I can yet, by attentive and frequently repeated
meditation, impress it so forcibly on my memory that I shall never fail
to recollect it whenever I have need of it, and thus acquire the habit
of never going astray.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And inasmuch as it is in this that the greatest and principal perfection
of man consists, it seems to me that I have not gained little by this day's
Meditation, since I have discovered the source of falsity and error. And
certainly there can be no other source than that which I have explained;
for as often as I so restrain my will within the limits of my knowledge
that it forms no judgment except on matters which are clearly and distinctly
represented to it by the understanding, I can never be deceived; for every
clear and distinct conception<sup>20</sup> is without doubt something,
and hence cannot derive its origin from what is nought, but must of necessity
have God as its author -- God, I say, who being supremely perfect, cannot
be the cause of any error; and consequently we must conclude that such
a conception [or such a judgment] is true. Nor have I only learned to-day
what I should avoid in order that I may not err, but also how I should
act in order to arrive at a knowledge of the truth; for without doubt I
shall arrive at this end if I devote my attention sufficiently to those
things which I perfectly understand; and if I separate from these that
which I only understand confusedly and with obscurity. To these I shall
henceforth diligently give heed.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Many other matters respecting the attributes of God and my own nature
or mind remain for consideration; but I shall possibly on another occasion
resume the investigation of these. Now (after first noting what must be
done or avoided, in order to arrive at a knowledge of the truth) my principal
task is to endeavour to emerge from the state of doubt into which I have
these last days fallen, and to see whether nothing certain can be known
regarding material things.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But before examining whether any such objects as I conceive exist outside
of me, I must consider the ideas of them in so far as they are in my thought,
and see which of them are distinct and which confused.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In the first place, I am able distinctly to imagine that quantity which
philosophers commonly call continuous, or the extension in length, breadth,
or depth, that is in this quantity, or rather in the object to which it
is attributed. Further, I can number in it many different parts, and attribute
to each of its parts many sorts of size, figure, situation and local movement,
and, finally, I can assign to each of these movements all degrees of duration.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And not only do I know these things with distinctness when I consider
them in general, but, likewise [however little I apply my attention to
the matter], I discover an infinitude of particulars respecting numbers,
figures, movements, and other such things, whose truth is so manifest,
and so well accords with my nature, that when I begin to discover them,
it seems to me that I learn nothing new, or recollect what I formerly knew
-- that is to say, that I for the first time perceive things which were
already present to my mind, although I had not as yet applied my mind to
them.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And what I here find to be most important is that I discover in myself
an infinitude of ideas of certain things which cannot be esteemed as pure
negations, although they may possibly have no existence outside of my thought,
and which are not framed by me, although it is within my power either to
think or not to think them, but which possess natures which are true and
immutable. For example, when I imagine a triangle, although there may nowhere
in the world be such a figure outside my thought, or ever have been, there
is nevertheless in this figure a certain determinate nature, form, or essence,
which is immutable and eternal, which I have not invented, and which in
no wise depends on my mind, as appears from the fact that diverse properties
of that triangle can be demonstrated, viz. that its three angles are equal
to two right angles, that the greatest side is subtended by the greatest
angle, and the like, which now, whether I wish it or do not wish it, I
recognise very clearly as pertaining to it, although I never thought of
the matter at all when I imagined a triangle for the first time, and which
therefore cannot be said to have been invented by me.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Nor does the objection hold good that possibly this idea of a triangle
has reached my mind through the medium of my senses, since I have sometimes
seen bodies triangular in shape; because I can form in my mind an infinitude
of other figures regarding which we cannot have the least conception of
their ever having been objects of sense, and I can nevertheless demonstrate
various properties pertaining to their nature as well as to that of the
triangle, and these must certainly all be true since I conceive them clearly.
Hence they are something, and not pure negation; for it is perfectly clear
that all that is true is something, and I have already fully demonstrated
that all that I know clearly is true. And even although I had not demonstrated
this, the nature of my mind is such that I could not prevent myself from
holding them to be true so long as I conceive them clearly; and I recollect
that even when I was still strongly attached to the objects of sense, I
counted as the most certain those truths which I conceived clearly as regards
figures, numbers, and the other matters which pertain to arithmetic and
geometry, and, in general, to pure and abstract mathematics.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But now, if just because I can draw the idea of something from my thought,
it follows that all which I know clearly and distinctly as pertaining to
this object does really belong to it, may I not derive from this an argument
demonstrating the existence of God? It is certain that I no less find the
idea of God, that is to say, the idea of a supremely perfect Being, in
me, than that of any figure or number whatever it is; and I do not know
any less clearly and distinctly that an [actual and] eternal existence
pertains to this nature than I know that all that which I am able to demonstrate
of some figure or number truly pertains to the nature of this figure or
number, and therefore, although all that I concluded in the preceding Meditations
were found to be false, the existence of God would pass with me as at least
as certain as I have ever held the truths of mathematics (which concern
only numbers and figures) to be.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>This indeed is not at first manifest, since it would seem to present
some appearance of being a sophism. For being accustomed in all other things
to make a distinction between existence and essence, I easily persuade
myself that the existence can be separated from the essence of God, and
that we can thus conceive God as not actually existing. But, nevertheless,
when I think of it with more attention, I clearly see that existence can
no more be separated from the essence of God than can its having its three
angles equal to two right angles be separated from the essence of a [rectilinear]
triangle, or the idea of a mountain from the idea of a valley; and so there
is not any less repugnance to our conceiving a God (that is, a Being supremely
perfect) to whom existence is lacking (that is to say, to whom a certain
perfection is lacking), than to conceive of a mountain which has no valley.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But although I cannot really conceive of a God without existence any
more than a mountain without a valley, still from the fact that I conceive
of a mountain with a valley, it does not follow that there is such a mountain
in the world; similarly although I conceive of God as possessing existence,
it would seem that it does not follow that there is a God which exists;
for my thought does not impose any necessity upon things, and just as I
may imagine a winged horse, although no horse with wings exists, so I could
perhaps attribute existence to God, although no God existed.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But a sophism is concealed in this objection; for from the fact that
I cannot conceive a mountain without a valley, it does not follow that
there is any mountain or any valley in existence, but only that the mountain
and the valley, whether they exist or do not exist, cannot in any way be
separated one from the other. While from the fact that I cannot conceive
God without existence, it follows that existence is inseparable from Him,
and hence that He really exists; not that my thought can bring this to
pass, or impose any necessity on things, but, on the contrary, because
the necessity which lies in the thing itself, i.e. the necessity of the
existence of God determines me to think in this way. For it is not within
my power to think of God without existence (that is of a supremely perfect
Being devoid of a supreme perfection) though it is in my power to imagine
a horse either with wings or without wings.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And we must not here object that it is in truth necessary for me to
assert that God exists after having presupposed that He possesses every
sort of perfection, since existence is one of these, but that as a matter
of fact my original supposition was not necessary, just as it is not necessary
to consider that all quadrilateral figures can be inscribed in the circle;
for supposing I thought this, I should be constrained to admit that the
rhombus might be inscribed in the circle since it is a quadrilateral figure,
which, however, is manifestly false. [We must not, I say, make any such
allegations because] although it is not necessary that I should at any
time entertain the notion of God, nevertheless whenever it happens that
I think of a first and a sovereign Being, and, so to speak, derive the
idea of Him from the storehouse of my mind, it is necessary that I should
attribute to Him every sort of perfection, although I do not get so far
as to enumerate them all, or to apply my mind to each one in particular.
And this necessity suffices to make me conclude (after having recognised
that existence is a perfection) that this first and sovereign Being really
exists; just as though it is not necessary for me ever to imagine any triangle,
yet, whenever I wish to consider a rectilinear figure composed only of
three angles, it is absolutely essential that I should attribute to it
all those properties which serve to bring about the conclusion that its
three angles are not greater than two right angles, even although I may
not then be considering this point in particular. But when I consider which
figures are capable of being inscribed in the circle, it is in no wise
necessary that I should think that all quadrilateral figures are of this
number; on the contrary, I cannot even pretend that this is the case, so
long as I do not desire to accept anything which I cannot conceive clearly
and distinctly. And in consequence there is a great difference between
the false suppositions such as this, and the true ideas born within me,
the first and principal of which is that of God. For really I discern in
many ways that this idea is not something factitious, and depending solely
on my thought, but that it is the image of a true and immutable nature;
first of all, because I cannot conceive anything but God himself to whose
essence existence [necessarily] pertains; in the second place because it
is not possible for me to conceive two or more Gods in this same position;
and, granted that there is one such God who now exists, I see clearly that
it is necessary that He should have existed from all eternity, and that
He must exist eternally; and finally, because I know an infinitude of other
properties in God, none of which I can either diminish or change.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>For the rest, whatever proof or argument I avail myself of, we must
always return to the point that it is only those things which we conceive
clearly and distinctly that have the power of persuading me entirely. And
although amongst the matters which I conceive of in this way, some indeed
are manifestly obvious to all, while others only manifest themselves to
those who consider them closely and examine them attentively; still, after
they have once been discovered, the latter are not esteemed as any less
certain than the former. For example, in the case of every right-angled
triangle, although it does not so manifestly appear that the square of
the base is equal to the squares of the two other sides as that this base
is opposite to the greatest angle; still, when this has once been apprehended,
we are just as certain of its truth as of the truth of the other. And as
regards God, if my mind were not pre-occupied with prejudices, and if my
thought did not find itself on all hands diverted by the continual pressure
of sensible things, there would be nothing which I could know more immediately
and more easily than Him. For is there anything more manifest than that
there is a God, that is to say, a Supreme Being, to whose essence alone
existence pertains?<sup>21</sup></b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And although for a firm grasp of this truth I have need of a strenuous
application of mind, at present I not only feel myself to be as assured
of it as of all that I hold as most certain, but I also remark that the
certainty of all other things depends on it so absolutely, that without
this knowledge it is impossible ever to know anything perfectly.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>For although I am of such a nature that as long as<sup>22</sup> I understand
anything very clearly and distinctly, I am naturally impelled to believe
it to be true, yet because I am also of such a nature that I cannot have
my mind constantly fixed on the same object in order to perceive it clearly,
and as I often recollect having formed a past judgment without at the same
time properly recollecting the reasons that led me to make it, it may happen
meanwhile that other reasons present themselves to me, which would easily
cause me to change my opinion, if I were ignorant of the facts of the existence
of God, and thus I should have no true and certain knowledge, but only
vague and vacillating opinions. Thus, for example, when I consider the
nature of a [rectilinear] triangle, I who have some little knowledge of
the principles of geometry recognise quite clearly that the three angles
are equal to two right angles, and it is not possible for me not to believe
this so long as I apply my mind to its demonstration; but so soon as I
abstain from attending to the proof, although I still recollect having
clearly comprehended it, it may easily occur that I come to doubt its truth,
if I am ignorant of there being a God. For I can persuade myself of having
been so constituted by nature that I can easily deceive myself even in
those matters which I believe myself to apprehend with the greatest evidence
and certainty, especially when I recollect that I have frequently judged
matters to be true and certain which other reasons have afterwards impelled
me to judge to be altogether false.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But after I have recognised that there is a God -- because at the same
time I have also recognised that all things depend upon Him, and that He
is not a deceiver, and from that have inferred that what I perceive clearly
and distinctly cannot fail to be true -- although I no longer pay attention
to the reasons for which I have judged this to be true, provided that I
recollect having clearly and distinctly perceived it no contrary reason
can be brought forward which could ever cause me to doubt of its truth;
and thus I have a true and certain knowledge of it. And this same knowledge
extends likewise to all other things which I recollect having formerly
demonstrated, such as the truths of geometry and the like; for what can
be alleged against them to cause me to place them in doubt? Will it be
said that my nature is such as to cause me to be frequently deceived? But
I already know that I cannot be deceived in the judgment whose grounds
I know clearly. Will it be said that I formerly held many things to be
true and certain which I have afterwards recognised to be false? But I
had not had any clear and distinct knowledge of these things, and not as
yet knowing the rule whereby I assure myself of the truth, I had been impelled
to give my assent from reasons which I have since recognised to be less
strong than I had at the time imagined them to be. What further objection
can then be raised? That possibly I am dreaming (an objection I myself
made a little while ago), or that all the thoughts which I now have are
no more true than the phantasies of my dreams? But even though I slept
the case would be the same, for all that is clearly present to my mind
is absolutely true.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And so I very clearly recognise that the certainty and truth of all
knowledge depends alone on the knowledge of the true God, in so much that,
before I knew Him, I could not have a perfect knowledge of any other thing.
And now that I know Him I have the means of acquiring a perfect knowledge
of an infinitude of things, not only of those which relate to God Himself
and other intellectual matters, but also of those which pertain to corporeal
nature in so far as it is the object of pure mathematics [which have no
concern with whether it exists or not].</b></dd>

<b>Nothing further now remains but to inquire whether material things exist.
And certainly I at least know that these may exist in so far as they are
considered as the objects of pure mathematics, since in this aspect I perceive
them clearly and distinctly. For there is no doubt that God possesses the
power to produce everything that I am capable of perceiving with distinctness,
and I have never deemed that anything was impossible for Him, unless I
found a contradiction in attempting to conceive it clearly. Further, the
faculty of imagination which I possess, and of which, experience tells
me, I make use when I apply myself to the consideration of material things,
is capable of persuading me of their existence; for when I attentively
consider what imagination is, I find that it is nothing but a certain application
of the faculty of knowledge to the body which is immediately present to
it, and which therefore exists.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And to render this quite clear, I remark in the first place the difference
that exists between the imagination and pure intellection [or conception<sup>23</sup>
]. For example, when I imagine a triangle, I do not conceive it only as
a figure comprehended by three lines, but I also apprehend<sup>24</sup>
these three lines as present by the power and inward vision of my mind,<sup>25</sup>
and this is what I call imagining. But if I desire to think of a chiliagon,
I certainly conceive truly that it is a figure composed of a thousand sides,
just as easily as I conceive of a triangle that it is a figure of three
sides only; but I cannot in any way imagine the thousand sides of a chiliagon
[as I do the three sides of a triangle], nor do I, so to speak, regard
them as present [with the eyes of my mind]. And although in accordance
with the habit I have formed of always employing the aid of my imagination
when I think of corporeal things, it may happen that in imagining a chiliagon
I confusedly represent to myself some figure, yet it is very evident that
this figure is not a chiliagon, since it in no way differs from that which
I represent to myself when I think of a myriagon or any other many-sided
figure; nor does it serve my purpose in discovering the properties which
go to form the distinction between a chiliagon and other polygons. But
if the question turns upon a pentagon, it is quite true that I can conceive
its figure as well as that of a chiliagon without the help of my imagination;
but I can also imagine it by applying the attention of my mind to each
of its five sides, and at the same time to the space which they enclose.
And thus I clearly recognise that I have need of a particular effort of
mind in order to effect the act of imagination, such as I do not require
in order to understand, and this particular effort of mind clearly manifests
the difference which exists between imagination and pure intellection.<sup>26</sup></b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I remark besides that this power of imagination which is in one, inasmuch
as it differs from the power of understanding, is in no wise a necessary
element in my nature, or in [my essence, that is to say, in] the essence
of my mind; for although I did not possess it I should doubtless ever remain
the same as I now am, from which it appears that we might conclude that
it depends on something which differs from me. And I easily conceive that
if some body exists with which my mind is conjoined and united in such
a way that it can apply itself to consider it when it pleases, it may be
that by this means it can imagine corporeal objects; so that this mode
of thinking differs from pure intellection only inasmuch as mind in its
intellectual activity in some manner turns on itself, and considers some
of the ideas which it possesses in itself; while in imagining it turns
towards the body, and there beholds in it something conformable to the
idea which it has either conceived of itself or perceived by the senses.
I easily understand, I say, that the imagination could be thus constituted
if it is true that body exists; and because I can discover no other convenient
mode of explaining it, I conjecture with probability that body does exist;
but this is only with probability, and although I examine all things with
care, I nevertheless do not find that from this distinct idea of corporeal
nature, which I have in my imagination, I can derive any argument from
which there will necessarily be deduced the existence of body.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But I am in the habit of imagining many other things besides this corporeal
nature which is the object of pure mathematics, to wit, the colours, sounds,
scents, pain, and other such things, although less distinctly. And inasmuch
as I perceive these things much better through the senses, by the medium
of which, and by the memory, they seem to have reached my imagination,
I believe that, in order to examine them more conveniently, it is right
that I should at the same time investigate the nature of sense perception,
and that I should see if from the ideas which I apprehend by this mode
of thought, which I call feeling, I cannot derive some certain proof of
the existence of corporeal objects.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And first of all I shall recall to my memory those matters which I hitherto
held to be true, as having perceived them through the senses, and the foundations
on which my belief has rested; in the next place I shall examine the reasons
which have since obliged me to place them in doubt; in the last place I
shall consider which of them I must now believe.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>First of all, then, I perceived that I had a head, hands, feet, and
all other members of which this body -- which I considered as a part, or
possibly even as the whole, of myself -- is composed. Further I was sensible
that this body was placed amidst many others, from which it was capable
of being affected in many different ways, beneficial and hurtful, and I
remarked that a certain feeling of pleasure accompanied those that were
beneficial, and pain those which were harmful. And in addition to this
pleasure and pain, I also experienced hunger, thirst, and other similar
appetites, as also certain corporeal inclinations towards joy, sadness,
anger, and other similar passions. And outside myself, in addition to extension,
figure, and motions of bodies, I remarked in them hardness, heat, and all
other tactice qualities, and, further, light and colour, and scents and
sounds, the variety of which gave me the means of distinguishing the sky,
the earth, the sea, and generally all the other bodies, one from the other.
And certainly, considering the ideas of all these qualities which presented
themselves to my mind, and which alone I perceived properly or immediately,
it was not without reason that I believed myself to perceive objects quite
different from my thought, to wit, bodies from which those ideas proceeded;
for I found by experience that these ideas presented themselves to me without
my consent being requisite, so that I could not perceive any object, however
desirous I might be, unless it were present to the organs of sense; and
it was not in my power not to perceive it, when it was present. And because
the ideas which I received through the senses were much more lively, more
clear, and even, in their own way, more distinct than any of those which
I could of myself frame in meditation, or than those I found impressed
on my memory, it appeared as though they could not have proceeded from
my mind, so that they must necessarily have been produced in me by some
other things. And having no knowledge of those objects excepting the knowledge
which the ideas themselves gave me, nothing was more likely to occur to
my mind than that the objects were similar to the ideas which were caused.
And because I likewise remembered that I had formerly made use of my senses
rather than my reason, and recognised that the ideas which I formed of
myself were not so distinct as those which I perceived through the senses,
and that they were most frequently even composed of portions of these last,
I persuaded myself easily that I had no idea in my mind which had not formerly
come to me through the senses. Nor was it without some reason that I believed
that this body (which be a certain special right I call my own) belonged
to me more properly and more strictly than any other; for in fact I could
never be separated from it as from other bodies; I experienced in it and
on account of it all my appetites and affections, and finally I was touched
by the feeling of pain and the titillation of pleasure in its parts, and
not in the parts of other bodies which were separated from it. But when
I inquired, why, from some, I know not what, painful sensation, there follows
sadness of mind, and from the pleasurable sensation there arises joy, or
why this mysterious pinching of the stomach which I call hunger causes
me to desire to eat, and dryness of throat causes a desire to drink, and
so on, I could give no reason excepting that nature taught me so; for there
is certainly no affinity (that I at least can understand) between the craving
of the stomach and the desire to eat, any more than between the perception
of whatever causes pain and the thought of sadness which arises from this
perception. And in the same way it appeared to me that I had learned from
nature all the other judgments which I formed regarding the objects of
my senses, since I remarked that these judgments were formed in me before
I had the leisure to weigh and consider any reasons which might oblige
me to make them.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But afterwards many experiences little by little destroyed all the faith
which I had rested in my senses; for I from time to time observed that
those towers which from afar appeared to me to be round, more closely observed
seemed square, and that colossal statues raised on the summit of these
towers, appeared as quite tiny statues when viewed from the bottom; and
so in an infinitude of other cases I found error in judgments founded on
the external senses. And not only in those founded on the external senses,
but even in those founded on the internal as well; for is there anything
more intimate or more internal than pain? And yet I have learned from some
persons whose arms or legs have been cut off, that they sometimes seemed
to feel pain in the part which had been amputated, which made me think
that I could not be quite certain that it was a certain member which pained
me, even although I felt pain in it. And to those grounds of doubt I have
lately added two others, which are very general; the first is that I never
have believed myself to feel anything in waking moments which I cannot
also sometimes believe myself to feel when I sleep, and as I do not think
that these things which I seem to feel in sleep, proceed from objects outside
of me, I do not see any reason why I should have this belief regarding
objects which I seem to perceive while awake. The other was that being
still ignorant, or rather supposing myself to be ignorant, of the author
of my being, I saw nothing to prevent me from having been so constituted
by nature that I might be deceived even in matters which seemed to me to
be most certain. And as to the grounds on which I was formerly persuaded
of the truth of sensible objects, I had not much trouble in replying to
them. For since nature seemed to cause me to lean towards many things from
which reason repelled me, I did not believe that I should trust much to
the teachings of nature. And although the ideas which I receive by the
senses do not depend on my will, I did not think that one should for that
reason conclude that they proceeded from things different from myself,
since possibly some faculty might be discovered in me -- though hitherto
unknown to me -- which produced them.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But now that I begin to know myself better, and to discover more clearly
the author of my being, I do not in truth think that I should rashly admit
all the matters which the senses seem to teach us, but, on the other hand,
I do not think that I should doubt them all universally.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And first of all, because I know that all things which I apprehend clearly
and distinctly can be created by God as I apprehend them, it suffices that
I am able to apprehend one thing apart from another clearly and distinctly
in order to be certain that the one is different from the other, since
they may be made to exist in separation at least by the omnipotence of
God; and it does not signify by what power this separation is made in order
to compel me to judge them to be different: and, therefore, just because
I know certainly that I exist, and that meanwhile I do not remark that
any other thing necessarily pertains to my nature or essence, excepting
that I am a thinking thing, I rightly conclude that my essence consists
solely in the fact that I am a thinking thin [or a substance whose whole
essence or nature is to think]. And although possibly (or rather certainly,
as I shall say in a moment) I possess a body with which I am very intimately
conjoined, yet because, on the one side, I have a clear and distinct idea
of myself inasmuch as I am only a thinking and unextended thing, and as,
on the other, I possess a distinct idea of body, inasmuch as it is only
an extended and unthinking thing, it is certain that this I [that is to
say, my soul by which I am what I am], is entirely and absolutely distinct
from my body, and can exist without it.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I further find in myself faculties imploying modes of thinking peculiar
to themselves, to wit, the faculties of imagination and feeling, without
which I can easily conceive myself clearly and distinctly as a complete
being; while, on the other hand, they cannot be so conceived apart from
me, that is without an intelligent substance in which they reside, for
[in the notion we have of these faculties, or, to use the language of the
Schools] in their formal concept, some kind of intellection is comprised,
from which I infer that they are distinct from me as its modes are from
a thing. I observe also in me some other faculties such as that of change
of position, the assumption of different figures and such like, which cannot
be conceived, any more than can the preceding, apart from some substance
to which they are attached, and consequently cannot exist without it; but
it is very clear that these faculties, if it be true that they exist, must
be attached to some corporeal or extended substance, and not to an intelligent
substance, since in the clear and distinct conception of these there is
some sort of extension found to be present, but no intellection at all.
There is certainly further in me a certain passive faculty of perception,
that is, of receiving and recognising the ideas of sensible things, but
this would be useless to me [and I could in no way avail myself of it],
if there were not either in me or in some other thing another active faculty
capable of forming and producing these ideas. But this active faculty cannot
exist in me [inasmuch as I am a thing that thinks] seeing that it does
not presuppose thought, and also that those ideas are often produced in
me without my contributing in any way to the same, and often even against
my will; it is thus necessarily the case that the faculty resides in some
substance different from me in which all the reality which is objectively
in the ideas that are produced by this faculty is formally or eminently
contained, as I remarked before. And this substance is either a body, that
is, a corporeal nature in which there is contained formally [and really]
all that which is objectively [and by representation] in those ideas, or
it is God Himself, or some other creature more noble than body in which
that same is contained eminently. But, since God is no deceiver, it is
very manifest that He does not communicate to me these ideas immediately
and by Himself, nor yet by the intervention of some creature in which their
reality is not formally, but only eminently, contained. For since He has
given me no faculty to recognise that this is the case, but, on the other
hand, a very great inclination to believe [that they are sent to me or]
that they are conveyed to me by corporeal objects, I do not see how He
could be defended from the accusation of deceit if these ideas were produced
by causes other than corporeal objects. Hence we must allow that corporeal
things exist. However, they are perhaps not exactly what we perceive by
the senses, since this comprehension by the senses is in many instances
very obscure and confused; but we must at least admit that all things which
I conceive in them clearly and distinctly, that is to say, all things which,
speaking generally, are comprehended in the object of pure mathematics,
are truly to be recognised as external objects.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>As to other things, however, which are either particular only, as, for
example, that the sun is of such and such a figure, etc., or which are
less clearly and distinctly conceived, such as light, sound, pain and the
like, it is certain that although they are very dubious and uncertain,
yet on the sole ground that God is not a deceiver, and that consequently
He has not permitted any falsity to exist in my opinion which He has not
likewise given me the faculty of correcting, I may assuredly hope to conclude
that I have within me the means of arriving at the truth even here. And
first of all there is no doubt that in all things which nature teaches
me there is some truth contained; for by nature, considered in general,
I now understand no other thing than either God Himself or else the order
and disposition which God has established in created things; and by my
nature in particular I understand no other thing than the complexus of
all the things which God has given me.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But there is nothing which this nature teaches me more expressly [nor
more sensibly] than that I have a body which is adversely affected when
I feel pain, which has need of food or drink when I experience the feelings
of hunger and thirst, and so on; nor can I doubt there being some truth
in all this.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Nature also teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger, thirst,
etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but
that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but that I
am very closely united to it, and so to speak so intermingled with it that
I seem to compose with it one whole. For if that were not the case, when
my body is hurt, I, who am merely a thinking thing, should not feel pain,
for I should perceive this wound by the understanding only, just as the
sailor perceives by sight when something is damaged in his vessel; and
when my body has need of drink or food, I should clearly understand the
fact without being warned of it by confused feelings of hunger and thirst.
For all these sensations of hunger, thirst, pain, etc. are in truth none
other than certain confused modes of thought which are produced by the
union and apparent intermingling of mind and body.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>Moreover, nature teaches me that many other bodies exist around mine,
of which some are to be avoided, and others sought after. And certainly
from the fact that I am sensible of different sorts of colours, sounds,
scents, tastes, heat, hardness, etc., I very easily conclude that there
are in the bodies from which all these diverse sense-perceptions proceed
certain variations which answer to them, although possibly these are not
really at all similar to them. And also from the fact that amongst these
different sense-perceptions some are very agreeable to me and others disagreeable,
it is quite certain that my body (or rather myself in my entirety, inasmuch
as I am formed of body and soul) may receive different impressions agreeable
and disagreeable from the other bodies which surround it.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But there are many other things which nature seems to have taught me,
but which at the same time I have never really received from her, but which
have been brought about in my mind by a certain habit which I have of forming
inconsiderate judgments on things; and thus it may easily happen that these
judgments contain some error. Take, for example, the opinion which I hold
that all space in which there is nothing that affects [or makes an impression
on] my senses is void; that in a body which is warm there is something
entirely similar to the idea of heat which is in me; that in a white or
green body there is the same whiteness or greenness that I perceive; that
in a bitter or sweet body there is the same taste, and so on in other instances;
that the stars, the towers, and all other distant bodies are of the same
figure and size as they appear from far off to our eyes, etc. But in order
that in this there should be nothing which I do not conceive distinctly,
I should define exactly what I really understand when I say that I am taught
somewhat by nature. For here I take nature in a more limited signification
than when I term it the sum of all the things given me by God, since in
this sum many things are comprehended which only pertain to mind (and to
these I do not refer in speaking of nature) such as the notion which I
have of the fact that what has once been done cannot ever be undone and
an infinitude of such things which I know by the light of nature [without
the help of the body]; and seeing that it comprehends many other matters
besides which only pertain to body, and are no longer here contained under
the name of nature, such as the quality of weight which it possesses and
the like, with which I also do not deal; for in talking of nature I only
treat of those things given by God to me as a being composed of mind and
body. But the nature here described truly teaches me to flee from things
which cause the sensation of pain, and seek after the things which communicate
to me the sentiment of pleasure and so forth; but I do not see that beyond
this it teaches me that from those diverse sense-perceptions we should
ever form any conclusion regarding things outside of us, without having
[carefully and maturely] mentally examined them beforehand. For it seems
to me that it is mind alone, and not mind and body in conjunction, that
is requisite to a knowledge of the truth in regard to such things. Thus,
although a star makes no larger an impression on my eye than the flame
of a little candle there is yet in me no real or positive propensity impelling
me to believe that it is not greater than that flame; but I have judged
it to be so from my earliest years, without any rational foundation. And
although in approaching fire I feel heat, and in approaching it a little
too near I even feel pain, there is at the same time no reason in this
which could persuade me that there is in the fire something resembling
this heat any more than there is in it something resembling the pain; all
that I have any reason to believe from this is, that there is something
in it, whatever it may be, which excites in me these sensations of heat
or of pain. So also, although there are spaces in which I find nothing
which excites my senses, I must not from that conclude that these spaces
contain no body; for I see in this, as in other similar things, that I
have been in the habit of perverting the order of nature, because these
perceptions of sense having bee placed within me by nature merely for the
purpose of signifying to my mind what things are beneficial or hurtful
to the composite whole of which it forms a part, and being up to that point
sufficiently clear and distinct, I yet avail myself of them as though they
were absolute rules by which I might immediately determine the essence
of the bodies which are outside me, as to which, in fact, they can teach
me nothing but what is most obscure and confused.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But I have already sufficiently considered how, notwithstanding the
supreme goodness of God, falsity enters into the judgments I make. Only
here a new difficulty is presented -- one respecting those things the pursuit
or avoidance of which is taught me by nature, and also respecting the internal
sensations which I possess, and in which I seem to have sometimes detected
error [and thus to be directly deceived by my own nature]. To take an example,
the agreeable taste of some food in which poison has been intermingled
may induce me to partake of the poison, and thus deceive me. It is true,
at the same time, that in this case nature may be excused, for it only
induces me to desire food in which I find a pleasant taste, and not to
desire the poison which is unknown to it; and thus I can infer nothing
from this fact, except that my nature is not omniscient, at which there
is certainly no reason to be astonished, since man, being finite in nature,
can only have knowledge the perfectness of which is limited.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But we not unfrequently deceive ourselves even in those things to which
we are directly impelled by nature, as happens with those who when they
are sick desire to drink or eat things hurtful to them. It will perhaps
be said here that the cause of their deceptiveness is that their nature
is corrupt, but that does not remove the difficulty, because a sick man
is none the less truly God's creature than he who is in health; and it
is therefore as repugnant to God's goodness for the one to have a deceitful
nature as it is for the other. And as a clock composed of wheels and counter-weights
no less exactly observes the laws of nature when it is badly made, and
does not show the time properly, than when it entirely satisfies the wishes
of its maker, and as, if I consider the body of a man as being a sort of
machine so built up and composed of nerves, muscles, veins, blood and skin,
that though there were no mind in it at all, it would not cease to have
the same motions as at present, exception being made of those movements
which are due to the direction of the will, and in consequence depend upon
the mind [as apposed to those which operate by the disposition of its organs],
I easily recognise that it would be as natural to this body, supposing
it to be, for example, dropsical, to suffer the parchedness of the throat
which usually signifies to the mind the feeling of thirst, and to be disposed
by this parched feeling to move the nerves and other parts in the way requisite
for drinking, and thus to augment its malady and do harm to itself, as
it is natural to it, when it has no indisposition, to be impelled to drink
for its good by a similar cause. And although, considering the use to which
the clock has been destined by its maker, I may say that it deflects from
the order of its nature when it does not indicate the hours correctly;
and as, in the same way, considering the machine of the human body as having
been formed by God in order to have in itself all the movements usually
manifested there, I have reason for thinking that it does not follow the
order of nature when, if the throat is dry, drinking does harm to the conservation
of health, nevertheless I recognise at the same time that this last mode
of explaining nature is very different from the other. For this is but
a purely verbal characterisation depending entirely on my thought, which
compares a sick man and a badly constructed clock with the idea which I
have of a healthy man and a well made clock, and it is hence extrinsic
to the things to which it is applied; but according to the other interpretation
of the term nature I understand something which is truly found in things
and which is therefore not without some truth.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>But certainly although in regard to the dropsical body it is only so
to speak to apply an extrinsic term when we say that its nature is corrupted,
inasmuch as apart from the need to drink, the throat is parched; yet in
regard to the composite whole, that is to say, to the mind or soul united
to this body, it is not a purely verbal predicate, but a real error of
nature, for it to have thirst when drinking would be hurtful to it. And
thus it still remains to inquire how the goodness of God does not prevent
the nature of man so regarded from being fallacious.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>In order to begin this examination, then, I here say, in the first place,
that there is a great difference between mind and body, inasmuch as body
is by nature always divisible, and the mind is entirely indivisible. For,
as a matter of fact, when I consider the mind, that is to say, myself inasmuch
as I am only a thinking thing, I cannot distinguish in myself any parts,
but apprehend myself to be clearly one and entire; and although the whole
mind seems to be united to the whole body, yet if a foot, or an arm, or
some other part, is separated from my body, I am aware that nothing has
been taken away from my mind. And the faculties of willing, feeling, conceiving,
etc. cannot be properly speaking said to be its parts, for it is one and
the same mind which employs itself in willing and in feeling and understanding.
But it is quite otherwise with corporeal or extended objects, for there
is not one of these imaginable by me which my mind cannot easily divide
into parts, and which consequently I do not recognise as being divisible;
this would be sufficient to teach me that the mind or soul of man is entirely
different from the body, if I had not already learned it from other sources.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I further notice that the mind does not receive the impressions from
all parts of the body immediately, but only from the brain, or perhaps
even from one of its smallest parts, to wit, from that in which the common
sense<sup>27</sup> is said to reside, which, whenever it is disposed in
the same particular way, conveys the same thing to the mind, although meanwhile
the other portions of the body may be differently disposed, as is testified
by innumerable experiments which it is unnecessary here to recount.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I notice, also, that the nature of body is such that none of its parts
can be moved by another part a little way off which cannot also be moved
in the same way by each one of the parts which are between the two, although
this more remote part does not act at all. As, for example, in the cord
ABCD [which is in tension] if we pull the last part D, the first part A
will not be moved in any way differently from what would be the case if
one of the intervening parts B or C were pulled, and the last part D were
to remain unmoved. And in the same way, when I feel pain in my foot, my
knowledge of physics teaches me that this sensation is communicated by
means of nerves dispersed through the foot, which, being extended like
cords from there to the brain, when they are contracted in the foot, at
the same time contract the inmost portions of the brain which is their
extremity and place of origin, and then excite a certain movement which
nature has established in order to cause the mind to be affected by a sensation
of pain represented as existing in the foot. But because these nerves must
pass through the tibia, the thigh, the loins, the back and the neck, in
order to reach from the leg to the brain, it may happen that although their
extremities which are in the foot are not affected, but only certain ones
of their intervening parts [which pass by the loins or the neck], this
action will excite the same movement in the brain that might have been
excited there by a hurt received in the foot, in consequence of which the
mind will necessarily feel in the foot the same pain as if it had received
a hurt. And the same holds good of all the other perceptions of our senses.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>I notice finally that since each of the movements which are in the portion
of the brain by which the mind is immediately affected brings about one
particular sensation only, we cannot under the circumstances imagine anything
more likely than that this movement, amongst all the sensations which it
is capable of impressing on it, causes mind to be affected by that one
which is best fitted and most generally useful for the conservation of
the human body when it is in health. But experience makes us aware that
all the feelings with which nature inspires us are such as I have just
spoken of; and there is therefore nothing in them which does not give testimony
to the power and goodness of the God [who has produced them<sup>28</sup>
]. Thus, for example, when the nerves which are in the feet are violently
or more than usually moved, their movement, passing through the medulla
of the spine<sup>29</sup> to the inmost parts of the brain, gives a sign
to the mind which makes it feel somewhat, to wit, pain, as though in the
foot, by which the mind is excited to do its utmost to remove the cause
of the evil as dangerous and hurtful to the foot. It is true that God could
have constituted the nature of man in such a way that this same movement
in the brain would have conveyed something quite different to the mind;
for example, it might have produced consciousness of itself either in so
far as it is in the brain, or as it is in the foot, or as it is in some
other place between the foot and the brain, or it might finally have produced
consciousness of anything else whatsoever; but none of all this would have
contributed so well to the conservation of the body. Similarly, when we
desire to drink, a certain dryness of the throat is produced which moves
its nerves, and by their means the internal portions of the brain; and
this movement causes in the mind the sensation of thirst, because in this
case there is nothing more useful to us than to become aware that we have
need to drink for the conservation o our health; and the same holds good
in other instances.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>From this it is quite clear that, notwithstanding the supreme goodness
of God, the nature of man, inasmuch as it is composed of mind and body,
cannot be otherwise than sometimes a source of deception. For if there
is any cause which excites, not in the foot but in some part of the nerves
which are extended between the foot and the brain, or even in the brain
itself, the same movement which usually is produced when the foot is detrimentally
affected, pain will be experienced as though it were in the foot, and the
sense will thus naturally be deceived; for since the same movement in the
brain is capable of causing but one sensation in the mind, and this sensation
is much more frequently excited by a cause which hurts the foot than by
another existing in some other quarter, it is reasonable that it should
convey to the mind pain in the foot rather than in any other part of the
body. And although the parchedness of the throat does not always proceed,
as it usually does, from the fact that drinking is necessary for the health
of the body, but sometimes comes from quite a different cause, as is the
case with dropsical patients, it is yet much better that it should mislead
on this occasion than if, on the other hand, it were always to deceive
us when the body is in good health; and so on in similar cases.</b></dd>

<dd>
<b>And certainly this consideration is of great service to me, not only
in enabling me to recognise all the errors to which my nature is subject,
but also in enabling me to avoid them or to correct them more easily. for
knowing that all my senses more frequently indicate to me truth than falsehood
respecting the things which concern that which is beneficial to the body,
and being able almost always to avail myself of many of them in order to
examine one particular thing, and, besides that, being able to make use
of my memory in order to connect the present with the past, and of my understanding
which already has discovered all the causes of my errors, I ought no longer
to fear that falsity may be found in matters every day presented to me
by my senses. And I ought to set aside all the doubts of these past days
as hyperbolical and ridiculous, particularly that very common uncertainty
respecting sleep, which I could not distinguish from the waking state;
for at present I find a very notable difference between the two, inasmuch
as our memory can never connect our dreams one with the other, or with
the whole course of our lives, as it unites events which happen to us while
we are awake. And, as a matter of fact, if someone, while I was awake,
quite suddenly appeared to me and disappeared as fast as do the images
which I see in sleep, so that I could not know from whence the form came
nor whither it went, it would not be without reason that I should deem
it a spectre or a phantom formed by my brain [and similar to those which
I form in sleep], rather than a real man. But when I perceive things as
to which I know distinctly both the place from which they proceed, and
that in which they are, and the time at which they appeared to me; and
when, without any interruption, I can connect the perceptions which I have
of them with the whole course of my life, I am perfectly assured that these
perceptions occur while I am waking and not during sleep. And I ought in
no wise to doubt the truth of such matters, if, after having called up
all my senses, my memory, and my understanding, to examine them, nothing
is brought to evidence by any one of them which is repugnant to what is
set forth by the others. For because God is in no wise a deceiver, it follows
that I am not deceived in this. But because the exigencies of action often
oblige us to make up our minds before having leisure to examine matters
carefully, we must confess that the life of man is very frequently subject
to error in respect to individual objects, and we must in the end acknowledge
the infirmity of our nature.</b></dd>
