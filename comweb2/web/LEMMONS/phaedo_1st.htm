Written by Plato in 360 B.C. Translated by Benjamin Jowett
<p><b>Persons of the Dialogue:</b> PHAEDO, who is the narrator of the dialogue
to ECHECRATES of Phlius
<br>SOCRATES, APOLLODORUS, SIMMIAS, CEBES, CRITO, and the ATTENDANT OF
THE PRISON
<p><b>PLACE OF THE NARRATION</b>: Phlius.
<p><b>Scene: </b>The Prison of Socrates.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Echecrates. Were you yourself, Phaedo, in the prison with Socrates on
the day when he drank the poison?
<p>Phaedo. Yes, Echecrates, I was.
<p>Ech. I wish that you would tell me about his death. What did he say
in his last hours? We were informed that he died by taking poison, but
no one knew anything more; for no Phliasian ever goes to Athens now, and
a long time has elapsed since any Athenian found his way to Phlius, and
therefore we had no clear account.
<p>Phaed. Did you not hear of the proceedings at the trial?
<p>Ech. Yes; someone told us about the trial, and we could not understand
why, having been condemned, he was put to death, as appeared, not at the
time, but long afterwards. What was the reason of this?
<p>Phaed. An accident, Echecrates. The reason was that the stern of the
ship which the Athenians send to Delos happened to have been crowned on
the day before he was tried.
<p>Ech. What is this ship?
<p>[1] Phaed. This is the ship in which, as the Athenians say, Theseus
went to Crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was the saviour
of them and of himself. And they were said to have vowed to Apollo at the
time, that if they were saved they would make an annual pilgrimage to Delos.
Now this custom still continues, and the whole period of the voyage to
and from Delos, beginning when the priest of Apollo crowns the stern of
the ship, is a holy season, during which the city is not allowed to be
polluted by public executions; and often, when the vessel is detained by
adverse winds, there may be a very considerable delay. As I was saying,
the ship was crowned on the day before the trial, and this was the reason
why Socrates lay in prison and was not put to death until long after he
was condemned.
<p>Ech. What was the manner of his death, Phaedo? What was said or done?
And which of his friends had he with him? Or were they not allowed by the
authorities to be present? And did he die alone?
<p>Phaed. No; there were several of his friends with him.
<p>Ech. If you have nothing to do, I wish that you would tell me what passed,
as exactly as you can.
<p>Phaed. I have nothing to do, and will try to gratify your wish. For
to me, too, there is no greater pleasure than to have Socrates brought
to my recollection, whether I speak myself or hear another speak of him.
<p>Ech. You will have listeners who are of the same mind with you, and
I hope that you will be as exact as you can.
<p>Phaed. I remember the strange feeling which came over me at being with
him. For I could hardly believe that I was present at the death of a friend,
and therefore I did not pity him, Echecrates; his mien and his language
were so noble and fearless in the hour of death that to me he appeared
blessed. I thought that in going to the other world he could not be without
a divine call, and that he would be happy, if any man ever was, when he
arrived there, and therefore I did not pity him as might seem natural at
such a time. But neither could I feel the pleasure which I usually felt
in philosophical discourse (for philosophy was the theme of which we spoke).
I was pleased, and I was also pained, because I knew that he was soon to
die, and this strange mixture of feeling was shared by us all; we were
laughing
and weeping by turns, especially the excitable Apollodorus-you know the
sort of man?
<p>Ech. Yes.
<p>Phaed. He was quite overcome; and I myself and all of us were greatly
moved.
<p>Ech. Who were present?
<p>Phaed. Of native Athenians there were, besides Apollodorus, Critobulus
and his father Crito, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines, and Antisthenes;
likewise Ctesippus of the deme of Paeania, Menexenus, and some others;
but Plato, if I am not mistaken, was ill.
<p>Ech. Were there any strangers?
<p>Phaed. Yes, there were; Simmias the Theban, and Cebes, and Phaedondes;
Euclid and Terpison, who came from Megara.
<p>Ech. And was Aristippus there, and Cleombrotus?
<p>Phaed. No, they were said to be in Aegina.
<p>Ech. Anyone else?
<p>Phaed. I think that these were about all.
<p>Ech. And what was the discourse of which you spoke?
<p>Phaed. I will begin at the beginning, and endeavor to repeat the entire
conversation. You must understand that we had been previously in the habit
of assembling early in the morning at the court in which the trial was
held, and which is not far from the prison. There we remained talking with
one another until the opening of the prison doors (for they were not opened
very early), and then went in and generally passed the day with Socrates.
On the last morning the meeting was earlier than usual; this was owing
to our having heard on the previous evening that the sacred ship had arrived
from Delos, and therefore we agreed to meet very early at the accustomed
place. On our going to the prison, the jailer who answered the door, instead
of admitting us, came out and bade us wait and he would call us. "For the
Eleven," he said, "are now with Socrates; they are taking off his chains,
and giving orders that he is to die to-day." He soon returned and said
that we might come in. On entering we found Socrates just released from
chains, and Xanthippe, whom you know, sitting by him, and holding his child
in her arms. When she saw us she uttered a cry and said, as women will:
"O Socrates, this is the last time that either you will converse with your
friends, or they with you." Socrates turned to Crito and said: "Crito,
let someone take her home." Some of Crito's people accordingly led her
away, crying out and beating herself. And when she was gone, Socrates,
sitting up on the couch, began to bend and rub his leg, saying, as he rubbed:
"How singular is the thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to
pain, which might be thought to be the opposite of it; for they never come
to a man together, and yet he who pursues either of them is generally compelled
to take the other. They are two, and yet they grow together out of one
head or stem; and I cannot help thinking that if Aesop had noticed them,
he would have made a fable about God trying to reconcile their strife,
and when he could not, he fastened their heads together; and this is the
reason why when one comes the other follows, as I find in my own case pleasure
comes following after the pain in my leg, which was caused by the chain."
<p>[2]
<p>Upon this Cebes said: I am very glad indeed, Socrates, that you mentioned
the name of Aesop. For that reminds me of a question which has been asked
by others, and was asked of me only the day before yesterday by Evenus
the poet, and as he will be sure to ask again, you may as well tell me
what I should say to him, if you would like him to have an answer. He wanted
to know why you who never before wrote a line of poetry, now that you are
in prison are putting Aesop into verse, and also composing that hymn in
honor of Apollo.
<p>Tell him, Cebes, he replied, that I had no idea of rivalling him or
his poems; which is the truth, for I knew that I could not do that. But
I wanted to see whether I could purge away a scruple which I felt about
certain dreams. In the course of my life I have often had intimations in
dreams "that I should make music." The same dream came to me sometimes
in one form, and sometimes in another, but always saying the same or nearly
the
same words: Make and cultivate music, said the dream. And hitherto I had
imagined that this was only intended to exhort and encourage me in the
study of philosophy, which has always been the pursuit of my life, and
is the noblest and best of music. The dream was bidding me to do what I
was already doing, in the same way that the competitor in a race is bidden
by the spectators to run when he is already running. But I was not certain
of this, as the dream might have meant music in the popular sense of the
word, and being under sentence of death, and the festival giving me a respite,
I thought that I should be safer if I satisfied the scruple, and, in obedience
to the dream, composed a few verses before I departed. And first I made
a hymn in honor of the god of the festival, and then considering that a
poet, if he is really to be a poet or maker, should not only put words
together but make stories, and as I have no invention, I took some fables
of esop, which I had ready at hand and knew, and turned them into verse.
Tell Evenus this, and bid him be of good cheer; that I would have him come
after me if he be a wise man, and not tarry; and that to-day I am likely
to be going, for the Athenians say that I must.
<p>Simmias said: What a message for such a man! having been a frequent
companion of his, I should say that, as far as I know him, he will never
take your advice unless he is obliged.
<p><b>Why, said Socrates,-is not Evenus a philosopher? I think that he
is, said Simmias. Then he, or any man who has the spirit of philosophy,
will be willing to die, though he will not take his own life, for that
is held not to be right.</b>
<p>Here he changed his position, and put his legs off the couch on to the
ground, and during the rest of the conversation he remained sitting.
<p>Why do you say, inquired Cebes, that a man ought not to take his own
life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow the dying?
<p>Socrates replied: And have you, Cebes and Simmias, who are acquainted
with Philolaus, never heard him speak of this?
<p>I never understood him, Socrates. My words, too, are only an echo; but
I am very willing to say what I have heard: and indeed, as I am going to
another place, I ought to be thinking and talking of the nature of the
pilgrimage which I am about to make. What can I do better in the interval
between this and the setting of the sun?
<p>Then tell me, Socrates, <b>why is suicide held not to be right? </b>as
I have certainly heard Philolaus affirm when he was staying with us at
Thebes: and there are others who say the same, although none of them has
ever made me understand him.
<p>But do your best, replied Socrates, and the day may come when you will
understand. I suppose that you wonder why, as most things which are evil
may be accidentally good, this is to be the only exception (for may not
death, too, be better than life in some cases?), and why, when a man is
better dead, he is not permitted to be his own benefactor, but must wait
for the hand of another.
<p>By Jupiter! yes, indeed, said Cebes, laughing, and speaking in his native
Doric.
<p>[3]
<p>I admit the appearance of inconsistency, replied Socrates, but there
may not be any real inconsistency after all in this. There is a doctrine
uttered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door
of his prison and run away; this is a great mystery which I do not quite
understand. Yet I, too, believe that the gods are our guardians, and that
we are a possession of theirs. Do you not agree?
<p>Yes, I agree to that, said Cebes. And if one of your own possessions,
an ox or an ass, for example took the liberty of putting himself out of
the way when you had given no intimation of your wish that he should die,
would you not be angry with him, and would you not punish him if you could?
<p>Certainly, replied Cebes. Then there may be reason in saying that a
man should wait, and not take his own life until God summons him, as he
is now summoning me.
<p>Yes, Socrates, said Cebes, there is surely reason in that. And yet how
can you reconcile this seemingly true belief that God is our guardian and
we his possessions, with that willingness to die which we were attributing
to the philosopher? That the wisest of men should be willing to leave this
service in which they are ruled by the gods who are the best of rulers
is not reasonable, for surely no wise man thinks that when set at liberty
he can take better care of himself than the gods take of him. A fool may
perhaps think this-he may argue that he had better run away from his master,
not considering that his duty is to remain to the end, and not to run away
from the good, and that there is no sense in his running away. But the
wise man will want to be ever with him who is better than himself. Now
this, Socrates, is the reverse of what was just now said; for upon this
view the wise man should sorrow and the fool rejoice at passing out of
life.
<p>The earnestness of Cebes seemed to please Socrates. Here, said he, turning
to us, is a man who is always inquiring, and is not to be convinced all
in a moment, nor by every argument.
<p>And in this case, added Simmias, his objection does appear to me to
have some force. For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting
to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself? And
I rather imagine that Cebes is referring to you; he thinks that you are
too ready to leave us, and too ready to leave the gods who, as you acknowledge,
are our good rulers.
<p>Yes, replied Socrates; there is reason in that. And this indictment
you think that I ought to answer as if I were in court?
<p>That is what we should like, said Simmias. Then I must try to make a
better impression upon you than I did when defending myself before the
judges.<i> For I am quite ready to acknowledge, Simmias and Cebes, that
I ought to be grieved at death, if I were not persuaded that I am going
to other gods who are wise and good (of this I am as certain as I can be
of anything of the sort) and to men departed (though I am not so certain
of this), who are better than those whom I leave behind; and therefore
I do not grieve as I might have done, for I have good hope that there is
yet something remaining for the dead, and, as has been said of old, some
far better thing for the good than for the evil.</i>
<p>But do you mean to take away your thoughts with you, Socrates? said
Simmias. Will you not communicate them to us?-the benefit is one in which
we too may hope to share. Moreover, if you succeed in convincing us, that
will be an answer to the charge against yourself.
<p>I will do my best, replied Socrates. But you must first let me hear
what Crito wants; he was going to say something to me.
<p>Only this, Socrates, replied Crito: the attendant who is to give you
the poison has been telling me that you are not to talk much, and he wants
me to let you know this; for that by talking heat is increased, and this
interferes with the action of the poison; those who excite themselves are
sometimes obliged to drink the poison two or three times.
<p>Then, said Socrates, let him mind his business and be prepared to give
the poison two or three times, if necessary; that is all.
<p>I was almost certain that you would say that, replied Crito; but I was
obliged to satisfy him.
<p>Never mind him, he said. And now I will make answer to you, O my judges,
and show that he who has lived as a true philosopher has reason to be of
good cheer when he is about to die, and that after death he may hope to
receive the greatest good in the other world. And how this may be, Simmias
and Cebes, I will endeavor to explain. For I deem that the true disciple
of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood by other men; they do not perceive
that he is ever pursuing death and dying; and if this is true, why, having
had the desire of death all his life long, should he repine at the arrival
of that which he has been always pursuing and desiring?
<p>[4]
<p>Simmias laughed and said: Though not in a laughing humor, I swear that
I cannot help laughing when I think what the wicked world will say when
they hear this. They will say that this is very true, and our people at
home will agree with them in saying that the life which philosophers desire
is truly death, and that they have found them out to be deserving of the
death which they desire.
<p>And they are right, Simmias, in saying this, with the exception of the
words "They have found them out"; for they have not found out what is the
nature of this death which the true philosopher desires, or how he deserves
or desires death. But let us leave them and have a word with ourselves:
<b>Do
we believe that there is such a thing as death?</b>
<p>To be sure, replied Simmias. And is this anything but the separation
of soul and body? And being dead is the attainment of this separation;
when the soul exists in herself, and is parted from the body and the body
is parted from the soul-that is death?
<p>Exactly: that and nothing else, he replied. And what do you say of another
question, my friend, about which I should like to have your opinion, and
the answer to which will probably throw light on our present inquiry: Do
you think that the philosopher ought to care about the pleasures-if they
are to be called pleasures-of eating and drinking?
<p>Certainly not, answered Simmias. And what do you say of the pleasures
of love-should he care about them?
<p>By no means. And will he think much of the other ways of indulging the
body-for example, the acquisition of costly raiment, or sandals, or other
adornments of the body? Instead of caring about them, does he not rather
despise anything more than nature needs? What do you say?
<p><i>I should say the true philosopher would despise them. Would you not
say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?
He would like, as far as he can, to be quit of the body and turn to the
soul.</i>
<p>That is true. In matters of this sort philosophers, above all other
men, may be observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the
body.
<p>That is true. Whereas, Simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion
that a life which has no bodily pleasures and no part in them is not worth
having; but that he who thinks nothing of bodily pleasures is almost as
though he were dead.
<p>That is quite true. <b>What again shall we say of the actual acquirement
of knowledge?-is the body, if invited to share in the inquiry, a hinderer
or a helper?</b> I mean to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them?
Are they not, as the poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses?
and yet, if even they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be said
of the other senses?-for you will allow that they are the best of them?
<p>Certainly, he replied. Then when does the soul attain truth?-for in
attempting to consider anything in company with the body she is obviously
deceived.
<p>Yes, that is true. Then must not existence be revealed to her in thought,
if at all? Yes. And thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself
and none of these things trouble her-neither sounds nor sights nor pain
nor any pleasure-when she has as little as possible to do with the body,
and has no bodily sense or feeling, but is aspiring after being?
<p>That is true. And in this the philosopher dishonors the body; his soul
runs away from the body and desires to be alone and by herself?
<p>That is true.
<br><b><font size=+1>Well, but there is another thing, Simmias: Is there
or is there not an absolute justice?</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Assuredly there is. And an absolute beauty and absolute
good? Of course.</font></b> <b>But did you ever behold any of them with
your eyes? Certainly not. Or did you ever reach them with any other bodily
sense? (and I speak not of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and
health, and strength, and of the essence or true nature of everything).
Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?
or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several
natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the
most exact conception of the essence of that which he considers?</b>
<p>[5]
<p><b>Certainly. And he attains to the knowledge of them in their highest
purity who goes to each of them with the mind alone, not allowing when
in the act of thought the intrusion or introduction of sight or any other
sense in the company of reason, but with the very light of the mind in
her clearness penetrates into the very fight of truth in each; he has got
rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and of the whole body, which he
conceives of only as a disturbing element, hindering the soul from the
acquisition of knowledge when in company with her-is not this the sort
of man who, if ever man did, is likely to attain the knowledge of existence?</b>
<p>There is admirable truth in that, Socrates, replied Simmias. And when
they consider all this, must not true philosophers make a reflection, of
which they will speak to one another in such words as these: We have found,
they will say, a path of speculation which seems to bring us and the argument
to the conclusion that while we are in the body, and while the soul is
mingled with this mass of evil, our desire will not be satisfied, and our
desire is of the truth.<i> For the body is a source of endless trouble
to us by reason of the mere requirement of food; and also is liable to
diseases which overtake and impede us in the search after truth: and by
filling us so full of loves, and lusts, and fears, and fancies, and idols,
and every sort of folly, prevents our ever having, as people say, so much
as a thought. For whence come wars, and fightings, and factions? whence
but from the body and the lusts of the body? For wars are occasioned by
the love of money, and money has to be acquired for the sake and in the
service of the body; and in consequence of all these things the time which
ought to be given to philosophy is lost. Moreover, if there is time and
an inclination toward philosophy, yet the body introduces a turmoil and
confusion and fear into the course of speculation, and hinders us from
seeing the truth: and all experience shows that if we would have pure knowledge
of anything we must be quit of the body, and the soul in herself must behold
all things in themselves: </i>then I suppose that we shall attain that
which we desire, and of which we say that we are lovers, and that is wisdom,
not while we live, but after death, as the argument shows; for if while
in company with the body the soul cannot have pure knowledge, one of two
things seems to follow-either knowledge is not to be attained at all, or,
if at all, after death. For then, and not till then, the soul will be in
herself alone and without the body. In this present life, I reckon that
we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible
concern or interest in the body, and are not saturated with the bodily
nature,<i> but remain pure until the hour when God himself is pleased to
release us</i>. And then the foolishness of the body will be cleared away
and we shall be pure and hold converse with other pure souls, and know
of ourselves the clear light everywhere; and this is surely the light of
truth. For no impure thing is allowed to approach the pure. These are the
sort of words, Simmias, which the true lovers of wisdom cannot help saying
to one another, and thinking. You will agree with me in that?
<p>Certainly, Socrates. But if this is true, O my friend, then there is
great hope that, going whither I go, I shall there be satisfied with that
which has been the chief concern of you and me in our past lives. And now
that the hour of departure is appointed to me, this is the hope with which
I depart, and not I only, but every man who believes that he has his mind
purified.
<p>Certainly, replied Simmias. And what is purification but the separation
of the soul from the body, as I was saying before; the habit of the soul
gathering and collecting herself into herself, out of all the courses of
the body; the dwelling in her own place alone, as in another life, so also
in this, as far as she can; <i>the release of the soul from the chains
of the bod</i>y?
<p>Very true, he said. And what is that which is termed death, but this
very separation and release of the soul from the body?
<p>To be sure, he said. And the true philosophers, and they only, study
and are eager to release the soul. Is not the separation and release of
the soul from the body their especial study?
<p>That is true. And as I was saying at first, there would be a ridiculous
contradiction in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state
of death, and yet repining when death comes.
<p>Certainly. Then, Simmias, as the true philosophers are ever studying
death, to them, of all men, death is the least terrible. Look at the matter
in this way: how inconsistent of them to have been always enemies of the
body, and wanting to have the soul alone, and when this is granted to them,
to be trembling and repining; instead of rejoicing at their departing to
that place where, when they arrive, they hope to gain that which in life
they loved (and this was wisdom), and at the same time to be rid of the
company of their enemy. Many a man has been willing to go to the world
below in the hope of seeing there an earthly love, or wife, or son, and
conversing with them. And will he who is a true lover of wisdom, and is
persuaded in like manner that only in the world below he can worthily enjoy
her, still repine at death?<i> Will he not depart with joy? Surely he will,
my friend, if he be a true philosopher. For he will have a firm conviction
that there only, and nowhere else, he can find wisdom in her purity. And
if this be true, he would be very absurd, as I was saying, if he were to
fear death.</i>
<p>[6]
<p>He would, indeed, replied Simmias. And when you see a man who is repining
at the approach of death, is not his reluctance a sufficient proof that
he is not a lover of wisdom, but a lover of the body, and probably at the
same time a lover of either money or power, or both?
<p>That is very true, he replied. There is a virtue, Simmias, which is
named <b>courage</b>. Is not that a special attribute of the philosopher?
<p>Certainly. Again, there is <b>temperance</b>. Is not the calm, and control,
and disdain of the passions which even the many call temperance, a quality
belonging only to those who despise the body and live in philosophy?
<p>That is not to be denied.
<p>. . . .
<p><b><font size=+1>Cebes answered: I agree, Socrates, in the greater part
of what you say. But in what relates to the soul, men are apt to be incredulous;
they fear that when she leaves the body her place may be nowhere, and that
on the very day of death she may be destroyed and perish-immediately on
her release from the body, issuing forth like smoke or air and vanishing
away into nothingness. For if she could only hold together and be herself
after she was released from the evils of the body, there would be good
reason to hope, Socrates, that what you say is true. But much persuasion
and many arguments are required in order to prove that when the man is
dead the soul yet exists, and has any force of intelligence.</font></b>
<p>. . .
<p>Cebes added: Your favorite doctrine, Socrates, that <b><font size=+1>knowledge
is simply recollection</font></b>, if true, also necessarily implies a
previous time in which we learned that which we now recollect. But this
would be impossible unless our soul was in some place before existing in
the human form; here, then, is another argument of the soul's immortality.
<p>But tell me, Cebes, said Simmias, interposing, what proofs are given
of this doctrine of recollection? I am not very sure at this moment that
I remember them.
<p>One excellent proof, said Cebes, is afforded by questions. If you put
a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true answer of himself;
but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right reason already
in him? And this is most clearly shown when he is taken to a diagram or
to anything of that sort.
<p>But if, said Socrates, you are still incredulous, Simmias, I would ask
you whether you may not agree with me when you look at the matter in another
way; I mean, if you are still incredulous as to whether knowledge is recollection.
<p>[9]
<p>Incredulous, I am not, said Simmias; but I want to have this doctrine
of recollection brought to my own recollection, and, from what Cebes has
said, I am beginning to recollect and be convinced; but I should still
like to hear what more you have to say.
<p>This is what I would say, he replied: We should agree, if I am not mistaken,
that what a man recollects he must have known at some previous time.
<p>Very true. And what is the nature of this recollection? And, in asking
this, I mean to ask whether, when a person has already seen or heard or
in any way perceived anything, and he knows not only that, but something
else of which he has not the same, but another knowledge, we may not fairly
say that he recollects that which comes into his mind. Are we agreed about
that?
<p>What do you mean? I mean what I may illustrate by the following instance:
The knowledge of a lyre is not the same as the knowledge of a man?
<p>True. And yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre,
or a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit
of using? Do not they, from knowing the lyre, form in the mind's eye an
image of the youth to whom the lyre belongs? And this is recollection:
and in the same way anyone who sees Simmias may remember Cebes; and there
are endless other things of the same nature.
<p>Yes, indeed, there are-endless, replied Simmias. And this sort of thing,
he said, is recollection, and is most commonly a process of recovering
that which has been forgotten through time and inattention.
<p>Very true, he said. Well; and may you not also from seeing the picture
of a horse or a lyre remember a man? and from the picture of Simmias, you
may be led to remember Cebes?
<p>True. Or you may also be led to the recollection of Simmias himself?
<p>True, he said. And in all these cases, the recollection may be derived
from things either like or unlike?
<p>That is true. And when the recollection is derived from like things,
then there is sure to be another question, which is, whether the likeness
of that which is recollected is in any way defective or not.
<p>Very true, he said. <i>And shall we proceed a step further, and affirm
that there is such a thing as equality, not of wood with wood, or of stone
with stone, but that, over and above this, there is equality in the abstract?</i>
Shall we affirm this?
<p>Affirm, yes, and swear to it, replied Simmias, with all the confidence
in life.
<p><b>And do we know the nature of this abstract essence? </b>To be sure,
he said. And whence did we obtain this knowledge? Did we not see equalities
of material things, such as pieces of wood and stones, and gather from
them the idea of an equality which is different from them?-you will admit
that? Or look at the matter again in this way: Do not the same pieces of
wood or stone appear at one time equal, and at another time unequal?
<p>That is certain. But are real equals ever unequal? or is the idea of
equality ever inequality?
<p>That surely was never yet known, Socrates. Then these (so-called) equals
are not the same with the idea of equality?
<p>I should say, clearly not, Socrates. And yet from these equals, although
differing from the idea of equality, you conceived and attained that idea?
<p>Very true, he said. Which might be like, or might be unlike them? Yes.
But that makes no difference; whenever from seeing one thing you conceived
another, whether like or unlike, there must surely have been an act of
recollection?
<p>[10]
<p>Very true. But what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone,
or other material equals? and what is the impression produced by them?
Are they equals in the same sense as absolute equality? or do they fall
short of this in a measure?
<p>Yes, he said, in a very great measure, too. And must we not allow that
when I or anyone look at any object, and perceive that the object aims
at being some other thing, but falls short of, and cannot attain to it-he
who makes this observation must have had previous knowledge of that to
which, as he says, the other, although similar, was inferior?
<p>Certainly. And has not this been our case in the matter of equals and
of absolute equality?
<p>Precisely. Then we must have known absolute equality previously to the
time when we first saw the material equals, and reflected that all these
apparent equals aim at this absolute equality, but fall short of it?
<p>That is true. And we recognize also that this absolute equality has
only been known, and can only be known, through the medium of sight or
touch, or of some other sense. And this I would affirm of all such conceptions.
<p>Yes, Socrates, as far as the argument is concerned, one of them is the
same as the other.
<p><b>And from the senses, then, is derived the knowledge that all sensible
things aim at an idea of equality of which they fall short-is not that
true?</b>
<p>Yes. Then before we began to see or hear or perceive in any way, we
must have had a knowledge of absolute equality, or we could not have referred
to that the equals which are derived from the senses-for to that they all
aspire, and of that they fall short?
<p>That, Socrates, is certainly to be inferred from the previous statements.
<p>And did we not see and hear and acquire our other senses as soon as
we were born?
<p>Certainly. Then we must have acquired the knowledge of the ideal equal
at some time previous to this?
<p>Yes. That is to say, before we were born, I suppose? True. And if we
acquired this knowledge before we were born, and were born having it, then
we also knew before we were born and at the instant of birth not only equal
or the greater or the less, but all other ideas; for we are not speaking
only of equality absolute, but of beauty, goodness, justice, holiness,
and all which we stamp with the name of essence in the dialectical process,
when we ask and answer questions. Of all this we may certainly affirm that
we acquired the knowledge before birth?
<p>That is true. But if, after having acquired, we have not forgotten that
which we acquired, then we must always have been born with knowledge, and
shall always continue to know as long as life lasts-for knowing is the
acquiring and retaining knowledge and not forgetting. Is not forgetting,
Simmias, just the losing of knowledge?
<p>[11]
<p>Quite true, Socrates. But if the knowledge which we acquired before
birth was lost by us at birth, and afterwards by the use of the senses
we recovered that which we previously knew, will not that which we call
learning be a process of recovering our knowledge, and may not this be
rightly termed recollection by us?
<p>Very true. For this is clear, that when we perceived something, either
by the help of sight or hearing, or some other sense, there was no difficulty
in receiving from this a conception of some other thing like or unlike
which had been forgotten and which was associated with this; and therefore,
as I was saying, one of two alternatives follows: either we had this knowledge
at birth, and continued to know through life; or, after birth, those who
are said to learn only remember, and learning is recollection only.
<p>Yes, that is quite true, Socrates. And which alternative, Simmias, do
you prefer? Had we the knowledge at our birth, or did we remember afterwards
the things which we knew previously to our birth?
<p>I cannot decide at the moment. At any rate you can decide whether he
who has knowledge ought or ought not to be able to give a reason for what
he knows.
<p>Certainly, he ought. But do you think that every man is able to give
a reason about these very matters of which we are speaking?
<p>I wish that they could, Socrates, but I greatly fear that to-morrow
at this time there will be no one able to give a reason worth having.
<p>Then you are not of opinion, Simmias, that all men know these things?
<p>Certainly not. Then they are in process of recollecting that which they
learned before.
<p>Certainly. But when did our souls acquire this knowledge?-not since
we were born as men?
<p>Certainly not. And therefore previously? Yes. <i>Then, Simmias, our
souls must have existed before they were in the form of man-without bodies,
and must have had intelligence.</i>
<p><i>Unless indeed you suppose, Socrates, that these notions were given
us at the moment of birth; for this is the only time that remains.</i>
<p><i>Yes, my friend, but when did we lose them? for they are not in us
when we are born-that is admitted. Did we lose them at the moment of receiving
them, or at some other time?</i>
<p><i>No, Socrates, I perceive that I was unconsciously talking nonsense.</i>
Then may we not say, Simmias, that if, as we are always repeating, there
is an absolute beauty, and goodness, and essence in general, and to this,
which is now discovered to be a previous condition of our being, we refer
all our sensations, and with this compare them-assuming this to have a
prior existence, then our souls must have had a prior existence, but if
not, there would be no force in the argument? There can be no doubt that
if these absolute ideas existed before we were born, then our souls must
have existed before we were born, and if not the ideas, then not the souls.
<p>Yes, Socrates; I am convinced that there is precisely the same necessity
for the existence of the soul before birth, and of the essence of which
you are speaking: and the argument arrives at a result which happily agrees
with my own notion. For there is nothing which to my mind is so evident
as that beauty, goodness, and other notions of which you were just now
speaking have a most real and absolute existence; and I am satisfied with
the proof.
<p>Well, but is Cebes equally satisfied? for I must convince him too. I
think, said Simmias, that Cebes is satisfied: although he is the most incredulous
of mortals, yet <b>I believe that he is convinced of the existence of the
soul before birth. But that after death the soul will continue to exist
is not yet proven even to my own satisfaction.</b> I cannot get rid of
the feeling of the many to which Cebes was referring-the feeling that when
the man dies the soul may be scattered, and that this may be the end of
her. For admitting that she may be generated and created in some other
place, and may have existed before entering the human body, why after having
entered in and gone out again may she not herself be destroyed and come
to an end?
<p>[12] . . . . Still I suspect that you and Simmias would be glad to probe
the argument further; like children, you are haunted with a fear that when
the soul leaves the body, the wind may really blow her away and scatter
her; especially if a man should happen to die in stormy weather and not
when the sky is calm.
<p>Cebes answered with a smile: Then, Socrates, you must argue us out of
our fears-and yet, strictly speaking, they are not our fears, but there
is a child within us to whom death is a sort of hobgoblin; him too we must
persuade not to be afraid when he is alone with him in the dark.
<p>Socrates said: Let the voice of the charmer be applied daily until you
have charmed him away.
<p>And where shall we find a good charmer of our fears, Socrates, when
you are gone?
<p>Hellas, he replied, is a large place, Cebes, and has many good men,
and there are barbarous races not a few: seek for him among them all, far
and wide, sparing neither pains nor money; for there is no better way of
using your money. And you must not forget to seek for him among yourselves
too; for he is nowhere more likely to be found.
<p>The search, replied Cebes, shall certainly be made. And now, if you
please, let us return to the point of the argument at which we digressed.
<p>By all means, replied Socrates; what else should I please? Very good,
he said. Must we not, said Socrates, ask ourselves some question of this
sort?-What is that which, as we imagine, is liable to be scattered away,
and about which we fear? and what again is that about which we have no
fear? And then we may proceed to inquire whether that which suffers dispersion
is or is not of the nature of soul-our hopes and fears as to our own souls
will turn upon that.
<p>That is true, he said. <i>Now the compound or composite may be supposed
to be naturally capable of being dissolved in like manner as of being compounded;
but that which is uncompounded, and that only, must be, if anything is,
indissoluble.</i>
<p>Yes; that is what I should imagine, said Cebes. And the uncompounded
may be assumed to be the same and unchanging, where the compound is always
changing and never the same?
<p>That I also think, he said. Then now let us return to the previous discussion.
Is that idea or essence, which in the dialectical process we define as
essence of true existence-whether essence of equality, beauty, or anything
else: are these essences, I say, liable at times to some degree of change?
or are they each of them always what they are, having the same simple,
self-existent and unchanging forms, and not admitting of variation at all,
or in any way, or at any time?
<p>They must be always the same, Socrates, replied Cebes. And what would
you say of the many beautiful-whether men or horses or garments or any
other things which may be called equal or beautiful-are they all unchanging
and the same always, or quite the reverse? May they not rather be described
as almost always changing and hardly ever the same either with themselves
or with one another?
<p>The latter, replied Cebes; they are always in a state of change.
<p>And these you can touch and see and perceive with the senses, but the
unchanging things you can only perceive with the mind-they are invisible
and are not seen?
<p>[13]
<p>That is very true, he said. Well, then, he added, let us suppose that
there are two sorts of existences, one seen, the other unseen.
<p>Let us suppose them. The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the
unchanging. That may be also supposed. And, further, is not one part of
us body, and the rest of us soul?
<p>To be sure. And to which class may we say that the body is<i> more alike
and akin</i>? Clearly to the seen: no one can doubt that. And is the soul
seen or not seen? Not by man, Socrates. And by "seen" and "not seen" is
meant by us that which is or is not visible to the eye of man?
<p>Yes, to the eye of man. And what do we say of the soul? is that seen
or not seen? Not seen. Unseen then? Yes. Then the soul is more like to
the unseen, and the body to the seen? That is most certain, Socrates. And
were we not saying long ago that the soul when using the body as an instrument
of perception, that is to say, when using the sense of sight or hearing
or some other sense (for the meaning of perceiving through the body is
perceiving through the senses)-were we not saying that the soul too is
then dragged by the body into the region of the changeable, and wanders
and is confused; the world spins round her, and she is like a drunkard
when under their influence?
<p><i>Very true. But when returning into herself she reflects; then she
passes into the realm of purity, and eternity, and immortality, and unchangeableness,
which are her kindred, and with them she ever lives, when she is by herself
and is not let or hindered; then she ceases from her erring ways, and being
in communion with the unchanging is unchanging. And this state of the soul
is called wisdom?</i>
<p>That is well and truly said, Socrates, he replied. And to which class
is the soul more nearly alike and akin, as far as may be inferred from
this argument, as well as from the preceding one?
<p>I think, Socrates, that, in the opinion of everyone who follows the
argument, the soul will be infinitely more like the unchangeable even the
most stupid person will not deny that.
<p>And the body is more like the changing? Yes. Yet once more consider
the matter in this light: When the soul and the body are united, then nature
orders the soul to rule and govern, and the body to obey and serve.
<p>Now which of these two functions is akin to the divine? and which to
the mortal? Does not the divine appear to you to be that which naturally
orders and rules, and the mortal that which is subject and servant?
<p>True. And which does the soul resemble? <i>The soul resembles the divine
and the body the mortal-</i>there can be no doubt of that, Socrates.
<p><i>Then reflect, Cebes: is not the conclusion of the whole matter this?-that
the soul is in the very likeness of the divine, and immortal, and intelligible,
and uniform, and indissoluble, and unchangeable; and the body is in the
very likeness of the human, and mortal, and unintelligible, and multiform,
and dissoluble, and changeable. </i>Can this, my dear Cebes, be denied?
<p>No, indeed. But if this is true, then is not the body liable to speedy
dissolution?
<p>and is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble? Certainly. And
do you further observe, that after a man is dead, the body, which is the
visible part of man, and has a visible framework, which is called a corpse,
and which would naturally be dissolved and decomposed and dissipated, is
not dissolved or decomposed at once, but may remain for a good while, if
the constitution be sound at the time of death, and the season of the year
favorable? For the body when shrunk and embalmed, as is the custom in Egypt,
may remain almost entire through infinite ages; and even in decay, still
there are some portions, such as the bones and ligaments, which are practically
indestructible. You allow that?
<p>Yes. And are we to suppose that the soul, which is invisible, in passing
to the true Hades, which like her is invisible, and pure, and noble, and
on her way to the good and wise God, whither, if God will, my soul is also
soon to go-that the soul, I repeat, if this be her nature and origin, is
blown away and perishes immediately on quitting the body as the many say?
That can never be, dear Simmias and Cebes. The truth rather is that the
soul which is pure at departing draws after her no bodily taint, having
never voluntarily had connection with the body, which she is ever avoiding,
herself gathered into herself (for such abstraction has been the study
of her life). And what does this mean but that she has been a true disciple
of philosophy and has practised how to die easily? And is not philosophy
the practice of death?
<p>[14]
<p>Certainly. That soul, I say, herself invisible, departs to the invisible
world to the divine and immortal and rational: thither arriving, she lives
in bliss and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and
wild passions and all other human ills, and forever dwells, as they say
of the initiated, in company with the gods. Is not this true, Cebes?
<p>Yes, said Cebes, beyond a doubt. <i>But the soul which has been polluted,
and is impure at the time of her departure, and is the companion and servant
of the body always, and is in love with and fascinated by the body and
by the desires and pleasures of the body, until she is led to believe that
the truth only exists in a bodily form, which a man may touch and see and
taste and use for the purposes of his lusts-the soul, I mean, accustomed
to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual principle, which to the bodily
eye is dark and invisible, and can be attained only by philosophy-do you
suppose that such a soul as this will depart pure and unalloyed?</i>
<p>That is impossible, he replied. She is engrossed by the corporeal, which
the continual association and constant care of the body have made natural
to her.
<p>Very true. And this, my friend, may be conceived to be that heavy, weighty,
earthy element of sight by which such a soul is depressed and dragged down
again into the visible world, because she is afraid of the invisible and
of the world below-prowling about tombs and sepulchres, in the neighborhood
of
which, as they tell us, <i>are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls
which have not departed pure, but are cloyed with sight and therefore visible.</i>
<p>That is very likely, Socrates. Yes, that is very likely, Cebes; and
<i>these
must be the souls, not of the good, but of the evil, who are compelled
to wander about such places in payment of the penalty of their former evil
way of life; and they continue to wander until the desire which haunts
them is satisfied and they are imprisoned in another body. And they may
be supposed to be fixed in the same natures which they had in their former
life.</i>
<p>What natures do you mean, Socrates? I mean to say that men who have
followed after gluttony, and wantonness, and drunkenness, and have had
no thought of avoiding them, would pass into asses and animals of that
sort. What do you think?
<p>I think that exceedingly probable. And those who have chosen the portion
of injustice, and tyranny, and violence, will pass into wolves, or into
hawks and kites; whither else can we suppose them to go?
<p>Yes, said Cebes; that is doubtless the place of natures such as theirs.
And there is no difficulty, he said, in assigning to all of them places
answering to their several natures and propensities?
<p>There is not, he said. Even among them some are happier than others;
and the happiest both in themselves and their place of abode are those
who have practised the civil and social virtues which are called temperance
and justice, and are acquired by habit and attention without philosophy
and mind.
<p>Why are they the happiest? Because they may be expected to pass into
some gentle, social nature which is like their own, such as that of bees
or ants, or even back again into the form of man, and just and moderate
men spring from them.
<p>That is not impossible. But he who is a philosopher or lover of learning,
and is entirely pure at departing, is alone permitted to reach the gods.
And this is the reason, Simmias and Cebes, why the true votaries of philosophy
abstain from all fleshly lusts, and endure and refuse to give themselves
up to them-not because they fear poverty or the ruin of their families,
like the lovers of money, and the world in general; nor like the lovers
of power and honor, because they dread the dishonor or disgrace of evil
deeds.
<p>[15]
<p>No, Socrates, that would not become them, said Cebes. No, indeed, he
replied; and therefore they who have a care of their souls, and do not
merely live in the fashions of the body, say farewell to all this; they
will not walk in the ways of the blind: and when philosophy offers them
purification and release from evil, they feel that they ought not to resist
her influence, and to her they incline, and whither she leads they follow
her.
<p>What do you mean, Socrates? I will tell you, he said. The lovers of
knowledge are conscious that their souls, when philosophy receives them,
are simply fastened and glued to their bodies: the soul is only able to
view existence through the bars of a prison, and not in her own nature;
she is wallowing in the mire of all ignorance; and philosophy, seeing the
terrible nature of her confinement, and that the captive through desire
is led to conspire in her own captivity (for the lovers of knowledge are
aware that this was the original state of the soul, and that when she was
in this state philosophy received and gently counseled her, and wanted
to release her, pointing out to her that the eye is full of deceit, and
also the ear and other senses, and persuading her to retire from them in
all but the necessary use of them and to be gathered up and collected into
herself, and to trust only to herself and her own intuitions of absolute
existence, and mistrust that which comes to her through others and is subject
to vicissitude)-philosophy shows her that this is visible and tangible,
but that what she sees in her own nature is intellectual and invisible.
And the soul of the true philosopher thinks that she ought not to resist
this deliverance, and therefore abstains from pleasures and desires and
pains and fears, as far as she is able; reflecting that when a man has
great joys or sorrows or fears or desires he suffers from them, not the
sort of evil which might be anticipated-as, for example, the loss of his
health or property, which he has sacrificed to his lusts-but he has suffered
an evil greater far, which is the greatest and worst of all evils, and
one of which he never thinks.
<p>And what is that, Socrates? said Cebes. Why, this:<b> When the feeling
of pleasure or pain in the soul is most intense, all of us naturally suppose
that the object of this intense feeling is then plainest and truest: but
this is not the case.</b>
<p>Very true. And this is the state in which the soul is most enthralled
by the body.
<p>How is that? <i>Why, because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail
which nails and rivets the soul to the body, and engrosses her and makes
her believe that to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from
agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is obliged to have
the same habits and ways, and is not likely ever to be pure at her departure
to the world below, but is always saturated with the body; so that she
soon sinks into another body and there germinates and grows, and has therefore
no part in the communion of the divine and pure and simple.</i>
<p>That is most true, Socrates, answered Cebes. And this, Cebes, is the
reason why the true lovers of knowledge are temperate and brave; and not
for the reason which the world gives.
<p>Certainly not. Certainly not! For not in that way does the soul of a
philosopher reason; she will not ask philosophy to release her in order
that when released she may deliver herself up again to the thraldom of
pleasures and pains, doing a work only to be undone again, weaving instead
of unweaving her Penelope's web. But she will make herself a calm of passion
and follow Reason, and dwell in her, beholding the true and divine (which
is not matter of opinion), and thence derive nourishment. Thus she seeks
to live while she lives, and after death she hopes to go to her own kindred
and to be freed from human ills. Never fear, Simmias and Cebes, that a
soul which has been thus nurtured and has had these pursuits, will at her
departure from the body be scattered and blown away by the winds and be
nowhere and nothing.
<p>When Socrates had done speaking, for a considerable time there was silence;
he himself and most of us appeared to be meditating on what had been said;
only Cebes and Simmias spoke a few words to one another. And Socrates observing
this asked them what they thought of the argument, and whether there was
anything wanting? For, said he, much is still open to suspicion and attack,
if anyone were disposed to sift the matter thoroughly. If you are talking
of something else I would rather not interrupt you, but if you are still
doubtful about the argument do not hesitate to say exactly what you think,
and let us have anything better which you can suggest; and if I am likely
to be of any use, allow me to help you.
<p>[16]
<p>Simmias said: I must confess, Socrates, that doubts did arise in our
minds, and each of us was urging and inciting the other to put the question
which he wanted to have answered and which neither of us liked to ask,
fearing that our importunity might be troublesome under present circumstances.
<p>Socrates smiled and said: O Simmias, how strange that is; I am not very
likely to persuade other men that I do not regard my present situation
as a misfortune, if I am unable to persuade you, and you will keep fancying
that I am at all more troubled now than at any other time. Will you not
allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?
For they, when they perceive that they must die, having sung all their
life long, do then sing more than ever, rejoicing in the thought that they
are about to go away to the god whose ministers they are. But men, because
they are themselves afraid of death, slanderously affirm of the swans that
they sing a lament at the last, not considering that no bird sings when
cold, or hungry, or in pain, not even the nightingale, nor the swallow,
nor yet the hoopoe; which are said indeed to tune a lay of sorrow, although
I do not believe this to be true of them any more than of the swans. But
because they are sacred to Apollo and have the gift of prophecy and anticipate
the good things of another world, therefore they sing and rejoice in that
day more than they ever did before. And I, too, believing myself to be
the consecrated servant of the same God, and the fellow servant of the
swans, and thinking that I have received from my master gifts of prophecy
which are not inferior to theirs, would not go out of life less merrily
than the swans. Cease to mind then about this, but speak and ask anything
which you like, while the eleven magistrates of Athens allow.
<p><b><font size=+1>Well, Socrates, said Simmias, then I will tell you
my difficulty,</font></b> and Cebes will tell you his. For I dare say that
you, Socrates, feel, as I do, how very hard or almost impossible is the
attainment of any certainty about questions such as these in the present
life. And yet I should deem him a coward who did not prove what is said
about them to the uttermost, or whose heart failed him before he had examined
them on every side. For he should persevere until he has attained one of
two things: either he should discover or learn the truth about them; or,
if this is impossible, I would have him take the best and most irrefragable
of human notions, and let this be the raft upon which he sails through
life-not without risk, as I admit, if he cannot find some word of God which
will more surely and safely carry him. And now, as you bid me, I will venture
to question you, as I should not like to reproach myself hereafter with
not having said at the time what I think. For when I consider the matter
either alone or with Cebes, the argument does certainly appear to me, Socrates,
to be not sufficient.
<p>Socrates answered: I dare say, my friend, that you may be right, but
I should like to know in what respect the argument is not sufficient.
<p>In this respect, replied Simmias: Might not a person use the same argument
about harmony and the lyre-might he not say that harmony is a thing invisible,
incorporeal, fair, divine, abiding in the lyre which is harmonized, but
that the lyre and the strings are matter and material, composite, earthy,
and akin to mortality? And when someone breaks the lyre, or cuts and rends
the strings, then he who takes this view would argue as you do, and on
the same analogy, that the harmony survives and has not perished; for you
cannot imagine, as we would say, that the lyre without the strings, and
the broken strings themselves, remain, and yet that the harmony, which
is of heavenly and immortal nature and kindred, has perished-and perished
too before the mortal. The harmony, he would say, certainly exists somewhere,
and the wood and strings will decay before that decays. For I suspect,
Socrates, that the notion of the soul which we are all of us inclined to
entertain, would also be yours, and that you too would conceive the body
to be strung up, and held together, by the elements of hot and cold, wet
and dry, and the like, and that the soul is the harmony or due proportionate
admixture of them. And, if this is true, the inference clearly is that
when the strings of the body are unduly loosened or overstrained through
disorder or other injury, then the soul, though most divine, like other
harmonies of music or of the works of art, of course perishes at once,
although the material remains of the body may last for a considerable time,
until they are either decayed or burnt. Now if anyone maintained that the
soul, being the harmony of the elements of the body, first perishes in
that which is called death, how shall we answer him?
<p>Socrates looked round at us as his manner was, and said, with a smile:
Simmias has reason on his side; and why does not some one of you who is
abler than myself answer him? for there is force in his attack upon me.
But perhaps, before we answer him, we had better also hear what Cebes has
to say against the argument-this will give us time for reflection, and
when both of them have spoken, we may either assent to them if their words
appear to be in consonance with the truth, or if not, we may take up the
other side, and argue with them. <b><font size=+1>Please to tell me then,
Cebes, he said, what was the difficulty which troubled you?</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Cebes said: I will tell you</font></b>. My feeling
is that the argument is still in the same position, and open to the same
objections which were urged before; for I am ready to admit that the existence
of the soul before entering into the bodily form has been very ingeniously,
and, as I may be allowed to say, quite sufficiently proven; but the existence
of the soul after death is still, in my judgment, unproven. Now my objection
is not the same as that of Simmias; for I am not disposed to deny that
the soul is stronger and more lasting than the body, being of opinion that
in all such respects the soul very far excels the body. Well, then, says
the argument to me, why do you remain unconvinced? When you see that the
weaker is still in existence after the man is dead, will you not admit
that the more lasting must also survive during the same period of time?
Now I, like Simmias, must employ a figure; and I shall ask you to consider
whether the figure is to the point. The parallel which I will suppose is
that of an old weaver, who dies, and after his death somebody says: He
is not dead, he must be alive; and he appeals to the coat which he himself
wove and wore, and which is still whole and undecayed. And then he proceeds
to ask of someone who is incredulous, whether a man lasts longer, or the
coat which is in use and wear; and when he is answered that a man lasts
far longer, thinks that he has thus certainly demonstrated the survival
of the man, who is the more lasting, because the less lasting remains.
But that, Simmias, as I would beg you to observe, is not the truth; everyone
sees that he who talks thus is talking nonsense. For the truth is that
this weaver, having worn and woven many such coats, though he outlived
several of them, was himself outlived by the last; but this is surely very
far from proving that a man is slighter and weaker than a coat. Now the
relation of the body to the soul may be expressed in a similar figure;
for you may say with reason that the soul is lasting, and the body weak
and short-lived in comparison. And every soul may be said to wear out many
bodies, especially in the course of a long life. For if while the man is
alive the body deliquesces and decays, and yet the soul always weaves her
garment anew and repairs the waste, then of course, when the soul perishes,
she must have on her last garment, and this only will survive her; but
then again when the soul is dead the body will at last show its native
weakness, and soon pass into decay. And therefore this is an argument on
which I would rather not rely as proving that the soul exists after death.
For suppose that we grant even more than you affirm as within the range
of possibility, and besides acknowledging that the soul existed before
birth admit also that after death the souls of some are existing still,
and will exist, and will be born and die again and again, and that there
is a natural strength in the soul which will hold out and be born many
times-for all this, we may be still inclined to think that she will weary
in the labors of successive births, and may at last succumb in one of her
deaths and utterly perish; and this death and dissolution of the body which
brings destruction to the soul may be unknown to any of us, for no one
of us can have had any experience of it: and if this be true, then I say
that he who is confident in death has but a foolish confidence, unless
he is able to prove that the soul is altogether immortal and imperishable.
But if he is not able to prove this, he who is about to die will always
have reason to fear that when the body is disunited, the soul also may
utterly perish.

<p>All of us, as we afterwards remarked to one another, had an unpleasant
feeling at hearing them say this. When we had been so firmly convinced
before, now to have our faith shaken seemed to introduce a confusion and
uncertainty, not only into the previous argument, but into any future one;
either we were not good judges, or there were no real grounds of belief.
<p>Ech. There I feel with you-indeed I do, Phaedo, and when you were speaking,
I was beginning to ask myself the same question: What argument can I ever
trust again? For what could be more convincing than the argument of Socrates,
which has now fallen into discredit? That the soul is a harmony is a doctrine
which has always had a wonderful attraction for me, and, when mentioned,
came back to me at once, as my own original conviction. And now I must
begin again and find another argument which will assure me that when the
man is dead the soul dies not with him. Tell me, I beg, how did Socrates
proceed? Did he appear to share the unpleasant feeling which you mention?
or did he receive the interruption calmly and give a sufficient answer?
Tell us, as exactly as you can, what passed.
<p>Phaed. Often, Echecrates, as I have admired Socrates, I never admired
him more than at that moment. That he should be able to answer was nothing,
but what astonished me was, first, the gentle and pleasant and approving
manner in which he regarded the words of the young men, and then his quick
sense of the wound which had been inflicted by the argument, and his ready
application of the healing art. He might be compared to a general rallying
his defeated and broken army, urging them to follow him and return to the
field of argument.
<p>Ech. How was that?
<p>Phaed. You shall hear, for I was close to him on his right hand, seated
on a sort of stool, and he on a couch which was a good deal higher. Now
he had a way of playing with my hair, and then he smoothed my head, and
pressed the hair upon my neck, and said: To-morrow, Phaedo, I suppose that
these fair locks of yours will be severed.
<p>Yes, Socrates, I suppose that they will, I replied. Not so if you will
take my advice. What shall I do with them? I said. To-day, he replied,
and not to-morrow, if this argument dies and cannot be brought to life
again by us, you and I will both shave our locks; and if I were you, and
could not maintain my ground against Simmias and Cebes, I would myself
take an oath, like the Argives, not to wear hair any more until I had renewed
the conflict and defeated them.
<p>Yes, I said, but Heracles himself is said not to be a match for two.
Summon me then, he said, and I will be your Iolaus until the sun goes down.
<p>I summon you rather, I said, not as Heracles summoning Iolaus, but as
Iolaus might summon Heracles.
<p>That will be all the same, he said. But first let us take care that
we avoid a danger.
<p>And what is that? I said. <b>The danger of becoming misologists</b>,
he replied, which is one of the very worst things that can happen to us.
<i>For
as there are misanthropists or haters of men, there are also misologists
or haters of ideas, and both spring from the same cause, which is ignorance
of the world.</i> Misanthropy arises from the too great confidence of inexperience;
you trust a man and think him altogether true and good and faithful, and
then in a little while he turns out to be false and knavish; and then another
and another, and when this has happened several times to a man, especially
within the circle of his most trusted friends, as he deems them, and he
has often quarreled with them, he at last hates all men, and believes that
no one has any good in him at all. I dare say that you must have observed
this.
<p>Yes, I said. And is not this discreditable? The reason is that a man,
having to deal with other men, has no knowledge of them; for if he had
knowledge he would have known the true state of the case, that few are
the good and few the evil, and that the great majority are in the interval
between them.
<p>How do you mean? I said. I mean, he replied, as you might say of the
very large and very small, that nothing is more uncommon than a very large
or a very small man; and this applies generally to all extremes, whether
of great and small, or swift and slow, or fair and foul, or black and white:
and whether the instances you select be men or dogs or anything else, few
are the extremes, but many are in the mean between them. Did you never
observe this?
<p>Yes, I said, I have. And do you not imagine, he said, that if there
were a competition of evil, the first in evil would be found to be very
few?
<p>[18]
<p>Yes, that is very likely, I said. Yes, that is very likely, he replied;
not that in this respect arguments are like men-there I was led on by you
to say more than I had intended; but the point of comparison was that when
a simple man who has no skill in dialectics believes an argument to be
true which he afterwards imagines to be false, whether really false or
not, and then another and another, he has no longer any faith left, and
great disputers, as you know, come to think, at last that they have grown
to be the wisest of mankind; for they alone perceive the utter unsoundness
and instability of all arguments, or, indeed, of all things, which, like
the currents in the Euripus, are going up and down in never-ceasing ebb
and flow.
<p>That is quite true, I said. Yes, Phaedo, he replied, and very melancholy
too, if there be such a thing as truth or certainty or power of knowing
at all, that a man should have lighted upon some argument or other which
at first seemed true and then turned out to be false, and instead of blaming
himself and his own want of wit, because he is annoyed, should at last
be too glad to transfer the blame from himself to arguments in general;
and forever afterwards should hate and revile them, and lose the truth
and knowledge of existence.
<p>Yes, indeed, I said; that is very melancholy.<i> Let us, then, in the
first place, he said, be careful of admitting into our souls the notion
that there is no truth or health or soundness in any arguments at all;
but let us rather say that there is as yet no health in us, and that we
must quit ourselves like men and do our best to gain health-you and all
other men with a view to the whole of your future life, and I myself with
a view to death. </i>For at this moment I am sensible that I have not the
temper of a philosopher; like the vulgar, I am only a partisan. For the
partisan, when he is engaged in a dispute, cares nothing about the rights
of the question, but is anxious only to convince his hearers of his own
assertions. And the difference between him and me at the present moment
is only this-that whereas he seeks to convince his hearers that what he
says is true, I am rather seeking to convince myself; to convince my hearers
is a secondary matter with me. And do but see how much I gain by this.
For if what I say is true, then I do well to be persuaded of the truth,
but if there be nothing after death, still, during the short time that
remains, I shall save my friends from lamentations, and my ignorance will
not last, and therefore no harm will be done. This is the state of mind,
Simmias and Cebes, in which I approach the argument. And I would ask you
to be thinking of the truth and not of Socrates: agree with me, if I seem
to you to be speaking the truth; or if not, withstand me might and main,
that I may not deceive you as well as myself in my enthusiasm, and, like
the bee, leave my sting in you before I die.
