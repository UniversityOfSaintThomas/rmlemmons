<P><B>I.75.1: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IMMATERIAL? </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, between the mover and the moved there must be contact.
But contact is only between bodies. <B>Since</B>, <B>therefore</B>, the
soul moves the body, it seems that the soul must be a material body. <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that,</B> To seek the nature of the soul, we must premise
that the soul is defined as the first principle of life of those things
which live: <B>for</B> we call living things &quot;animate,&quot; [*i.e.
having a soul], and those things which have no life, &quot;inanimate.&quot;
Now life is shown principally by two actions, knowledge and movement. </P>

<P><I>The philosophers of old</I>, not being able to rise above their imagination,
supposed that the principle of these actions was something corporeal: <B>for</B>
they asserted that only bodies were real things; and that what is not corporeal
is nothing: <B>hence</B> they maintained that the soul is something corporeal.
This opinion can be proved to be false in many ways; but we shall make
use of only one <B>proof</B>, based on universal and certain principles,
which shows clearly that the soul is not a body. </P>

<P>Now, though matter may be a principle of life as the heart is a principle
of life in an animal, nothing material can be the first principle of life.
<B>For</B> it is clear that to be a principle of life, or to be alive,
does not belong to matter as such; <B>since</B>, if that were the case,
all material things would be alive. <B>Therefore</B> matter---which is
able to be a living thing or even a principle of life---is as such only
<I>potentially</I> a living body. When it is <I>actually</I> a body, some
principle must be activating its potency for being a living body. [That
principle of activation is the soul.] Accordingly, the soul as the first
principle of life [does not consists of matter; it is rather immaterial
so that it can animate matter into a living body.] <BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 3: [Not all contact is between bodies.] There are two kinds
of contact; of &quot;quantity,&quot; and of &quot;power.&quot; By the former
a body can be touched only by a body; by the latter a body can be touched
by an incorporeal thing, which moves that body. <BR wp="br1">

<P><B>I.75.2: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS SOMETHING SUBSISTENT? </B></P>

<P><B>[Since subsistence means to exist on one's own, this article is asking
whether the human soul has the type of existence that enables it to exist
on its own, i.e. independently of matter. If the human soul does not subsist,
then it exists only when making a body be alive.] </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, if the soul were subsistent, it would have some operation
apart from the body. But it has no operation apart from the body, not even
that of understanding: for the act of understanding does not take place
without a <I>sense image</I>, which cannot exist apart from the body. Therefore
the human soul is not something subsistent. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, It must necessarily be allowed that the principle
of intellectual operation which we call the soul, is a principle both incorporeal
and subsistent. For it is clear that by means of the intellect man can
have knowledge of all corporeal things. Now whatever knows certain things
cannot have any of them in its own nature; because that which is in it
naturally would impede the knowledge of anything else. Thus we observe
that [none can sense the temperature of water when the hand is as warm
as the water]. Hence, if the intellectual principle contained the nature
of a body it would be unable to know all bodies. Therefore, since every
body has its own determinate nature, it is impossible for the intellectual
principle to be a body. It is likewise impossible for it to understand
by means of a bodily organ; since the determinate nature of that organ
would impede knowledge of all bodies; as when a certain determinate color
is not only in the pupil of the eye, but also in a glass vase, the liquid
in the vase seems to be of that same color. </B></P>

<P><B>Therefore the intellectual principle which we call the mind or the
intellect has an operation in and through itself apart from the body. Now
only that which subsists can have an operation in and through itself. For
nothing can operate but what is actual: for which reason we do not say
that heat imparts heat, but that what is hot gives heat. We must conclude,
therefore, that the human soul, which is called the intellect or the mind,
is something incorporeal and subsistent. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 3: The body is necessary for the action of the intellect,
not as its origin of action, but on the part of the object; for the sense
image is to the intellect what color is to the sight. Neither does such
a dependence on the body prove the intellect to be non-subsistent; otherwise
it would follow that an animal is non-subsistent, since it requires external
objects of the senses in order to perform its act of perception. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>ARTICLE COMMENTARY: </B></P>

<P><B>In this article Aquinas relies upon the principle that ACTION REVEALS
NATURE, i.e. a thing acts according to its nature. Thus, if the intellect
has an act that is independent of matter, then it must exist independently
of matter (it must be its own subsistence). The intellect has such an act
because its ability to know all material things presupposes that it does
not consists of matter; the intellect is not the brain. This article thus
presents a key argument against materialism. </B></P>

<P><B>Another argument based upon Thomistic principles is that since matter
is the principle of individuation, universals can neither exist in matter
nor be known by a material entity. Therefore, the intellectual soul which
knows universals cannot be material. See I.75.5 for Aquinas' more detailed
argument. </B><BR wp="br1">

<P><B>I.75.3: WHETHER THE SOULS OF BRUTE ANIMALS ARE SUBSISTENT? </B></P>

<P><B>[If animal souls are subsistent, then it would be possible for animals
to be immortal.] </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 1: It would seem that the souls of brute animals are subsistent.
For man is of the same 'genus' as other animals; and, as we have just shown
(A2), the soul of man is subsistent. Therefore the souls of other animals
are subsistent. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, the soul of brute animals moves the body. But the
body is not a mover, but is moved. Therefore the soul of brute animals
has an operation apart from the body. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, <I>The ancient philosophers</I> made no distinction
between sense and intellect, and referred both a corporeal principle, as
has been said (A1). <I>Plato</I>, however, drew a distinction between intellect
and sense; yet he referred both to an incorporeal principle, maintaining
that sensing, just as understanding, belongs to the soul as such. From
this it follows that even the souls of brute animals are subsistent. But
<I>Aristotle</I> held that of the operations of the soul, understanding
alone is performed without a corporeal organ. </B></P>

<P><B><I>On the other hand</I>, sensation and the consequent operations
of the sensitive soul are evidently accompanied with change in the body;
thus in the act of vision, the pupil of the eye is affected by a reflection
of color: and so with the other senses. Hence it is clear that the sensitive
soul has no act in and through itself, and that every operation of the
sensitive soul belongs to the composite. Therefore we conclude that since
the souls of brute animals have no acts in and through themselves, they
are not subsistent. For the operation of anything follows the mode of its
being. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 1: Although man is of the same &quot;genus&quot; as other
animals, he is of a different &quot;species.&quot; Specific difference
is derived from the difference of form; nor does every difference of form
necessarily imply a diversity of &quot;genus.&quot; </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 3: Motive power is of <I>two</I> kinds. <I>One</I>, the
appetitive power, commands motion. The operation of this power in the sensitive
soul is not apart from the body; for anger, joy, and passions of a like
nature are accompanied by a change in the body. The <I>other</I> motive
power is that which executes motion in adapting the members for obeying
the appetite; and the act of this power does not consist in moving, but
in being moved. Whence it is clear that to move is not an act of the sensitive
soul without the body. </B><BR wp="br1">

<P><B>I.75.4: WHETHER THE SOUL IS MAN? </B></P>

<P><B>[If Aquinas would argue that the soul is man, then Aquinas would
hold the same position as Plato.} </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 1: It would seem that the soul is man. For it is written (2 Cor.
4:16): &quot;Though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is
renewed day by day.&quot; But that which is within man is the soul. Therefore
the soul is the inward man. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B><I>ON THE CONTRARY</I>, Augustine (De Civ. Dei xix, 3) commends Varro
as holding &quot;that man is not a mere soul, nor a mere body; but both
soul and body.&quot; </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, The assertion &quot;the soul is man,&quot; can be
taken in <I>two</I> senses. <I>First</I>, that man is a soul; though this
particular man, Socrates, for instance, is not a soul, but composed of
soul and body. I say this, for as much as some held that the form alone
belongs to the species; while matter is part of the individual, and not
the species. This cannot be true; for to the nature of the species belongs
what the definition signifies; and in natural things the definition does
not signify the form only, but the form and the matter. Hence in natural
things the matter is part of the species; not, indeed, <I>signate matter</I>,
which is the principle of individuality; but the <I>common matter</I>.
For as it belongs to the notion of this particular man to be composed of
this soul, of this flesh, and of these bones; so it belongs to the notion
of man to be composed of soul, flesh, and bones; for whatever belongs in
common to the substance of all the individuals contained under a given
species, must belong to the substance of the species. </B></P>

<P><B>It may also be understood in this sense, that this soul is this man;
and this could be held if it were supposed that the operation of the sensitive
soul were proper to it, apart from the body; because in that case all the
operations which are attributed to man would belong to the soul only; and
whatever performs the operations proper to a thing, is that thing; therefore
that which performs the operations of a man is man. But it has been shown
above (A3) that sensation is not the operation of the soul only. Since,
then, sensation is an operation of man, but not proper to him, it is clear
that man is not a soul only, but something composed of soul and body. <I>Plato</I>,
through supposing that sensation was proper to the soul, could maintain
man to be a soul making use of the body. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 1: According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix, 8), a thing
seems to be chiefly what is principle in it; thus what the governor of
a state does, the state is said to do. In this way sometimes what is principle
in man is said to be man; sometimes, indeed, the intellectual part which,
in accordance with truth, is called the &quot;inward&quot; man; and sometimes
the sensitive part with the body is called man in the opinion of those
whose observation does not go beyond the senses. And this is called the
&quot;outward&quot; man. </B><BR wp="br1">

<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I.75.5: WHETHER THE SOUL IS COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM? </B></P>

<P><B>I answer that, The soul has no matter. We may consider this question
in two ways. <I>First,</I> from the notion of a soul in general; for it
belongs to the notion of a soul to be the form of a body. Now, <I>either</I>
it is a form by virtue of itself, in its entirety, <I>or</I> by virtue
of some part of itself. If by virtue of itself in its entirety, then it
is impossible that any part of it should be matter, if by matter we understand
something purely potential: for a form, as such, is an act; and that which
is purely potentiality cannot be part of an act, since potentiality is
repugnant to actuality as being opposite thereto. If, however, it be a
form by virtue of a part of itself, then we call that part the soul: and
that matter, which it actualizes first, we call &quot;[a living] body.&quot;
</B></P>

<P><B><I>Secondly</I>, we may proceed from the specific notion of the human
soul inasmuch as it is intellectual. For it is clear that whatever is received
into something is received according to the condition of the recipient.
Now a thing is known in as far as its form is in the knower. But the intellectual
soul [understands the universal natures of things]: for instance, it knows
a stone according to its nature as a stone [[as it knows wax according
to its nature as wax]]; and therefore the form of a stone universally considered
is in the intellectual soul. ...<I>But if the intellectual soul were composed
of matter and form, the forms of things would be received into it as individuals,
and so it would only know the individual</I>: just as it happens with the
sensitive powers which receive forms in a corporeal organ; since matter
is the principle by which forms are individualized. It follows, therefore,
that the intellectual soul, and every intellectual substance which has
knowledge of [universals] is exempt from composition of matter and form.

<P><B>I.75.6: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS INCORRUPTIBLE? </B></P>

<P><B>[If the soul is incorruptible, then it is immortal because what is
incorruptible cannot dissipate or be destroyed.] </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, nothing is without its own proper operation. But
the operation proper to the soul, which is to understand through a sense
image, cannot be without the body. For the soul understands nothing without
a sense image; and there is no sense image without the body as the Philosopher
says (De Anima i, 1). Therefore the soul cannot survive the dissolution
of the body. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, We must assert that the intellectual principle which
we call the human soul is incorruptible. For a thing may be corrupted in
two ways---through itself and through another. Now it is impossible for
any substance to be generated or corrupted through another. .... for generation
and corruption belong to a thing, just as existence belongs to it, which
is acquired by generation and lost by corruption. Therefore, whatever has
existence through itself cannot be generated or corrupted except through
itself; while things which do not subsist, such as properties and material
forms, acquire existence or lose it through the generation or corruption
of composite things. Now it was shown above (AA2,3) that the souls of brutes
are not self-subsistent, whereas the human soul is; so that the souls of
brutes are corrupted, when their bodies are corrupted; while the human
soul could not be corrupted unless it were corrupted &quot;per se.&quot;
This, indeed, is impossible, not only as regards the human soul, but also
as regards anything subsistent that is a form alone. <I>For</I> it is clear
that what belongs to a thing by virtue of itself is inseparable from it;
but subsistence belongs to those forms which have an act that is NOT in
and through matter by virtue of itself. Therefore matter acquires actual
existence as it acquires the form; while it is corrupted so far as the
form is separated from it. But it is impossible for a form to be separated
from itself; and therefore it is impossible for a subsistent form to cease
to exist. </B></P>

<P><B>... Moreover ...a sign [that this argument is right may be taken]
from the fact that everything naturally aspires to existence after its
own manner. Now, in things that have knowledge, desire ensues upon knowledge.
The senses indeed do not know existence, except under the conditions of
&quot;here&quot; and &quot;now,&quot; whereas the intellect apprehends
existence absolutely, and for all time; so that everything that has an
intellect naturally desires always to exist. <I>But a natural desire cannot
be in vain.</I> Therefore every intellectual substance is incorruptible.
</B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 3: To understand through a sense image is the proper operation
of the soul by virtue of its union with the body. After separation from
the body it will have another mode of understanding, similar to other substances
separated from bodies, as will appear later on (Q89, A1). </B><BR wp="br1">

<P><B>I.75.7: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS AN ANGEL?
</B></P>

<P><B>[If Aquinas were to answer &quot;yes,&quot; then human beings would
become angels after death.] </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, it seems that the soul does not differ from an angel
except in its union with the body. But as the body is outside the essence
of the soul, it seems that it does not belong to its species. Therefore
the soul and angel are of the same species. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B><I>ON THE CONTRARY</I>, Things which have different natural operations
are of different species. <I>[ACTIVITIES REVEAL NATURE</I>.] But the natural
operations of the soul and of an angel are different; since, as Dionysius
says (Div. Nom. vii), &quot;Angelic minds have simple and blessed intelligence,
not gathering their knowledge of Divine things from visible things.&quot;
Subsequently he says the contrary to this of the soul. Therefore the soul
and an angel are not of the same species. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, angels and human souls cannot belong to the same species;
for in incorporeal substances there cannot be diversity of number without
diversity of species and inequality of nature; because, as they are not
composed of matter and form, but are subsistent forms, it is clear that
there is necessarily among them a diversity of species. For a separate
form cannot be understood otherwise than as one of a single species; thus,
supposing a separate whiteness to exist, it could only be one; forasmuch
as one whiteness does not differ from another except as in this or that
subject. [In other words,<I> human beings differ in their bodies but not
in their species; while angels, since they are immaterial substances, cannot
differ except by being different species.] </I></B><BR wp="br1">

<P><B>Reply OBJ 3: The body is not of the essence of the soul; but the
soul by the nature of its essence can be united to the body, so that, properly
speaking, not the soul alone, but the &quot;composite,&quot; is the species.
And the very fact that the soul in a certain way requires the body for
its operation, proves that the soul is endowed with a grade of intellectuality
inferior to that of an angel, who is not united to a body. </B><BR wp="br1">

<P><B>I.76.1: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS UNITED TO THE BODY
AS ITS FORM? [This is an important question because granted that the intellect
can act and exist independently of matter, it is possible that individual
human beings lack such an intellect and that as a result individual human
beings are not immortal. This question was big during the Middle Ages and
is now important again since Buddhism and Hinduism makes us wonder whether
reincarnation is possible and whether it is possible for the self to continue
to exist as the self after death. If Aquinas is successful in identifying
the intellect as being within the soul of each person and if he is successful
in identifying the human soul as the form activating matter into the human
body, then he proves that human beings can be personally immortal without
being reincarnated. This proof begins in this article and is completed
in articles I.76.2-3-4-5-8] </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 2: Further, every form is determined according to the nature
of the matter of which it is the form; otherwise no proportion would be
required between matter and form. Therefore if the intellect were united
to the body as its form, since every body has a determinate nature, it
would follow that the intellect has a determinate nature; and thus, it
would not be capable of knowing all things, as is clear from what has been
said (Q75, A2); which is contrary to the nature of the intellect. Therefore
the intellect is not united to the body as its form. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 3: Further, whatever receptive power is an act of a body, receives
a form materially and individually; for what is received must be received
according to the condition of the receiver. But the form of the thing understood
is not received into the intellect materially and individually, but rather
immaterially and universally: otherwise the intellect would not be capable
of the knowledge of immaterial and universal objects, but only of individuals,
like the senses. Therefore the intellect is not united to the body as its
form. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 4: Further, power and action have the same subject; for the same
subject is what can, and does, act. But the intellectual action is not
the action of a body, as appears from above (Q75, A2). Therefore neither
is the intellectual faculty a power of the body. But virtue or power cannot
be more abstract or more simple than the essence from which the faculty
or power is derived. Therefore neither is the substance of the intellect
the form of a body. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, We must assert that the intellect which is the principle
of intellectual operation is the form of the human body. For that whereby
primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the act is to be
attributed: for instance, that whereby a body is primarily healed is health,
and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge; hence health is
a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the soul. The reason is
because nothing acts except so far as it is in act; therefore a thing acts
by that whereby it is in act. Now it is clear that the first thing by which
the body lives is the soul. And as life appears through various operations
in different degrees of living things, that whereby we primarily perform
each of all these vital actions is the soul. For the soul is the primary
principle of our nourishment, sensation, and local movement; and likewise
of our understanding. Therefore this principle by which we primarily understand,
whether it be called the intellect or the intellectual soul, is the form
of the body. This is the demonstration used by <I>Aristotle</I> (De Anima
ii, 2). </B></P>

<P><B>But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of
the body he must first explain how it is that this action of understanding
is the action of this particular man; for each one is conscious that it
is himself who understands. Now an action may be attributed to anyone in
three ways, as is clear from the Philosopher (Phys. v, 1); for a thing
is said to move or act, either by virtue of its whole self, for instance,
as a physician heals; or by virtue of a part, as a man sees by his eye;
or through an accidental quality, as when we say that something that is
white builds, because it is accidental to the builder to be white. So when
we say that Socrates or <I>Plato</I> understands, it is clear that this
is not attributed to him accidentally; since it is ascribed to him as man,
which is predicated of him essentially. We must therefore say either that
Socrates understands by virtue of his whole self, as <I>Plato</I> maintained,
holding that man is an intellectual soul; or that intelligence is a part
of Socrates. The first cannot stand, as was shown above (Q75, A4), for
this reason, that it is one and the same man who is conscious both that
he understands, and that he senses. But one cannot sense without a body:
therefore the body must be some part of man. It follows therefore that
the intellect by which Socrates understands is a part of Socrates, so that
in some way it is united to the body of Socrates. </B></P>

<P><B>The Commentator held that this union is through the <I>intelligible
species</I>, as having a double subject, in the possible intellect, and
in the sense images which are in the corporeal organs. Thus through the
<I>intelligible species</I> the possible intellect is linked to the body
of this or that particular man. But this link or union does not sufficiently
explain the fact, that the act of the intellect is the act of Socrates.
This can be clearly seen from comparison with the sensitive faculty, from
which <I>Aristotle</I> proceeds to consider things relating to the intellect.
For the relation of sense images to the intellect is like the relation
of colors to the sense of sight, as he says De Anima iii, 5,7. Therefore,
as the species of colors are in the sight, so are the species of sense
images in the possible intellect. Now it is clear that because the colors,
the images of which are in the sight, are on a wall, the action of seeing
is not attributed to the wall: for we do not say that the wall sees, but
rather that it is seen. Therefore, from the fact that the species of sense
images are in the possible intellect, it does not follow that Socrates,
in whom are the sense images, understands, but that he or his sense images
are understood. </B></P>

<P><B>Some, however, tried to maintain that the intellect is united to
the body as its motor; and hence that the intellect and body form one thing
so that the act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole. This
is, however, absurd for many reasons. First, because the intellect does
not move the body except through the appetite, the movement of which presupposes
the operation of the intellect. The reason therefore why Socrates understands
is not because he is moved by his intellect, but rather, contrariwise,
he is moved by his intellect because he understands. Secondly, because
since Socrates is an individual in a nature of one essence composed of
matter and form, if the intellect be not the form, it follows that it must
be outside the essence, and then the intellect is the whole Socrates as
a motor to the thing moved. Whereas the act of intellect remains in the
agent, and does not pass into something else, as does the action of heating.
Therefore the action of understanding cannot be attributed to Socrates
for the reason that he is moved by his intellect. Thirdly, because the
action of a motor is never attributed to the thing moved, except as to
an instrument; as the action of a carpenter to a saw. Therefore if understanding
is attributed to Socrates, as the action of what moves him, it follows
that it is attributed to him as to an instrument. This is contrary to the
teaching of the Philosopher, who holds that understanding is not possible
through a corporeal instrument (De Anima iii, 4). Fourthly, because, although
the action of a part be attributed to the whole, as the action of the eye
is attributed to a man; yet it is never attributed to another part, except
perhaps indirectly; for we do not say that the hand sees because the eye
sees. Therefore if the intellect and Socrates are united in the above manner,
the action of the intellect cannot be attributed to Socrates. If, however,
Socrates be a whole composed of a union of the intellect with whatever
else belongs to Socrates, and still the intellect be united to those other
things only as a motor, it follows that Socrates is not one absolutely,
and consequently neither a being absolutely, for a thing is a being according
as it is one. </B></P>

<P><B>There remains, therefore, no other explanation than that given by
Aristotle---namely, that this particular man understands, because the intellectual
principle is his form. Thus from the very operation of the intellect it
is made clear that the intellectual principle is united to the body as
its form. </B></P>

<P><B>The same can be clearly shown from the nature of the human species.
For the nature of each thing is shown by its operation. Now the proper
operation of man as man is to understand; because he thereby surpasses
all other animals. Whence <I>Aristotle</I> concludes (Ethic. x, 7) that
the ultimate happiness of man must consist in this operation as properly
belonging to him. Man must therefore derive his species from that which
is the principle of this operation. But the species of anything is derived
from its form. It follows therefore that the intellectual principle is
the proper form of man. </B></P>

<P><B>But we must observe that the nobler a form is, the more it rises
above corporeal matter, the less it is merged in matter, and the more it
excels matter by its power and its operation; hence we find that the form
of a mixed body has another operation not caused by its elemental qualities.
And the higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find that
the power of the form excels the elementary matter; as the vegetative soul
excels the form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excels the vegetative
soul. Now the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms. Therefore
it excels corporeal matter in its power by the fact that it has an operation
and a power in which corporeal matter has no share whatever. This power
is called the intellect. </B></P>

<P><B>It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soul is composed
of matter and form, it would follow that in no way could the soul be the
form of the body. For since the form is an act, and matter is only in potentiality,
that which is composed of matter and form cannot itself be the form of
another by virtue of itself as a whole. </B><BR wp="br1">

</P>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 2 &amp; 3: From this it is clear how to answer the Second
and Third objections: since, in order that man may be able to understand
all things by means of his intellect, and that his intellect may understand
immaterial things and universals, it is sufficient that the intellectual
power be not the act of the body. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 4: The human soul, by reason of its perfection, is not
a form merged in matter, or entirely embraced by matter. Therefore there
is nothing to prevent some power thereof not being the act of the body,
although the soul is essentially the form of the body. </B><BR wp="br1">

<P><B>I.76.2: WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HUMAN BEINGS SHARE ONE INTELLECT?
</B></P>

<P><B>[If Aquinas were to claim that humans share one intellect, then his
philosophy would be analogous to the belief that the soul is Brahman. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, It is absolutely impossible for one intellect to belong
to all men. This is clear if, as <I>Plato</I> maintained, man is the intellect
itself. For it would follow that Socrates and <I>Plato</I> are one man;
and that they are not distinct from each other, except by something outside
the essence of each. The distinction between <I>Socrates</I> and <I>Plato</I>
would be no other than that of one man with a tunic and another with a
cloak; which is quite absurd. </B></P>

<P><B>It is likewise clear that this is impossible if, according to the
opinion of <I>Aristotle</I> (De Anima ii, 2), it is supposed that the intellect
is a part or a power of the soul which is the form of man. For it is impossible
for many distinct individuals to have one form, as it is impossible for
them to have one existence, for the form is the principle of existence.
</B></P>

<P><B>Again, this is clearly impossible, whatever one may hold as to the
manner of the union of the intellect to this or that man. For it is manifest
that .... if there is one intellect, no matter how diverse may be all those
things of which the intellect makes use as instruments, in no way is it
possible to say that <I>Socrates</I> and <I>Plato</I> are otherwise than
one understanding man. And if to this we add that to understand, which
is the act of the intellect, is not affected by any organ other than the
intellect itself; it will further follow that there is but one agent and
one action: that is to say that all men are but one &quot;understander,&quot;
and have but one act of understanding, in regard, that is, of one intelligible
object. .... It follows, therefore, that it is altogether impossible and
unreasonable to maintain that there exists one intellect for all men. </B><BR wp="br1">

<P><B>I. 76.3: WHETHER BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN OTHER
SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER? </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>OBJ 1: It would seem that besides the intellectual soul there are
in man other souls essentially different from one another, such as the
sensitive soul and the nutritive soul. For corruptible and incorruptible
are not of the same substance. But the intellectual soul is incorruptible;
whereas the other souls, as the sensitive and the nutritive, are corruptible,
as was shown above (Q75, A6). Therefore in man the essence of the intellectual
soul, the sensitive soul, and the nutritive soul, cannot be the same. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
<BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, <I>Plato</I> held that there were several souls in
one body, distinct even as to organs, to which souls he referred the different
vital actions, saying that the nutritive power is in the liver, the concupiscible
in the heart, and the power of knowledge in the brain. Which opinion is
rejected by <I>Aristotle</I> (De Anima ii, 2), with regard to those parts
of the soul which use corporeal organs; for this reason, that in those
animals which continue to live when they have been divided in each part
are observed the operations of the soul, as sense and appetite. Now this
would not be the case if the various principles of the soul's operations
were essentially different, and distributed in the various parts of the
body. But with regard to the intellectual part, he seems to leave it in
doubt whether it be &quot;only logically&quot; distinct from the other
parts of the soul, &quot;or also locally.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>The opinion of <I>Plato</I> might be maintained if, as he held, the
soul was supposed to be united to the body, not as its form, but as its
motor. For it involves nothing unreasonable that the same movable thing
be moved by several motors; and still less if it be moved according to
its various parts. If we suppose, however, that the soul is united to the
body as its form, it is quite impossible for several essentially different
souls to be in one body. This can be made clear by <I>three different reasons.</I>
</B></P>

<P><B>In the <I>first</I> place, an animal would not be absolutely one,
in which there were several souls. For nothing is absolutely one except
by one form, by which a thing has existence: because a thing has from the
same source both existence and unity; and therefore things which are denominated
by various forms are not absolutely one; as, for instance, &quot;a white
man.&quot; If, therefore, man were 'living' by one form, the vegetative
soul, and 'animal' by another form, the sensitive soul, and &quot;man&quot;
by another form, the intellectual soul, it would follow that man is not
absolutely one. Thus <I>Aristotle</I> argues, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6),
against <I>Plato</I>, that if the idea of an animal is distinct from the
idea of a biped, then a biped animal is not absolutely one. For this reason,
against those who hold that there are several souls in the body, he asks
(De Anima i, 5), &quot;what contains them?&quot;---that is, what makes
them one? It cannot be said that they are united by the one body; because
rather does the soul contain the body and make it one, than the reverse.
</B></P>

<P><B><I>Secondly</I>, .... <I>Thirdly</I>, this is shown to be impossible
by the fact that when one operation of the soul is intense it impedes another,
which could never be the case unless the principle of action were essentially
one. </B></P>

<P><B>We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul, the intellectual
soul, and the nutritive soul are numerically one soul. This can easily
be explained, if we consider the differences of species and forms. For
we observe that the species and forms of things differ from one another,
as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the animate are
more perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect than plants,
and man than brute animals; and in each of these genera there are various
degrees. .... </B></P>

<P><B>Thus, neither is <I>Socrates</I> a man by one soul, and animal by
another; but by one and the same soul he is both animal and man. </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>Reply OBJ 1: The sensitive soul is incorruptible, not by reason of
its being sensitive, but by reason of its being intellectual. When, therefore,
a soul is sensitive only, it is corruptible; but when with sensibility
it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible. For although sensibility
does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot deprive intellectuality of
its incorruptibility. [In other words, the intellectual soul can do what
purely sentient and purely vegetative souls can do without being limited
to the functions of these lower souls. Cf. I.76.4c &quot;. . .there is
no other <I>substantial form</I> in man besides the intellectual soul;
and that the soul, as it virtually contains the sensitive and nutritive
souls, so does it virtually contain all inferior forms, and itself alone
does whatever the imperfect forms do in other things. The same is to be
said of the sensitive soul in brute animals, and of the nutritive soul
in plants, and universally of all more perfect forms with regard to the
imperfect.&quot; </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>ARTICLE COMMENTARY: If Aquinas is correct in arguing that every human
being has only one soul, then it is impossible for &quot;humanoid animals&quot;
to exist (i.e. no human body can be kept alive without the animating presence
of the intellectual soul). Death thus occurs when the soul ceases to animate
matter into a living body. This means that when some one suffers &quot;neocortical
death&quot; they are still alive even though the brain's destruction precludes
thought. It thus becomes matter of ethics to decide how to treat such persons
appropriately. See the following article for additional clarification.

<P><B>I.76.8: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IN EACH PART OF THE BODY? </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, As we have said, if the soul were united to the body
merely as its motor, we might say that it is not in each part of the body,
but only in one part through which it would move the others. But since
the soul is united to the body as its form, it must necessarily be in the
whole body, and in each part thereof. For it is not an <I>accidental form</I>,
but the <I>substantial form</I> of the body. Now the <I>substantial form</I>
perfects not only the whole, but each part of the whole. For since a whole
consists of parts, a form of the whole which does not give existence to
each of the parts of the body, is a form consisting in composition and
order, such as the form of a house; and such a form is accidental. But
the soul is a <I>substantial form</I>; and therefore it must be the form
and the act, not only of the whole, but also of each part. Therefore, on
the withdrawal of the soul, as we do not speak of an animal or a man unless
equivocally, as we speak of a painted animal or a stone animal; so is it
with the hand, the eye, the flesh and bones, as the Philosopher says (De
Anima ii, 1). A proof of which is, that <I>on the withdrawal of the soul,
no part of the body retains its proper action</I>; although that which
retains its species, retains the action of the species. But act is in that
which it actuates: <I>therefore</I> the soul must be in the whole body,
and in each part thereof. </B><BR wp="br1">

<P><B>I.76.5: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS PROPERLY UNITED TO SUCH
A BODY? </B><BR wp="br1">
<BR wp="br2">
</P>

<P><B>I answer that, ... Now the intellectual soul, as we have seen above
(Q55, A2) in the order of nature, holds the lowest place among intellectual
substances; inasmuch as it is not naturally gifted with the knowledge of
truth, as the angels are; but has to gather knowledge from individual things
by way of the senses, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii). But nature never
fails in necessary things: therefore the intellectual soul had to be endowed
not only with the power of understanding, but also with the power of feeling.
Now the action of the senses is not performed without a corporeal instrument.
Therefore it behooved the intellectual soul to be united to a body fitted
to be a convenient organ of sense. </B></P>
