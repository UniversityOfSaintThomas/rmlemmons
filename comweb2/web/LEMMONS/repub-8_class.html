VIII</B></CENTER>

<CENTER>By Plato&nbsp;<A NAME="3"></A></CENTER>

<CENTER>Written 360 B.C.E</CENTER>
Translated by Benjamin Jowett

<P><A NAME="start"></A><A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="11"></A>

<P>And so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the&nbsp;<A NAME="12"></A>perfect
State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education&nbsp;<A NAME="13"></A>and
the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best philosophers&nbsp;<A NAME="14"></A>and
the bravest warriors are to be their kings?&nbsp;<A NAME="15"></A>

<P>That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.&nbsp;<A NAME="16"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when&nbsp;<A NAME="17"></A>appointed
themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses&nbsp;<A NAME="18"></A>such
as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="19"></A>private,
or individual; and about their property, you remember what we&nbsp;<A NAME="20"></A>agreed?&nbsp;<A NAME="21"></A>

<P>Yes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions&nbsp;<A NAME="22"></A>of
mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving from&nbsp;<A NAME="23"></A>the
other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance,&nbsp;<A NAME="24"></A>and
they were to take care of themselves and of the whole&nbsp;<A NAME="25"></A>State.&nbsp;<A NAME="26"></A>

<P>True, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded,&nbsp;<A NAME="27"></A>let
us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the&nbsp;<A NAME="28"></A>old
path.&nbsp;<A NAME="29"></A>

<P>There is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now,&nbsp;<A NAME="30"></A>that
you had finished the description of the State: you said that such&nbsp;<A NAME="31"></A>a
State was good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although,&nbsp;<A NAME="32"></A>as
now appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of State and&nbsp;<A NAME="33"></A>man.
And you said further, that if this was the true form, then the others&nbsp;<A NAME="34"></A>were
false; and of the false forms, you said, as I remember, that there&nbsp;<A NAME="35"></A>were
four principal ones, and that their defects, and the defects of the&nbsp;<A NAME="36"></A>individuals
corresponding to them, were worth examining. When we had seen&nbsp;<A NAME="37"></A>all
the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was the best and who&nbsp;<A NAME="38"></A>was
the worst of them, we were to consider whether the best was not also&nbsp;<A NAME="39"></A>the
happiest, and the worst the most miserable. I asked you what were the&nbsp;<A NAME="40"></A>four
forms of government of which you spoke, and then Polemarchus and Adeimantus&nbsp;<A NAME="41"></A>put
in their word; and you began again, and have found your way to the&nbsp;<A NAME="42"></A>point
at which we have now arrived.&nbsp;<A NAME="43"></A>

<P>Your recollection, I said, is most exact.&nbsp;<A NAME="44"></A>
<BR>Then, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in the&nbsp;<A NAME="45"></A>same
position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me the&nbsp;<A NAME="46"></A>same
answer which you were about to give me then.&nbsp;<A NAME="47"></A>

<P>....
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions&nbsp;<A NAME="65"></A>of
men vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of&nbsp;<A NAME="66"></A>the
other? For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,'&nbsp;<A NAME="67"></A>and
not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure&nbsp;<A NAME="68"></A>turn
the scale and draw other things after them?&nbsp;<A NAME="69"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human&nbsp;<A NAME="70"></A>characters.&nbsp;<A NAME="71"></A>

<P>Then if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions&nbsp;<A NAME="72"></A>of
individual minds will also be five?&nbsp;<A NAME="73"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="74"></A>
<BR>Him who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly call just and good,&nbsp;<A NAME="75"></A>we
have already described.&nbsp;<A NAME="76"></A>

<P>We have.&nbsp;<A NAME="77"></A>
<BR>Then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being&nbsp;<A NAME="78"></A>the
contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity; also the&nbsp;<A NAME="79"></A>oligarchical,
democratical, and tyrannical. Let us place the most just&nbsp;<A NAME="80"></A>by
the side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be able to&nbsp;<A NAME="81"></A>compare
the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of&nbsp;<A NAME="82"></A>pure
justice or pure injustice. The enquiry will then be completed. And&nbsp;<A NAME="83"></A>we
shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice, as Thrasymachus advises,&nbsp;<A NAME="84"></A>or
in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer&nbsp;<A NAME="85"></A>justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="86"></A>

<P>Certainly, he replied, we must do as you say.&nbsp;<A NAME="87"></A>
<BR>Shall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to clearness,&nbsp;<A NAME="88"></A>of
taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual, and begin&nbsp;<A NAME="89"></A>with
the government of honour? --I know of no name for such a government&nbsp;<A NAME="90"></A>other
than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We will compare with this the&nbsp;<A NAME="91"></A>like
character in the individual; and, after that, consider oligarchical&nbsp;<A NAME="92"></A>man;
and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical&nbsp;<A NAME="93"></A>man;
and lastly, we will go and view the city of tyranny, and once more&nbsp;<A NAME="94"></A>take
a look into the tyrant's soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory&nbsp;<A NAME="95"></A>decision.&nbsp;<A NAME="96"></A>

<P>That way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very&nbsp;<A NAME="97"></A>suitable.&nbsp;<A NAME="98"></A>
<BR>First, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government of&nbsp;<A NAME="99"></A>honour)
arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best). Clearly,&nbsp;<A NAME="100"></A>all
political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power;&nbsp;<A NAME="101"></A>a
government which is united, however small, cannot be&nbsp;<A NAME="102"></A>moved.&nbsp;<A NAME="103"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="104"></A>&nbsp; . . . .

<P>. . . . . .
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Next comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to be&nbsp;<A NAME="517"></A>considered
by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic&nbsp;<A NAME="518"></A>man,
and bring him up for judgement.&nbsp;<A NAME="519"></A>

<P>That, he said, is our method.&nbsp;<A NAME="520"></A>
<BR>Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy&nbsp;<A NAME="521"></A>arise?
Is it not on this wise? --The good at which such a State alms is&nbsp;<A NAME="522"></A>to
become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?&nbsp;<A NAME="523"></A>

<P>What then?&nbsp;<A NAME="524"></A>
<BR>The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse&nbsp;<A NAME="525"></A>to
curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they&nbsp;<A NAME="526"></A>gain
by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates&nbsp;<A NAME="527"></A>and
thus increase their own wealth and importance?&nbsp;<A NAME="528"></A>

<P>To be sure.&nbsp;<A NAME="529"></A>
<BR>There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation&nbsp;<A NAME="530"></A>cannot
exist together in citizens of the same State to any considerable&nbsp;<A NAME="531"></A>extent;
one or the other will be disregarded.&nbsp;<A NAME="532"></A>

<P>That is tolerably clear.&nbsp;<A NAME="533"></A>
<BR>And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness&nbsp;<A NAME="534"></A>and
extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to&nbsp;<A NAME="535"></A>beggary?&nbsp;<A NAME="536"></A>

<P>Yes, often.&nbsp;<A NAME="537"></A>
<BR>And still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and&nbsp;<A NAME="538"></A>fully
armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their citizenship;&nbsp;<A NAME="539"></A>a
third class are in both predicaments; and they hate and conspire against&nbsp;<A NAME="540"></A>those
who have got their property, and against everybody else, and are&nbsp;<A NAME="541"></A>eager
for revolution.&nbsp;<A NAME="542"></A>

<P>That is true.&nbsp;<A NAME="543"></A>
<BR>On the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and&nbsp;<A NAME="544"></A>pretending
not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert&nbsp;<A NAME="545"></A>their
sting --that is, their money --into some one else who is not on his&nbsp;<A NAME="546"></A>guard
against them, and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied&nbsp;<A NAME="547"></A>into
a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper to abound&nbsp;<A NAME="548"></A>in
the State.&nbsp;<A NAME="549"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, there are plenty of them --that is&nbsp;<A NAME="550"></A>certain.&nbsp;<A NAME="551"></A>
<BR>The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either&nbsp;<A NAME="552"></A>by
restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another&nbsp;<A NAME="553"></A>remedy:&nbsp;<A NAME="554"></A>

<P>What other?&nbsp;<A NAME="555"></A>
<BR>One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the&nbsp;<A NAME="556"></A>citizens
to look to their characters: --Let there be a general rule that&nbsp;<A NAME="557"></A>every
one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and there&nbsp;<A NAME="558"></A>will
be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of which we&nbsp;<A NAME="559"></A>were
speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.&nbsp;<A NAME="560"></A>

<P>Yes, they will be greatly lessened.&nbsp;<A NAME="561"></A>
<BR>At present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named,&nbsp;<A NAME="562"></A>treat
their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially&nbsp;<A NAME="563"></A>the
young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of&nbsp;<A NAME="564"></A>luxury
and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are incapable&nbsp;<A NAME="565"></A>of
resisting either pleasure or pain.&nbsp;<A NAME="566"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="567"></A>
<BR>They themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent&nbsp;<A NAME="568"></A>as
the pauper to the cultivation of virtue.&nbsp;<A NAME="569"></A>

<P>Yes, quite as indifferent.&nbsp;<A NAME="570"></A>
<BR>Such is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often rulers&nbsp;<A NAME="571"></A>and
their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on a pilgrimage&nbsp;<A NAME="572"></A>or
a march, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye, and they may observe&nbsp;<A NAME="573"></A>the
behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger --for where danger&nbsp;<A NAME="574"></A>is,
there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich --and very&nbsp;<A NAME="575"></A>likely
the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of&nbsp;<A NAME="576"></A>a
wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous&nbsp;<A NAME="577"></A>flesh
--when he sees such an one puffing and at his wit's end, how can&nbsp;<A NAME="578"></A>he
avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because&nbsp;<A NAME="579"></A>no
one has the courage to despoil them? And when they meet in private will&nbsp;<A NAME="580"></A>not
people be saying to one another 'Our warriors are not good for&nbsp;<A NAME="581"></A>much'?&nbsp;<A NAME="582"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of&nbsp;<A NAME="583"></A>talking.&nbsp;<A NAME="584"></A>
<BR>And, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without&nbsp;<A NAME="585"></A>may
bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external provocation&nbsp;<A NAME="586"></A>a
commotion may arise within-in the same way wherever there is weakness&nbsp;<A NAME="587"></A>in
the State there is also likely to be illness, of which the occasions&nbsp;<A NAME="588"></A>may
be very slight, the one party introducing from without their oligarchical,&nbsp;<A NAME="589"></A>the
other their democratical allies, and then the State falls sick, and&nbsp;<A NAME="590"></A>is
at war with herself; and may be at times distracted, even when there&nbsp;<A NAME="591"></A>is
no external cause.&nbsp;<A NAME="592"></A>

<P>Yes, surely.&nbsp;<A NAME="593"></A>
<BR>And then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their&nbsp;<A NAME="594"></A>opponents,
slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder&nbsp;<A NAME="595"></A>they
give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of&nbsp;<A NAME="596"></A>government
in which the magistrates are commonly elected by&nbsp;<A NAME="597"></A>lot.&nbsp;<A NAME="598"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution&nbsp;<A NAME="599"></A>has
been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite party&nbsp;<A NAME="600"></A>to
withdraw.&nbsp;<A NAME="601"></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
