Translated by Benjamin Jowett<A NAME="start"></A><A NAME="10"></A>Socrates
- GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="11"></A>

<P>Of he many excellences which I perceive in the order of our State,&nbsp;<A NAME="12"></A>there
is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about&nbsp;<A NAME="13"></A>poetry.&nbsp;<A NAME="14"></A>

<P>To what do you refer?&nbsp;<A NAME="15"></A>
<BR>To the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to&nbsp;<A NAME="16"></A>be
received; as I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have&nbsp;<A NAME="17"></A>been
distinguished.&nbsp;<A NAME="18"></A>

<P>What do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="19"></A>
<BR>Speaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words repeated&nbsp;<A NAME="20"></A>to
the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe --but I do not mind&nbsp;<A NAME="21"></A>saying
to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding&nbsp;<A NAME="22"></A>of
the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only&nbsp;<A NAME="23"></A>antidote
to them.&nbsp;<A NAME="24"></A>

<P>Explain the purport of your remark.&nbsp;<A NAME="25"></A>
<BR>Well, I will tell you, although I have always from my earliest youth&nbsp;<A NAME="26"></A>had
an awe and love of Homer, which even now makes the words falter on&nbsp;<A NAME="27"></A>my
lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming&nbsp;<A NAME="28"></A>tragic
company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth,&nbsp;<A NAME="29"></A>and
therefore I will speak out.&nbsp;<A NAME="30"></A>

<P>Very good, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="31"></A>
<BR>Listen to me then, or rather, answer me.&nbsp;<A NAME="32"></A>
<BR>Put your question.&nbsp;<A NAME="33"></A>
<BR>Can you tell me what imitation is? for I really do not&nbsp;<A NAME="34"></A>know.&nbsp;<A NAME="35"></A>
<BR>A likely thing, then, that I should know.&nbsp;<A NAME="36"></A>
<BR>Why not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the&nbsp;<A NAME="37"></A>keener.&nbsp;<A NAME="38"></A>

<P>Very true, he said; but in your presence, even if I had any faint&nbsp;<A NAME="39"></A>notion,
I could not muster courage to utter it. Will you enquire&nbsp;<A NAME="40"></A>yourself?&nbsp;<A NAME="41"></A>

<P>Well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever&nbsp;<A NAME="42"></A>a
number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also&nbsp;<A NAME="43"></A>a
corresponding idea or form. Do you understand me?&nbsp;<A NAME="44"></A>

<P>I do.&nbsp;<A NAME="45"></A>
<BR>Let us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the world&nbsp;<A NAME="46"></A>--plenty
of them, are there not?&nbsp;<A NAME="47"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="48"></A>
<BR>But there are only two ideas or forms of them --one the idea of a bed,&nbsp;<A NAME="49"></A>the
other of a table.&nbsp;<A NAME="50"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="51"></A>
<BR>And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for&nbsp;<A NAME="52"></A>our
use, in accordance with the idea --that is our way of speaking in this&nbsp;<A NAME="53"></A>and
similar instances --but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how&nbsp;<A NAME="54"></A>could
he?&nbsp;<A NAME="55"></A>

<P>Impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="56"></A>
<BR>And there is another artist, --I should like to know what you would&nbsp;<A NAME="57"></A>say
of him.&nbsp;<A NAME="58"></A>

<P>Who is he?&nbsp;<A NAME="59"></A>
<BR>One who is the maker of all the works of all other&nbsp;<A NAME="60"></A>workmen.&nbsp;<A NAME="61"></A>
<BR>What an extraordinary man!&nbsp;<A NAME="62"></A>
<BR>Wait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. For&nbsp;<A NAME="63"></A>this
is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but plants&nbsp;<A NAME="64"></A>and
animals, himself and all other things --the earth and heaven, and the&nbsp;<A NAME="65"></A>things
which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="66"></A>also.&nbsp;<A NAME="67"></A>

<P>He must be a wizard and no mistake.&nbsp;<A NAME="68"></A>
<BR>Oh! you are incredulous, are you? Do you mean that there is no such&nbsp;<A NAME="69"></A>maker
or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these&nbsp;<A NAME="70"></A>things
but in another not? Do you see that there is a way in which you&nbsp;<A NAME="71"></A>could
make them all yourself?&nbsp;<A NAME="72"></A>

<P>What way?&nbsp;<A NAME="73"></A>
<BR>An easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat&nbsp;<A NAME="74"></A>might
be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of turning&nbsp;<A NAME="75"></A>a
mirror round and round --you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens,&nbsp;<A NAME="76"></A>and
the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants, and all the,&nbsp;<A NAME="77"></A>other
things of which we were just now speaking, in the&nbsp;<A NAME="78"></A>mirror.&nbsp;<A NAME="79"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; but they would be appearances&nbsp;<A NAME="80"></A>only.&nbsp;<A NAME="81"></A>
<BR>Very good, I said, you are coming to the point now. And the painter&nbsp;<A NAME="82"></A>too
is, as I conceive, just such another --a creator of appearances, is&nbsp;<A NAME="83"></A>he
not?&nbsp;<A NAME="84"></A>

<P>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="85"></A>
<BR>But then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. And&nbsp;<A NAME="86"></A>yet
there is a sense in which the painter also creates a&nbsp;<A NAME="87"></A>bed?&nbsp;<A NAME="88"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, but not a real bed.&nbsp;<A NAME="89"></A>
<BR>And what of the maker of the bed? Were you not saying that he too makes,&nbsp;<A NAME="90"></A>not
the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but&nbsp;<A NAME="91"></A>only
a particular bed?&nbsp;<A NAME="92"></A>

<P>Yes, I did.&nbsp;<A NAME="93"></A>
<BR>Then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence,&nbsp;<A NAME="94"></A>but
only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to say that the&nbsp;<A NAME="95"></A>work
of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has real existence,&nbsp;<A NAME="96"></A>he
could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="97"></A>

<P>At any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not&nbsp;<A NAME="98"></A>speaking
the truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="99"></A>

<P>No wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression&nbsp;<A NAME="100"></A>of
truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="101"></A>

<P>No wonder.&nbsp;<A NAME="102"></A>
<BR>Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire&nbsp;<A NAME="103"></A>who
this imitator is?&nbsp;<A NAME="104"></A>

<P>If you please.&nbsp;<A NAME="105"></A>
<BR>Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made&nbsp;<A NAME="106"></A>by
God, as I think that we may say --for no one else can be the&nbsp;<A NAME="107"></A>maker?&nbsp;<A NAME="108"></A>

<P>No.&nbsp;<A NAME="109"></A>
<BR>There is another which is the work of the carpenter?&nbsp;<A NAME="110"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="111"></A>
<BR>And the work of the painter is a third?&nbsp;<A NAME="112"></A>
<BR>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="113"></A>
<BR>Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who superintend&nbsp;<A NAME="114"></A>them:
God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?&nbsp;<A NAME="115"></A>

<P>Yes, there are three of them.&nbsp;<A NAME="116"></A>
<BR>God, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature&nbsp;<A NAME="117"></A>and
one only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever&nbsp;<A NAME="118"></A>will
be made by God.&nbsp;<A NAME="119"></A>

<P>Why is that?&nbsp;<A NAME="120"></A>
<BR>Because even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind&nbsp;<A NAME="121"></A>them
which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the&nbsp;<A NAME="122"></A>ideal
bed and the two others.&nbsp;<A NAME="123"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="124"></A>
<BR>God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not&nbsp;<A NAME="125"></A>a
particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed&nbsp;<A NAME="126"></A>which
is essentially and by nature one only.&nbsp;<A NAME="127"></A>

<P>So we believe.&nbsp;<A NAME="128"></A>
<BR>Shall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the&nbsp;<A NAME="129"></A>bed?&nbsp;<A NAME="130"></A>

<P>Yes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation&nbsp;<A NAME="131"></A>He
is the author of this and of all other things.&nbsp;<A NAME="132"></A>

<P>And what shall we say of the carpenter --is not he also the maker&nbsp;<A NAME="133"></A>of
the bed?&nbsp;<A NAME="134"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="135"></A>
<BR>But would you call the painter a creator and maker?&nbsp;<A NAME="136"></A>
<BR>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="137"></A>
<BR>Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the&nbsp;<A NAME="138"></A>bed?&nbsp;<A NAME="139"></A>
<BR>I think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator&nbsp;<A NAME="140"></A>of
that which the others make.&nbsp;<A NAME="141"></A>

<P>Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from&nbsp;<A NAME="142"></A>nature
an imitator?&nbsp;<A NAME="143"></A>

<P>Certainly, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="144"></A>
<BR>And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other imitators,&nbsp;<A NAME="145"></A>he
is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?&nbsp;<A NAME="146"></A>

<P>That appears to be so.&nbsp;<A NAME="147"></A>
<BR>Then about the imitator we are agreed. And what about the painter?&nbsp;<A NAME="148"></A>--I
would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which&nbsp;<A NAME="149"></A>originally
exists in nature, or only the creations of&nbsp;<A NAME="150"></A>artists?&nbsp;<A NAME="151"></A>

<P>The latter.&nbsp;<A NAME="152"></A>
<BR>As they are or as they appear? You have still to determine&nbsp;<A NAME="153"></A>this.&nbsp;<A NAME="154"></A>
<BR>What do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="155"></A>
<BR>I mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view, obliquely&nbsp;<A NAME="156"></A>or
directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will appear different,&nbsp;<A NAME="157"></A>but
there is no difference in reality. And the same of all&nbsp;<A NAME="158"></A>things.&nbsp;<A NAME="159"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, the difference is only apparent.&nbsp;<A NAME="160"></A>
<BR>Now let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting designed&nbsp;<A NAME="161"></A>to
be --an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear --of appearance&nbsp;<A NAME="162"></A>or
of reality?&nbsp;<A NAME="163"></A>

<P>Of appearance.&nbsp;<A NAME="164"></A>
<BR>Then the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do&nbsp;<A NAME="165"></A>all
things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that&nbsp;<A NAME="166"></A>part
an image. For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter,&nbsp;<A NAME="167"></A>or
any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he&nbsp;<A NAME="168"></A>is
a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows&nbsp;<A NAME="169"></A>them
his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy that&nbsp;<A NAME="170"></A>they
are looking at a real carpenter.&nbsp;<A NAME="171"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="172"></A>
<BR>And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the&nbsp;<A NAME="173"></A>arts,
and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with&nbsp;<A NAME="174"></A>a
higher degree of accuracy than any other man --whoever tells us this,&nbsp;<A NAME="175"></A>I
think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely&nbsp;<A NAME="176"></A>to
have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he&nbsp;<A NAME="177"></A>thought
all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse the nature&nbsp;<A NAME="178"></A>of
knowledge and ignorance and imitation.&nbsp;<A NAME="179"></A>

<P>Most true.&nbsp;<A NAME="180"></A>
<BR>And so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer,&nbsp;<A NAME="181"></A>who
is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as&nbsp;<A NAME="182"></A>well
as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose&nbsp;<A NAME="183"></A>well
unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="184"></A>can
never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may not&nbsp;<A NAME="185"></A>be
a similar illusion. Perhaps they may have come across imitators and&nbsp;<A NAME="186"></A>been
deceived by them; they may not have remembered when they saw their&nbsp;<A NAME="187"></A>works
that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth, and&nbsp;<A NAME="188"></A>could
easily be made without any knowledge of the truth, because they are&nbsp;<A NAME="189"></A>appearances
only and not realities? Or, after all, they may be in the right,&nbsp;<A NAME="190"></A>and
poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to&nbsp;<A NAME="191"></A>speak
so well?&nbsp;<A NAME="192"></A>

<P>The question, he said, should by all means be&nbsp;<A NAME="193"></A>considered.&nbsp;<A NAME="194"></A>
<BR>Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original&nbsp;<A NAME="195"></A>as
well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making&nbsp;<A NAME="196"></A>branch?
Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life,&nbsp;<A NAME="197"></A>as
if he had nothing higher in him?&nbsp;<A NAME="198"></A>

<P>I should say not.&nbsp;<A NAME="199"></A>
<BR>The real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested&nbsp;<A NAME="200"></A>in
realities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials&nbsp;<A NAME="201"></A>of
himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of encomiums,&nbsp;<A NAME="202"></A>he
would prefer to be the theme of them.&nbsp;<A NAME="203"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour&nbsp;<A NAME="204"></A>and
profit.&nbsp;<A NAME="205"></A>

<P>Then, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about medicine,&nbsp;<A NAME="206"></A>or
any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not&nbsp;<A NAME="207"></A>going
to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients like&nbsp;<A NAME="208"></A>Asclepius,
or left behind him a school of medicine such as the Asclepiads&nbsp;<A NAME="209"></A>were,
or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at second&nbsp;<A NAME="210"></A>hand;
but we have a right to know respecting military tactics, politics,&nbsp;<A NAME="211"></A>education,
which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his poems, and&nbsp;<A NAME="212"></A>we
may fairly ask him about them. 'Friend Homer,' then we say to him, 'if&nbsp;<A NAME="213"></A>you
are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue,&nbsp;<A NAME="214"></A>and
not in the third --not an image maker or imitator --and if you are&nbsp;<A NAME="215"></A>able
to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public&nbsp;<A NAME="216"></A>life,
tell us what State was ever better governed by your help? The good&nbsp;<A NAME="217"></A>order
of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many other cities great and&nbsp;<A NAME="218"></A>small
have been similarly benefited by others; but who says that you have&nbsp;<A NAME="219"></A>been
a good legislator to them and have done them any good? Italy and Sicily&nbsp;<A NAME="220"></A>boast
of Charondas, and there is Solon who is renowned among us; but what&nbsp;<A NAME="221"></A>city
has anything to say about you?' Is there any city which he might&nbsp;<A NAME="222"></A>name?&nbsp;<A NAME="223"></A>

<P>I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend&nbsp;<A NAME="224"></A>that
he was a legislator.&nbsp;<A NAME="225"></A>

<P>Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully&nbsp;<A NAME="226"></A>by
him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?&nbsp;<A NAME="227"></A>

<P>There is not.&nbsp;<A NAME="228"></A>
<BR>Or is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human&nbsp;<A NAME="229"></A>life,
such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other&nbsp;<A NAME="230"></A>ingenious
men have conceived, which is attributed to&nbsp;<A NAME="231"></A>him?&nbsp;<A NAME="232"></A>

<P>There is absolutely nothing of the kind.&nbsp;<A NAME="233"></A>
<BR>But, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide&nbsp;<A NAME="234"></A>or
teacher of any? Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate&nbsp;<A NAME="235"></A>with
him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such&nbsp;<A NAME="236"></A>as
was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom,&nbsp;<A NAME="237"></A>and
whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which&nbsp;<A NAME="238"></A>was
named after him?&nbsp;<A NAME="239"></A>

<P>Nothing of the kind is recorded of him. For surely, Socrates, Creophylus,&nbsp;<A NAME="240"></A>the
companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name always makes us&nbsp;<A NAME="241"></A>laugh,
might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity, if, as is said,&nbsp;<A NAME="242"></A>Homer
was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was&nbsp;<A NAME="243"></A>alive?&nbsp;<A NAME="244"></A>

<P>Yes, I replied, that is the tradition. But can you imagine, Glaucon,&nbsp;<A NAME="245"></A>that
if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind --if&nbsp;<A NAME="246"></A>he
had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator --can you imagine,&nbsp;<A NAME="247"></A>I
say, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and&nbsp;<A NAME="248"></A>loved
by them? Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos, and a host of&nbsp;<A NAME="249"></A>others,
have only to whisper to their contemporaries: 'You will never be&nbsp;<A NAME="250"></A>able
to manage either your own house or your own State until you appoint&nbsp;<A NAME="251"></A>us
to be your ministers of education' --and this ingenious device of theirs&nbsp;<A NAME="252"></A>has
such an effect in making them love them that their companions all but&nbsp;<A NAME="253"></A>carry
them about on their shoulders. And is it conceivable that the contemporaries&nbsp;<A NAME="254"></A>of
Homer, or again of Hesiod, would have allowed either of them to go about&nbsp;<A NAME="255"></A>as
rhapsodists, if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous?&nbsp;<A NAME="256"></A>Would
they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and&nbsp;<A NAME="257"></A>have
compelled them to stay at home with them? Or, if the master would&nbsp;<A NAME="258"></A>not
stay, then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere,&nbsp;<A NAME="259"></A>until
they had got education enough?&nbsp;<A NAME="260"></A>

<P>Yes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.&nbsp;<A NAME="261"></A>
<BR>Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning&nbsp;<A NAME="262"></A>with
Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like,&nbsp;<A NAME="263"></A>but
the truth they never reach? The poet is like a painter who, as we have&nbsp;<A NAME="264"></A>already
observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands&nbsp;<A NAME="265"></A>nothing
of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for those who know&nbsp;<A NAME="266"></A>no
more than he does, and judge only by colours and&nbsp;<A NAME="267"></A>figures.&nbsp;<A NAME="268"></A>

<P>Quite so.&nbsp;<A NAME="269"></A>
<BR>In like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay&nbsp;<A NAME="270"></A>on
the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature&nbsp;<A NAME="271"></A>only
enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as he&nbsp;<A NAME="272"></A>is,
and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of cobbling,&nbsp;<A NAME="273"></A>or
of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and harmony and rhythm,&nbsp;<A NAME="274"></A>he
speaks very well --such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm&nbsp;<A NAME="275"></A>by
nature have. And I think that you must have observed again and again&nbsp;<A NAME="276"></A>what
a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours&nbsp;<A NAME="277"></A>which
music puts upon them, and recited in simple prose.&nbsp;<A NAME="278"></A>

<P>Yes, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="279"></A>
<BR>They are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only blooming;&nbsp;<A NAME="280"></A>and
now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?&nbsp;<A NAME="281"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="282"></A>
<BR>Here is another point: The imitator or maker of the image knows nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="283"></A>of
true existence; he knows appearances only. Am I not&nbsp;<A NAME="284"></A>right?&nbsp;<A NAME="285"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="286"></A>
<BR>Then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half&nbsp;<A NAME="287"></A>an
explanation.&nbsp;<A NAME="288"></A>

<P>Proceed.&nbsp;<A NAME="289"></A>
<BR>Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a&nbsp;<A NAME="290"></A>bit?&nbsp;<A NAME="291"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="292"></A>
<BR>And the worker in leather and brass will make them?&nbsp;<A NAME="293"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="294"></A>
<BR>But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? Nay,&nbsp;<A NAME="295"></A>hardly
even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the horseman&nbsp;<A NAME="296"></A>who
knows how to use them --he knows their right form.&nbsp;<A NAME="297"></A>

<P>Most true.&nbsp;<A NAME="298"></A>
<BR>And may we not say the same of all things?&nbsp;<A NAME="299"></A>
<BR>What?&nbsp;<A NAME="300"></A>
<BR>That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one&nbsp;<A NAME="301"></A>which
uses, another which makes, a third which imitates&nbsp;<A NAME="302"></A>them?&nbsp;<A NAME="303"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="304"></A>
<BR>And the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or&nbsp;<A NAME="305"></A>inanimate,
and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which&nbsp;<A NAME="306"></A>nature
or the artist has intended them.&nbsp;<A NAME="307"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="308"></A>
<BR>Then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and&nbsp;<A NAME="309"></A>he
must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="310"></A>in
use; for example, the flute-player will tell the flute-maker which of&nbsp;<A NAME="311"></A>his
flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he will tell him how he ought&nbsp;<A NAME="312"></A>to
make them, and the other will attend to his instructions?&nbsp;<A NAME="313"></A>

<P>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="314"></A>
<BR>The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness&nbsp;<A NAME="315"></A>and
badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what&nbsp;<A NAME="316"></A>he
is told by him?&nbsp;<A NAME="317"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="318"></A>
<BR>The instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of&nbsp;<A NAME="319"></A>it
the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain&nbsp;<A NAME="320"></A>from
him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what&nbsp;<A NAME="321"></A>he
has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?&nbsp;<A NAME="322"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="323"></A>
<BR>But will the imitator have either? Will he know from use whether or&nbsp;<A NAME="324"></A>no
his drawing is correct or beautiful? Or will he have right opinion from&nbsp;<A NAME="325"></A>being
compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions&nbsp;<A NAME="326"></A>about
what he should draw?&nbsp;<A NAME="327"></A>

<P>Neither.&nbsp;<A NAME="328"></A>
<BR>Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="329"></A>about
the goodness or badness of his imitations?&nbsp;<A NAME="330"></A>

<P>I suppose not.&nbsp;<A NAME="331"></A>
<BR>The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about&nbsp;<A NAME="332"></A>his
own creations?&nbsp;<A NAME="333"></A>

<P>Nay, very much the reverse.&nbsp;<A NAME="334"></A>
<BR>And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing&nbsp;<A NAME="335"></A>good
or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears&nbsp;<A NAME="336"></A>to
be good to the ignorant multitude?&nbsp;<A NAME="337"></A>

<P>Just so.&nbsp;<A NAME="338"></A>
<BR>Thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="339"></A>worth
mentioning of what he imitates. Imitation is only a kind of play&nbsp;<A NAME="340"></A>or
sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in iambic or in Heroic&nbsp;<A NAME="341"></A>verse,
are imitators in the highest degree?&nbsp;<A NAME="342"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="343"></A>
<BR>And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us&nbsp;<A NAME="344"></A>to
be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the&nbsp;<A NAME="345"></A>truth?&nbsp;<A NAME="346"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="347"></A>
<BR>And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is&nbsp;<A NAME="348"></A>addressed?&nbsp;<A NAME="349"></A>
<BR>What do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="350"></A>
<BR>I will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small&nbsp;<A NAME="351"></A>when
seen at a distance?&nbsp;<A NAME="352"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="353"></A>
<BR>And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water,&nbsp;<A NAME="354"></A>and
crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to&nbsp;<A NAME="355"></A>the
illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort&nbsp;<A NAME="356"></A>of
confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human&nbsp;<A NAME="357"></A>mind
on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow&nbsp;<A NAME="358"></A>and
other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us like&nbsp;<A NAME="359"></A>magic.&nbsp;<A NAME="360"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="361"></A>
<BR>And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue&nbsp;<A NAME="362"></A>of
the human understanding-there is the beauty of them --and the apparent&nbsp;<A NAME="363"></A>greater
or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over us,&nbsp;<A NAME="364"></A>but
give way before calculation and measure and weight?&nbsp;<A NAME="365"></A>

<P>Most true.&nbsp;<A NAME="366"></A>
<BR>And this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational&nbsp;<A NAME="367"></A>principle
in the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="368"></A>

<P>To be sure.&nbsp;<A NAME="369"></A>
<BR>And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are&nbsp;<A NAME="370"></A>equal,
or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent&nbsp;<A NAME="371"></A>contradiction?&nbsp;<A NAME="372"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="373"></A>
<BR>But were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty&nbsp;<A NAME="374"></A>cannot
have contrary opinions at the same time about the same&nbsp;<A NAME="375"></A>thing?&nbsp;<A NAME="376"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="377"></A>
<BR>Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure&nbsp;<A NAME="378"></A>is
not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with&nbsp;<A NAME="379"></A>measure?&nbsp;<A NAME="380"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="381"></A>
<BR>And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to&nbsp;<A NAME="382"></A>measure
and calculation?&nbsp;<A NAME="383"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="384"></A>
<BR>And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles&nbsp;<A NAME="385"></A>of
the soul?&nbsp;<A NAME="386"></A>

<P>No doubt.&nbsp;<A NAME="387"></A>
<BR>This was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said&nbsp;<A NAME="388"></A>that
painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their own&nbsp;<A NAME="389"></A>proper
work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and friends&nbsp;<A NAME="390"></A>and
associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason,&nbsp;<A NAME="391"></A>and
that they have no true or healthy aim.&nbsp;<A NAME="392"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="393"></A>
<BR>The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has inferior&nbsp;<A NAME="394"></A>offspring.&nbsp;<A NAME="395"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="396"></A>
<BR>And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing&nbsp;<A NAME="397"></A>also,
relating in fact to what we term poetry?&nbsp;<A NAME="398"></A>

<P>Probably the same would be true of poetry.&nbsp;<A NAME="399"></A>
<BR>Do not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of painting;&nbsp;<A NAME="400"></A>but
let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical&nbsp;<A NAME="401"></A>imitation
is concerned is good or bad.&nbsp;<A NAME="402"></A>

<P>By all means.&nbsp;<A NAME="403"></A>
<BR>We may state the question thus: --Imitation imitates the actions of&nbsp;<A NAME="404"></A>men,
whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good&nbsp;<A NAME="405"></A>or
bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. Is there&nbsp;<A NAME="406"></A>anything
more?&nbsp;<A NAME="407"></A>

<P>No, there is nothing else.&nbsp;<A NAME="408"></A>
<BR>But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself&nbsp;<A NAME="409"></A>--or
rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition&nbsp;<A NAME="410"></A>in
his opinions about the same things, so here also is there not strife&nbsp;<A NAME="411"></A>and
inconsistency in his life? Though I need hardly raise the question&nbsp;<A NAME="412"></A>again,
for I remember that all this has been already admitted; and the&nbsp;<A NAME="413"></A>soul
has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar&nbsp;<A NAME="414"></A>oppositions
occurring at the same moment?&nbsp;<A NAME="415"></A>

<P>And we were right, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="416"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission which&nbsp;<A NAME="417"></A>must
now be supplied.&nbsp;<A NAME="418"></A>

<P>What was the omission?&nbsp;<A NAME="419"></A>
<BR>Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose&nbsp;<A NAME="420"></A>his
son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss&nbsp;<A NAME="421"></A>with
more equanimity than another?&nbsp;<A NAME="422"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="423"></A>
<BR>But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot&nbsp;<A NAME="424"></A>help
sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?&nbsp;<A NAME="425"></A>

<P>The latter, he said, is the truer statement.&nbsp;<A NAME="426"></A>
<BR>Tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his&nbsp;<A NAME="427"></A>sorrow
when he is seen by his equals, or when he is&nbsp;<A NAME="428"></A>alone?&nbsp;<A NAME="429"></A>

<P>It will make a great difference whether he is seen or&nbsp;<A NAME="430"></A>not.&nbsp;<A NAME="431"></A>
<BR>When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things&nbsp;<A NAME="432"></A>which
he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him&nbsp;<A NAME="433"></A>do?&nbsp;<A NAME="434"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="435"></A>
<BR>There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist,&nbsp;<A NAME="436"></A>as
well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge&nbsp;<A NAME="437"></A>his
sorrow?&nbsp;<A NAME="438"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="439"></A>
<BR>But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the&nbsp;<A NAME="440"></A>same
object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles&nbsp;<A NAME="441"></A>in
him?&nbsp;<A NAME="442"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="443"></A>
<BR>One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the&nbsp;<A NAME="444"></A>law?&nbsp;<A NAME="445"></A>
<BR>How do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="446"></A>
<BR>The law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that&nbsp;<A NAME="447"></A>we
should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether such&nbsp;<A NAME="448"></A>things
are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience; also, because&nbsp;<A NAME="449"></A>no
human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands in the way of&nbsp;<A NAME="450"></A>that
which at the moment is most required.&nbsp;<A NAME="451"></A>

<P>What is most required? he asked.&nbsp;<A NAME="452"></A>
<BR>That we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice&nbsp;<A NAME="453"></A>have
been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best;&nbsp;<A NAME="454"></A>not,
like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck&nbsp;<A NAME="455"></A>and
wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="456"></A>forthwith
to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and fallen,&nbsp;<A NAME="457"></A>banishing
the cry of sorrow by the healing art.&nbsp;<A NAME="458"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of&nbsp;<A NAME="459"></A>fortune.&nbsp;<A NAME="460"></A>

<P>Yes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion&nbsp;<A NAME="461"></A>of
reason?&nbsp;<A NAME="462"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="463"></A>
<BR>And the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our troubles&nbsp;<A NAME="464"></A>and
to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may call irrational,&nbsp;<A NAME="465"></A>useless,
and cowardly?&nbsp;<A NAME="466"></A>

<P>Indeed, we may.&nbsp;<A NAME="467"></A>
<BR>And does not the latter --I mean the rebellious principle --furnish&nbsp;<A NAME="468"></A>a
great variety of materials for imitation? Whereas the wise and calm temperament,&nbsp;<A NAME="469"></A>being
always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when&nbsp;<A NAME="470"></A>imitated,
especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled&nbsp;<A NAME="471"></A>in
a theatre. For the feeling represented is one to which they are&nbsp;<A NAME="472"></A>strangers.&nbsp;<A NAME="473"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="474"></A>
<BR>Then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature&nbsp;<A NAME="475"></A>made,
nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the principle in&nbsp;<A NAME="476"></A>the
soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which is&nbsp;<A NAME="477"></A>easily
imitated?&nbsp;<A NAME="478"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="479"></A>
<BR>And now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter,&nbsp;<A NAME="480"></A>for
he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his creations have an&nbsp;<A NAME="481"></A>inferior
degree of truth --in this, I say, he is like him; and he is also&nbsp;<A NAME="482"></A>like
him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul; and therefore&nbsp;<A NAME="483"></A>we
shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well-ordered State, because&nbsp;<A NAME="484"></A>he
awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason.&nbsp;<A NAME="485"></A>As
in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good&nbsp;<A NAME="486"></A>are
put out of the way, so in the soul of man, as we maintain, the imitative&nbsp;<A NAME="487"></A>poet
implants an evil constitution, for he indulges the irrational nature&nbsp;<A NAME="488"></A>which
has no discernment of greater and less, but thinks the same thing&nbsp;<A NAME="489"></A>at
one time great and at another small-he is a manufacturer of images and&nbsp;<A NAME="490"></A>is
very far removed from the truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="491"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="492"></A>
<BR>But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation:&nbsp;<A NAME="493"></A>--the
power which poetry has of harming even the good (and there are very&nbsp;<A NAME="494"></A>few
who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?&nbsp;<A NAME="495"></A>

<P>Yes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.&nbsp;<A NAME="496"></A>
<BR>Hear and judge: The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a&nbsp;<A NAME="497"></A>passage
of Homer, or one of the tragedians, in which he represents some&nbsp;<A NAME="498"></A>pitiful
hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration, or weeping,&nbsp;<A NAME="499"></A>and
smiting his breast --the best of us, you know, delight in giving way&nbsp;<A NAME="500"></A>to
sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs&nbsp;<A NAME="501"></A>our
feelings most.&nbsp;<A NAME="502"></A>

<P>Yes, of course I know.&nbsp;<A NAME="503"></A>
<BR>But when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe&nbsp;<A NAME="504"></A>that
we pride ourselves on the opposite quality --we would fain be quiet&nbsp;<A NAME="505"></A>and
patient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted us in&nbsp;<A NAME="506"></A>the
recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.&nbsp;<A NAME="507"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="508"></A>
<BR>Now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that&nbsp;<A NAME="509"></A>which
any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own&nbsp;<A NAME="510"></A>person?&nbsp;<A NAME="511"></A>

<P>No, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.&nbsp;<A NAME="512"></A>
<BR>Nay, I said, quite reasonable from one point of&nbsp;<A NAME="513"></A>view.&nbsp;<A NAME="514"></A>
<BR>What point of view?&nbsp;<A NAME="515"></A>
<BR>If you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural&nbsp;<A NAME="516"></A>hunger
and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and&nbsp;<A NAME="517"></A>that
this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is&nbsp;<A NAME="518"></A>satisfied
and delighted by the poets;-the better nature in each of us,&nbsp;<A NAME="519"></A>not
having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the sympathetic&nbsp;<A NAME="520"></A>element
to break loose because the sorrow is another's; and the spectator&nbsp;<A NAME="521"></A>fancies
that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying&nbsp;<A NAME="522"></A>any
one who comes telling him what a good man he is, and making a fuss&nbsp;<A NAME="523"></A>about
his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure is a gain, and why should&nbsp;<A NAME="524"></A>he
be supercilious and lose this and the poem too? Few persons ever reflect,&nbsp;<A NAME="525"></A>as
I should imagine, that from the evil of other men something of evil&nbsp;<A NAME="526"></A>is
communicated to themselves. And so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered&nbsp;<A NAME="527"></A>strength
at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed&nbsp;<A NAME="528"></A>in
our own.&nbsp;<A NAME="529"></A>

<P>How very true!&nbsp;<A NAME="530"></A>
<BR>And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests&nbsp;<A NAME="531"></A>which
you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage,&nbsp;<A NAME="532"></A>or
indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them,&nbsp;<A NAME="533"></A>and
are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness; --the case of pity&nbsp;<A NAME="534"></A>is
repeated; --there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to&nbsp;<A NAME="535"></A>raise
a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you&nbsp;<A NAME="536"></A>were
afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having&nbsp;<A NAME="537"></A>stimulated
the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously&nbsp;<A NAME="538"></A>to
yourself into playing the comic poet at home.&nbsp;<A NAME="539"></A>

<P>Quite true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="540"></A>
<BR>And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections,&nbsp;<A NAME="541"></A>of
desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from&nbsp;<A NAME="542"></A>every
action ---in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead&nbsp;<A NAME="543"></A>of
drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled,&nbsp;<A NAME="544"></A>if
mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue.&nbsp;<A NAME="545"></A>

<P>I cannot deny it.&nbsp;<A NAME="546"></A>
<BR>Therefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists&nbsp;<A NAME="547"></A>of
Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas, and that he&nbsp;<A NAME="548"></A>is
profitable for education and for the ordering of human things, and that&nbsp;<A NAME="549"></A>you
should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate&nbsp;<A NAME="550"></A>your
whole life according to him, we may love and honour those who say&nbsp;<A NAME="551"></A>these
things --they are excellent people, as far as their lights extend;&nbsp;<A NAME="552"></A>and
we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest of poets and&nbsp;<A NAME="553"></A>first
of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our conviction that&nbsp;<A NAME="554"></A>hymns
to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought&nbsp;<A NAME="555"></A>to
be admitted into our State. For if you go beyond this and allow the&nbsp;<A NAME="556"></A>honeyed
muse to enter, either in epic or lyric verse, not law and the reason&nbsp;<A NAME="557"></A>of
mankind, which by common consent have ever been deemed best, but pleasure&nbsp;<A NAME="558"></A>and
pain will be the rulers in our State.&nbsp;<A NAME="559"></A>

<P>That is most true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="560"></A>
<BR>And now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our&nbsp;<A NAME="561"></A>defence
serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending&nbsp;<A NAME="562"></A>away
out of our State an art having the tendencies which we have described;&nbsp;<A NAME="563"></A>for
reason constrained us. But that she may impute to us any harshness&nbsp;<A NAME="564"></A>or
want of politeness, let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel&nbsp;<A NAME="565"></A>between
philosophy and poetry; of which there are many proofs, such as&nbsp;<A NAME="566"></A>the
saying of 'the yelping hound howling at her lord,' or of one 'mighty&nbsp;<A NAME="567"></A>in
the vain talk of fools,' and 'the mob of sages circumventing Zeus,'&nbsp;<A NAME="568"></A>and
the 'subtle thinkers who are beggars after all'; and there are innumerable&nbsp;<A NAME="569"></A>other
signs of ancient enmity between them. Notwithstanding this, let us&nbsp;<A NAME="570"></A>assure
our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will&nbsp;<A NAME="571"></A>only
prove her title to exist in a well-ordered State we shall be delighted&nbsp;<A NAME="572"></A>to
receive her --we are very conscious of her charms; but we may not on&nbsp;<A NAME="573"></A>that
account betray the truth. I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much&nbsp;<A NAME="574"></A>charmed
by her as I am, especially when she appears in&nbsp;<A NAME="575"></A>Homer?&nbsp;<A NAME="576"></A>

<P>Yes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.&nbsp;<A NAME="577"></A>
<BR>Shall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but&nbsp;<A NAME="578"></A>upon
this condition only --that she make a defence of herself in lyrical&nbsp;<A NAME="579"></A>or
some other metre?&nbsp;<A NAME="580"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="581"></A>
<BR>And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of&nbsp;<A NAME="582"></A>poetry
and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf:&nbsp;<A NAME="583"></A>let
them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and&nbsp;<A NAME="584"></A>to
human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if this can be&nbsp;<A NAME="585"></A>proved
we shall surely be the gainers --I mean, if there is a use in poetry&nbsp;<A NAME="586"></A>as
well as a delight?&nbsp;<A NAME="587"></A>

<P>Certainly, he said, we shall the gainers.&nbsp;<A NAME="588"></A>
<BR>If her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who&nbsp;<A NAME="589"></A>are
enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they&nbsp;<A NAME="590"></A>think
their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we after&nbsp;<A NAME="591"></A>the
manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle. We too&nbsp;<A NAME="592"></A>are
inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble States&nbsp;<A NAME="593"></A>has
implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at her best&nbsp;<A NAME="594"></A>and
truest; but so long as she is unable to make good her defence, this&nbsp;<A NAME="595"></A>argument
of ours shall be a charm to us, which we will repeat to ourselves&nbsp;<A NAME="596"></A>while
we listen to her strains; that we may not fall away into the childish&nbsp;<A NAME="597"></A>love
of her which captivates the many. At all events we are well aware&nbsp;<A NAME="598"></A>that
poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously&nbsp;<A NAME="599"></A>as
attaining to the truth; and he who listens to her, fearing for the safety&nbsp;<A NAME="600"></A>of
the city which is within him, should be on his guard against her seductions&nbsp;<A NAME="601"></A>and
make our words his law.&nbsp;<A NAME="602"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, I quite agree with you.&nbsp;<A NAME="603"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater&nbsp;<A NAME="604"></A>than
appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. And what will any one&nbsp;<A NAME="605"></A>be
profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or&nbsp;<A NAME="606"></A>under
the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and&nbsp;<A NAME="607"></A>virtue?&nbsp;<A NAME="608"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe&nbsp;<A NAME="609"></A>that
any one else would have been.&nbsp;<A NAME="610"></A>

<P>And yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards&nbsp;<A NAME="611"></A>which
await virtue.&nbsp;<A NAME="612"></A>

<P>What, are there any greater still? If there are, they must be of&nbsp;<A NAME="613"></A>an
inconceivable greatness.&nbsp;<A NAME="614"></A>

<P>Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time? The whole period&nbsp;<A NAME="615"></A>of
threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison&nbsp;<A NAME="616"></A>with
eternity?&nbsp;<A NAME="617"></A>

<P>Say rather 'nothing,' he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="618"></A>
<BR>And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather&nbsp;<A NAME="619"></A>than
of the whole?&nbsp;<A NAME="620"></A>

<P>Of the whole, certainly. But why do you ask?&nbsp;<A NAME="621"></A>
<BR>Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and&nbsp;<A NAME="622"></A>imperishable?&nbsp;<A NAME="623"></A>

<P>He looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are&nbsp;<A NAME="624"></A>you
really prepared to maintain this?&nbsp;<A NAME="625"></A>

<P>Yes, I said, I ought to be, and you too --there is no difficulty&nbsp;<A NAME="626"></A>in
proving it.&nbsp;<A NAME="627"></A>

<P>I see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this&nbsp;<A NAME="628"></A>argument
of which you make so light.&nbsp;<A NAME="629"></A>

<P>Listen then.&nbsp;<A NAME="630"></A>
<BR>I am attending.&nbsp;<A NAME="631"></A>
<BR>There is a thing which you call good and another which you call&nbsp;<A NAME="632"></A>evil?&nbsp;<A NAME="633"></A>

<P>Yes, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="634"></A>
<BR>Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying&nbsp;<A NAME="635"></A>element
is the evil, and the saving and improving element the&nbsp;<A NAME="636"></A>good?&nbsp;<A NAME="637"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="638"></A>
<BR>And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as ophthalmia&nbsp;<A NAME="639"></A>is
the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as mildew is of&nbsp;<A NAME="640"></A>corn,
and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in everything, or&nbsp;<A NAME="641"></A>in
almost everything, there is an inherent evil and&nbsp;<A NAME="642"></A>disease?&nbsp;<A NAME="643"></A>

<P>Yes, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="644"></A>
<BR>And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil,&nbsp;<A NAME="645"></A>and
at last wholly dissolves and dies?&nbsp;<A NAME="646"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="647"></A>
<BR>The vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each;&nbsp;<A NAME="648"></A>and
if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will; for&nbsp;<A NAME="649"></A>good
certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is neither&nbsp;<A NAME="650"></A>good
nor evil.&nbsp;<A NAME="651"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="652"></A>
<BR>If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption&nbsp;<A NAME="653"></A>cannot
be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a nature&nbsp;<A NAME="654"></A>there
is no destruction?&nbsp;<A NAME="655"></A>

<P>That may be assumed.&nbsp;<A NAME="656"></A>
<BR>Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the&nbsp;<A NAME="657"></A>soul?&nbsp;<A NAME="658"></A>
<BR>Yes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing&nbsp;<A NAME="659"></A>in
review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice,&nbsp;<A NAME="660"></A>ignorance.&nbsp;<A NAME="661"></A>

<P>But does any of these dissolve or destroy her? --and here do not&nbsp;<A NAME="662"></A>let
us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man,&nbsp;<A NAME="663"></A>when
he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil&nbsp;<A NAME="664"></A>of
the soul. Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a disease&nbsp;<A NAME="665"></A>which
wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the things of&nbsp;<A NAME="666"></A>which
we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own&nbsp;<A NAME="667"></A>corruption
attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them.&nbsp;<A NAME="668"></A>Is
not this true?&nbsp;<A NAME="669"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="670"></A>
<BR>Consider the soul in like manner. Does the injustice or other evil&nbsp;<A NAME="671"></A>which
exists in the soul waste and consume her? Do they by attaching to&nbsp;<A NAME="672"></A>the
soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate&nbsp;<A NAME="673"></A>her
from the body ?&nbsp;<A NAME="674"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="675"></A>
<BR>And yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish&nbsp;<A NAME="676"></A>from
without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed&nbsp;<A NAME="677"></A>from
within by a corruption of its own?&nbsp;<A NAME="678"></A>

<P>It is, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="679"></A>
<BR>Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether staleness,&nbsp;<A NAME="680"></A>decomposition,
or any other bad quality, when confined to the actual food,&nbsp;<A NAME="681"></A>is
not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the badness of food communicates&nbsp;<A NAME="682"></A>corruption
to the body, then we should say that the body has been destroyed&nbsp;<A NAME="683"></A>by
a corruption of itself, which is disease, brought on by this; but that&nbsp;<A NAME="684"></A>the
body, being one thing, can be destroyed by the badness of food, which&nbsp;<A NAME="685"></A>is
another, and which does not engender any natural infection --this we&nbsp;<A NAME="686"></A>shall
absolutely deny?&nbsp;<A NAME="687"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="688"></A>
<BR>And, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an&nbsp;<A NAME="689"></A>evil
of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing,&nbsp;<A NAME="690"></A>can
be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to&nbsp;<A NAME="691"></A>another?&nbsp;<A NAME="692"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, there is reason in that.&nbsp;<A NAME="693"></A>
<BR>Either then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains unrefuted,&nbsp;<A NAME="694"></A>let
us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the knife put to&nbsp;<A NAME="695"></A>the
throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest&nbsp;<A NAME="696"></A>pieces,
can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved to become more&nbsp;<A NAME="697"></A>unholy
or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the&nbsp;<A NAME="698"></A>body;
but that the soul, or anything else if not destroyed by an internal&nbsp;<A NAME="699"></A>evil,
can be destroyed by an external one, is not to. be affirmed by any&nbsp;<A NAME="700"></A>man.&nbsp;<A NAME="701"></A>

<P>And surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of&nbsp;<A NAME="702"></A>men
become more unjust in consequence of death.&nbsp;<A NAME="703"></A>

<P>But if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the&nbsp;<A NAME="704"></A>soul
boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more&nbsp;<A NAME="705"></A>evil
and unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that injustice,&nbsp;<A NAME="706"></A>like
disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and that those&nbsp;<A NAME="707"></A>who
take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction&nbsp;<A NAME="708"></A>which
evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but in quite another&nbsp;<A NAME="709"></A>way
from that in which, at present, the wicked receive death at the hands&nbsp;<A NAME="710"></A>of
others as the penalty of their deeds?&nbsp;<A NAME="711"></A>

<P>Nay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will&nbsp;<A NAME="712"></A>not
be so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil. But&nbsp;<A NAME="713"></A>I
rather suspect the opposite to be the truth, and that injustice which,&nbsp;<A NAME="714"></A>if
it have the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer alive --aye,&nbsp;<A NAME="715"></A>and
well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place from being a house&nbsp;<A NAME="716"></A>of
death.&nbsp;<A NAME="717"></A>

<P>True, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="718"></A>is
unable to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to&nbsp;<A NAME="719"></A>be
the destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else&nbsp;<A NAME="720"></A>except
that of which it was appointed to be the destruction.&nbsp;<A NAME="721"></A>

<P>Yes, that can hardly be.&nbsp;<A NAME="722"></A>
<BR>But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent&nbsp;<A NAME="723"></A>or
external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be&nbsp;<A NAME="724"></A>immortal?&nbsp;<A NAME="725"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="726"></A>
<BR>That is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then the&nbsp;<A NAME="727"></A>souls
must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish&nbsp;<A NAME="728"></A>in
number. Neither will they increase, for the increase of the immortal&nbsp;<A NAME="729"></A>natures
must come from something mortal, and all things would thus end&nbsp;<A NAME="730"></A>in
immortality.&nbsp;<A NAME="731"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="732"></A>
<BR>But this we cannot believe --reason will not allow us --any more than&nbsp;<A NAME="733"></A>we
can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and&nbsp;<A NAME="734"></A>difference
and dissimilarity.&nbsp;<A NAME="735"></A>

<P>What do you mean? he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="736"></A>
<BR>The soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest&nbsp;<A NAME="737"></A>of
compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?&nbsp;<A NAME="738"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="739"></A>
<BR>Her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there&nbsp;<A NAME="740"></A>are
many other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we now behold&nbsp;<A NAME="741"></A>her,
marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you must contemplate&nbsp;<A NAME="742"></A>her
with the eye of reason, in her original purity; and then her beauty&nbsp;<A NAME="743"></A>will
be revealed, and justice and injustice and all the things which we&nbsp;<A NAME="744"></A>have
described will be manifested more clearly. Thus far, we have spoken&nbsp;<A NAME="745"></A>the
truth concerning her as she appears at present, but we must remember&nbsp;<A NAME="746"></A>also
that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to&nbsp;<A NAME="747"></A>that
of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original image can hardly be discerned&nbsp;<A NAME="748"></A>because
his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the&nbsp;<A NAME="749"></A>waves
in all sorts of ways, and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed&nbsp;<A NAME="750"></A>and
shells and stones, so that he is more like some monster than he is&nbsp;<A NAME="751"></A>to
his own natural form. And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition,&nbsp;<A NAME="752"></A>disfigured
by ten thousand ills. But not there, Glaucon, not there must&nbsp;<A NAME="753"></A>we
look.&nbsp;<A NAME="754"></A>

<P>Where then?&nbsp;<A NAME="755"></A>
<BR>At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what society&nbsp;<A NAME="756"></A>and
converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal&nbsp;<A NAME="757"></A>and
eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly following&nbsp;<A NAME="758"></A>this
superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean&nbsp;<A NAME="759"></A>in
which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and shells and things&nbsp;<A NAME="760"></A>of
earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she&nbsp;<A NAME="761"></A>feeds
upon earth, and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they&nbsp;<A NAME="762"></A>are
termed: then you would see her as she is, and know whether she has&nbsp;<A NAME="763"></A>one
shape only or many, or what her nature is. Of her affections and of&nbsp;<A NAME="764"></A>the
forms which she takes in this present life I think that we have now&nbsp;<A NAME="765"></A>said
enough.&nbsp;<A NAME="766"></A>

<P>True, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="767"></A>
<BR>And thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument;&nbsp;<A NAME="768"></A>we
have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you&nbsp;<A NAME="769"></A>were
saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice in her own&nbsp;<A NAME="770"></A>nature
has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature. Let a&nbsp;<A NAME="771"></A>man
do what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges or not, and even&nbsp;<A NAME="772"></A>if
in addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the helmet of&nbsp;<A NAME="773"></A>Hades.&nbsp;<A NAME="774"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="775"></A>
<BR>And now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how&nbsp;<A NAME="776"></A>many
and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues&nbsp;<A NAME="777"></A>procure
to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after&nbsp;<A NAME="778"></A>death.&nbsp;<A NAME="779"></A>

<P>Certainly not, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="780"></A>
<BR>Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the&nbsp;<A NAME="781"></A>argument?&nbsp;<A NAME="782"></A>
<BR>What did I borrow?&nbsp;<A NAME="783"></A>
<BR>The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="784"></A>just:
for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could&nbsp;<A NAME="785"></A>not
possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission ought&nbsp;<A NAME="786"></A>to
be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure justice might&nbsp;<A NAME="787"></A>be
weighed against pure injustice. Do you remember?&nbsp;<A NAME="788"></A>

<P>I should be much to blame if I had forgotten.&nbsp;<A NAME="789"></A>
<BR>Then, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that the&nbsp;<A NAME="790"></A>estimation
in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="791"></A>to
be her due should now be restored to her by us; since she has been shown&nbsp;<A NAME="792"></A>to
confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly possess her, let&nbsp;<A NAME="793"></A>what
has been taken from her be given back, that so she may win that palm&nbsp;<A NAME="794"></A>of
appearance which is hers also, and which she gives to her&nbsp;<A NAME="795"></A>own.&nbsp;<A NAME="796"></A>

<P>The demand, he said, is just.&nbsp;<A NAME="797"></A>
<BR>In the first place, I said --and this is the first thing which you&nbsp;<A NAME="798"></A>will
have to give back --the nature both of the just and unjust is truly&nbsp;<A NAME="799"></A>known
to the gods.&nbsp;<A NAME="800"></A>

<P>Granted.&nbsp;<A NAME="801"></A>
<BR>And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the&nbsp;<A NAME="802"></A>other
the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the&nbsp;<A NAME="803"></A>beginning?&nbsp;<A NAME="804"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="805"></A>
<BR>And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all&nbsp;<A NAME="806"></A>things
at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence&nbsp;<A NAME="807"></A>of
former sins?&nbsp;<A NAME="808"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="809"></A>
<BR>Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is&nbsp;<A NAME="810"></A>in
poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will&nbsp;<A NAME="811"></A>in
the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="812"></A>have
a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God,&nbsp;<A NAME="813"></A>as
far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of&nbsp;<A NAME="814"></A>virtue?&nbsp;<A NAME="815"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected&nbsp;<A NAME="816"></A>by
him.&nbsp;<A NAME="817"></A>

<P>And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?&nbsp;<A NAME="818"></A>
<BR>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="819"></A>
<BR>Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the&nbsp;<A NAME="820"></A>just?&nbsp;<A NAME="821"></A>
<BR>That is my conviction.&nbsp;<A NAME="822"></A>
<BR>And what do they receive of men? Look at things as they really are,&nbsp;<A NAME="823"></A>and
you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who&nbsp;<A NAME="824"></A>run
well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the&nbsp;<A NAME="825"></A>goal:
they go off at a great pace, but in the end only look foolish, slinking&nbsp;<A NAME="826"></A>away
with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without a crown;&nbsp;<A NAME="827"></A>but
the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned.&nbsp;<A NAME="828"></A>And
this is the way with the just; he who endures to the end of every action&nbsp;<A NAME="829"></A>and
occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize&nbsp;<A NAME="830"></A>which
men have to bestow.&nbsp;<A NAME="831"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="832"></A>
<BR>And now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which&nbsp;<A NAME="833"></A>you
were attributing to the fortunate unjust. I shall say of them, what&nbsp;<A NAME="834"></A>you
were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become rulers&nbsp;<A NAME="835"></A>in
their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like and give&nbsp;<A NAME="836"></A>in
marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others I now say&nbsp;<A NAME="837"></A>of
these. And, on the other hand, of the unjust I say that the greater&nbsp;<A NAME="838"></A>number,
even though they escape in their youth, are found out at last and&nbsp;<A NAME="839"></A>look
foolish at the end of their course, and when they come to be old and&nbsp;<A NAME="840"></A>miserable
are flouted alike by stranger and citizen; they are beaten and&nbsp;<A NAME="841"></A>then
come those things unfit for ears polite, as you truly term them; they&nbsp;<A NAME="842"></A>will
be racked and have their eyes burned out, as you were saying. And&nbsp;<A NAME="843"></A>you
may suppose that I have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors.&nbsp;<A NAME="844"></A>But
will you let me assume, without reciting them, that these things are&nbsp;<A NAME="845"></A>true?&nbsp;<A NAME="846"></A>

<P>Certainly, he said, what you say is true.&nbsp;<A NAME="847"></A>
<BR>These, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed&nbsp;<A NAME="848"></A>upon
the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to the&nbsp;<A NAME="849"></A>other
good things which justice of herself provides.&nbsp;<A NAME="850"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.&nbsp;<A NAME="851"></A>
<BR>And yet, I said, all these are as nothing, either in number or greatness&nbsp;<A NAME="852"></A>in
comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="853"></A>after
death. And you ought to hear them, and then both just and unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="854"></A>will
have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument&nbsp;<A NAME="855"></A>owes
to them.&nbsp;<A NAME="856"></A>

<P>Speak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly&nbsp;<A NAME="857"></A>hear.&nbsp;<A NAME="858"></A>

<P>Socrates&nbsp;<A NAME="859"></A>

<P>Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which&nbsp;<A NAME="860"></A>Odysseus
tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero,&nbsp;<A NAME="861"></A>Er
the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle,&nbsp;<A NAME="862"></A>and
ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up already&nbsp;<A NAME="863"></A>in
a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by decay, and carried&nbsp;<A NAME="864"></A>away
home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as he was lying on the&nbsp;<A NAME="865"></A>funeral
pile, he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the&nbsp;<A NAME="866"></A>other
world. He said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey&nbsp;<A NAME="867"></A>with
a great company, and that they came to a mysterious place at which&nbsp;<A NAME="868"></A>there
were two openings in the earth; they were near together, and over&nbsp;<A NAME="869"></A>against
them were two other openings in the heaven above. In the intermediate&nbsp;<A NAME="870"></A>space
there were judges seated, who commanded the just, after they had&nbsp;<A NAME="871"></A>given
judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them,&nbsp;<A NAME="872"></A>to
ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand; and in like manner the&nbsp;<A NAME="873"></A>unjust
were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand;&nbsp;<A NAME="874"></A>these
also bore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs.&nbsp;<A NAME="875"></A>He
drew near, and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would&nbsp;<A NAME="876"></A>carry
the report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and&nbsp;<A NAME="877"></A>see
all that was to be heard and seen in that place. Then he beheld and&nbsp;<A NAME="878"></A>saw
on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth&nbsp;<A NAME="879"></A>when
sentence had been given on them; and at the two other openings other&nbsp;<A NAME="880"></A>souls,
some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel, some&nbsp;<A NAME="881"></A>descending
out of heaven clean and bright. And arriving ever and anon they&nbsp;<A NAME="882"></A>seemed
to have come from a long journey, and they went forth with gladness&nbsp;<A NAME="883"></A>into
the meadow, where they encamped as at a festival; and those who knew&nbsp;<A NAME="884"></A>one
another embraced and conversed, the souls which came from earth curiously&nbsp;<A NAME="885"></A>enquiring
about the things above, and the souls which came from heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="886"></A>about
the things beneath. And they told one another of what had happened&nbsp;<A NAME="887"></A>by
the way, those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of&nbsp;<A NAME="888"></A>the
things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the&nbsp;<A NAME="889"></A>earth
(now the journey lasted a thousand years), while those from above&nbsp;<A NAME="890"></A>were
describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty.&nbsp;<A NAME="891"></A>The
Story, Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this:&nbsp;<A NAME="892"></A>--He
said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered&nbsp;<A NAME="893"></A>tenfold;
or once in a hundred years --such being reckoned to be the length&nbsp;<A NAME="894"></A>of
man's life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand&nbsp;<A NAME="895"></A>years.
If, for example, there were any who had been the cause of many deaths,&nbsp;<A NAME="896"></A>or
had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been guilty of any other&nbsp;<A NAME="897"></A>evil
behaviour, for each and all of their offences they received punishment&nbsp;<A NAME="898"></A>ten
times over, and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness&nbsp;<A NAME="899"></A>were
in the same proportion. I need hardly repeat what he said concerning&nbsp;<A NAME="900"></A>young
children dying almost as soon as they were born. Of piety and impiety&nbsp;<A NAME="901"></A>to
gods and parents, and of murderers, there were retributions other and&nbsp;<A NAME="902"></A>greater
far which he described. He mentioned that he was present when one&nbsp;<A NAME="903"></A>of
the spirits asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?' (Now this&nbsp;<A NAME="904"></A>Ardiaeus
lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the&nbsp;<A NAME="905"></A>tyrant
of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and&nbsp;<A NAME="906"></A>his
elder brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable&nbsp;<A NAME="907"></A>crimes.)
The answer of the other spirit was: 'He comes not hither and will&nbsp;<A NAME="908"></A>never
come. And this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful sights which we&nbsp;<A NAME="909"></A>ourselves
witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having completed&nbsp;<A NAME="910"></A>all
our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden Ardiaeus&nbsp;<A NAME="911"></A>appeared
and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and there were&nbsp;<A NAME="912"></A>also
besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals:&nbsp;<A NAME="913"></A>they
were just, as they fancied, about to return into the upper world,&nbsp;<A NAME="914"></A>but
the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar, whenever any of&nbsp;<A NAME="915"></A>these
incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished&nbsp;<A NAME="916"></A>tried
to ascend; and then wild men of fiery aspect, who were standing by&nbsp;<A NAME="917"></A>and
heard the sound, seized and carried them off; and Ardiaeus and others&nbsp;<A NAME="918"></A>they
bound head and foot and hand, and threw them down and flayed them&nbsp;<A NAME="919"></A>with
scourges, and dragged them along the road at the side, carding them&nbsp;<A NAME="920"></A>on
thorns like wool, and declaring to the passers-by what were their crimes,&nbsp;<A NAME="921"></A>and
that they were being taken away to be cast into hell.' And of all the&nbsp;<A NAME="922"></A>many
terrors which they had endured, he said that there was none like the&nbsp;<A NAME="923"></A>terror
which each of them felt at that moment, lest they should hear the&nbsp;<A NAME="924"></A>voice;
and when there was silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding&nbsp;<A NAME="925"></A>joy.
These, said Er, were the penalties and retributions, and there were&nbsp;<A NAME="926"></A>blessings
as great.&nbsp;<A NAME="927"></A>

<P>Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven&nbsp;<A NAME="928"></A>days,
on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and,&nbsp;<A NAME="929"></A>on
the fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could&nbsp;<A NAME="930"></A>see
from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right through&nbsp;<A NAME="931"></A>the
whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the rainbow,&nbsp;<A NAME="932"></A>only
brighter and purer; another day's journey brought them to the place,&nbsp;<A NAME="933"></A>and
there, in the midst of the light, they saw the ends of the chains of&nbsp;<A NAME="934"></A>heaven
let down from above: for this light is the belt of heaven, and holds&nbsp;<A NAME="935"></A>together
the circle of the universe, like the under-girders of a trireme.&nbsp;<A NAME="936"></A>From
these ends is extended the spindle of Necessity, on which all the&nbsp;<A NAME="937"></A>revolutions
turn. The shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel,&nbsp;<A NAME="938"></A>and
the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials.&nbsp;<A NAME="939"></A>Now
the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth; and the description&nbsp;<A NAME="940"></A>of
it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped&nbsp;<A NAME="941"></A>out,
and into this is fitted another lesser one, and another, and another,&nbsp;<A NAME="942"></A>and
four others, making eight in all, like vessels which fit into one another;&nbsp;<A NAME="943"></A>the
whorls show their edges on the upper side, and on their lower side&nbsp;<A NAME="944"></A>all
together form one continuous whorl. This is pierced by the spindle,&nbsp;<A NAME="945"></A>which
is driven home through the centre of the eighth. The first and outermost&nbsp;<A NAME="946"></A>whorl
has the rim broadest, and the seven inner whorls are narrower, in&nbsp;<A NAME="947"></A>the
following proportions --the sixth is next to the first in size, the&nbsp;<A NAME="948"></A>fourth
next to the sixth; then comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth,&nbsp;<A NAME="949"></A>the
fifth is sixth, the third is seventh, last and eighth comes the second.&nbsp;<A NAME="950"></A>The
largest (of fixed stars) is spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is brightest;&nbsp;<A NAME="951"></A>the
eighth (or moon) coloured by the reflected light of the seventh; the&nbsp;<A NAME="952"></A>second
and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) are in colour like one another, and&nbsp;<A NAME="953"></A>yellower
than the preceding; the third (Venus) has the whitest light; the&nbsp;<A NAME="954"></A>fourth
(Mars) is reddish; the sixth (Jupiter) is in whiteness second. Now&nbsp;<A NAME="955"></A>the
whole spindle has the same motion; but, as the whole revolves in one&nbsp;<A NAME="956"></A>direction,
the seven inner circles move slowly in the other, and of these&nbsp;<A NAME="957"></A>the
swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness are the seventh, sixth, and&nbsp;<A NAME="958"></A>fifth,
which move together; third in swiftness appeared to move according&nbsp;<A NAME="959"></A>to
the law of this reversed motion the fourth; the third appeared fourth&nbsp;<A NAME="960"></A>and
the second fifth. The spindle turns on the knees of Necessity; and&nbsp;<A NAME="961"></A>on
the upper surface of each circle is a siren, who goes round with them,&nbsp;<A NAME="962"></A>hymning
a single tone or note. The eight together form one harmony; and&nbsp;<A NAME="963"></A>round
about, at equal intervals, there is another band, three in number,&nbsp;<A NAME="964"></A>each
sitting upon her throne: these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity,&nbsp;<A NAME="965"></A>who
are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis&nbsp;<A NAME="966"></A>and
Clotho and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of&nbsp;<A NAME="967"></A>the
sirens --Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos&nbsp;<A NAME="968"></A>of
the future; Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right&nbsp;<A NAME="969"></A>hand
the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and Atropos&nbsp;<A NAME="970"></A>with
her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones, and Lachesis laying&nbsp;<A NAME="971"></A>hold
of either in turn, first with one hand and then with the&nbsp;<A NAME="972"></A>other.&nbsp;<A NAME="973"></A>

<P>When Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to&nbsp;<A NAME="974"></A>Lachesis;
but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order;&nbsp;<A NAME="975"></A>then
he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of lives, and&nbsp;<A NAME="976"></A>having
mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'Hear the word of Lachesis,&nbsp;<A NAME="977"></A>the
daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new cycle of life and&nbsp;<A NAME="978"></A>mortality.
Your genius will not be allotted to you, but you choose your&nbsp;<A NAME="979"></A>genius;
and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice, and&nbsp;<A NAME="980"></A>the
life which he chooses shall be his destiny. Virtue is free, and as&nbsp;<A NAME="981"></A>a
man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her; the responsibility&nbsp;<A NAME="982"></A>is
with the chooser --God is justified.' When the Interpreter had thus&nbsp;<A NAME="983"></A>spoken
he scattered lots indifferently among them all, and each of them&nbsp;<A NAME="984"></A>took
up the lot which fell near him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed),&nbsp;<A NAME="985"></A>and
each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained.&nbsp;<A NAME="986"></A>Then
the Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives;&nbsp;<A NAME="987"></A>and
there were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of&nbsp;<A NAME="988"></A>all
sorts. There were lives of every animal and of man in every condition.&nbsp;<A NAME="989"></A>And
there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant's life,&nbsp;<A NAME="990"></A>others
which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and&nbsp;<A NAME="991"></A>exile
and beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some who were famous&nbsp;<A NAME="992"></A>for
their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in&nbsp;<A NAME="993"></A>games,
or, again, for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors;&nbsp;<A NAME="994"></A>and
some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities. And&nbsp;<A NAME="995"></A>of
women likewise; there was not, however, any definite character them,&nbsp;<A NAME="996"></A>because
the soul, when choosing a new life, must of necessity become different.&nbsp;<A NAME="997"></A>But
there was every other quality, and the all mingled with one another,&nbsp;<A NAME="998"></A>and
also with elements of wealth and poverty, and disease and health; and&nbsp;<A NAME="999"></A>there
were mean states also. And here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme&nbsp;<A NAME="1000"></A>peril
of our human state; and therefore the utmost care should be taken.&nbsp;<A NAME="1001"></A>Let
each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow&nbsp;<A NAME="1002"></A>one
thing only, if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some&nbsp;<A NAME="1003"></A>one
who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil,&nbsp;<A NAME="1004"></A>and
so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity.&nbsp;<A NAME="1005"></A>He
should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned&nbsp;<A NAME="1006"></A>severally
and collectively upon virtue; he should know what the effect&nbsp;<A NAME="1007"></A>of
beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul,&nbsp;<A NAME="1008"></A>and
what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth,&nbsp;<A NAME="1009"></A>of
private and public station, of strength and weakness, of cleverness&nbsp;<A NAME="1010"></A>and
dullness, and of all the soul, and the operation of them when conjoined;&nbsp;<A NAME="1011"></A>he
will then look at the nature of the soul, and from the consideration&nbsp;<A NAME="1012"></A>of
all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better&nbsp;<A NAME="1013"></A>and
which is the worse; and so he will choose, giving the name of evil&nbsp;<A NAME="1014"></A>to
the life which will make his soul more unjust, and good to the life&nbsp;<A NAME="1015"></A>which
will make his soul more just; all else he will disregard. For we&nbsp;<A NAME="1016"></A>have
seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after&nbsp;<A NAME="1017"></A>death.
A man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith&nbsp;<A NAME="1018"></A>in
truth and right, that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of&nbsp;<A NAME="1019"></A>wealth
or the other allurements of evil, lest, coming upon tyrannies and&nbsp;<A NAME="1020"></A>similar
villainies, he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet&nbsp;<A NAME="1021"></A>worse
himself; but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes&nbsp;<A NAME="1022"></A>on
either side, as far as possible, not only in this life but in all that&nbsp;<A NAME="1023"></A>which
is to come. For this is the way of happiness.&nbsp;<A NAME="1024"></A>

<P>And according to the report of the messenger from the other world&nbsp;<A NAME="1025"></A>this
was what the prophet said at the time: 'Even for the last comer, if&nbsp;<A NAME="1026"></A>he
chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy&nbsp;<A NAME="1027"></A>and
not undesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first be careless,&nbsp;<A NAME="1028"></A>and
let not the last despair.' And when he had spoken, he who had the first&nbsp;<A NAME="1029"></A>choice
came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny; his mind&nbsp;<A NAME="1030"></A>having
been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not thought out the&nbsp;<A NAME="1031"></A>whole
matter before he chose, and did not at first sight perceive that&nbsp;<A NAME="1032"></A>he
was fated, among other evils, to devour his own children. But when he&nbsp;<A NAME="1033"></A>had
time to reflect, and saw what was in the lot, he began to beat his&nbsp;<A NAME="1034"></A>breast
and lament over his choice, forgetting the proclamation of the prophet;&nbsp;<A NAME="1035"></A>for,
instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself, he accused&nbsp;<A NAME="1036"></A>chance
and the gods, and everything rather than himself. Now he was one&nbsp;<A NAME="1037"></A>of
those who came from heaven, and in a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered&nbsp;<A NAME="1038"></A>State,
but his virtue was a matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy.&nbsp;<A NAME="1039"></A>And
it was true of others who were similarly overtaken, that the greater&nbsp;<A NAME="1040"></A>number
of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled&nbsp;<A NAME="1041"></A>by
trial, whereas the pilgrims who came from earth, having themselves suffered&nbsp;<A NAME="1042"></A>and
seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to choose. And owing to this&nbsp;<A NAME="1043"></A>inexperience
of theirs, and also because the lot was a chance, many of&nbsp;<A NAME="1044"></A>the
souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good. For&nbsp;<A NAME="1045"></A>if
a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from&nbsp;<A NAME="1046"></A>the
first to sound philosophy, and had been moderately fortunate in the&nbsp;<A NAME="1047"></A>number
of the lot, he might, as the messenger reported, be happy here,&nbsp;<A NAME="1048"></A>and
also his journey to another life and return to this, instead of being&nbsp;<A NAME="1049"></A>rough
and underground, would be smooth and heavenly. Most curious, he said,&nbsp;<A NAME="1050"></A>was
the spectacle --sad and laughable and strange; for the choice of the&nbsp;<A NAME="1051"></A>souls
was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life. There&nbsp;<A NAME="1052"></A>he
saw the soul which had once been Orpheus choosing the life of a swan&nbsp;<A NAME="1053"></A>out
of enmity to the race of women, hating to be born of a woman because&nbsp;<A NAME="1054"></A>they
had been his murderers; he beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing&nbsp;<A NAME="1055"></A>the
life of a nightingale; birds, on the other hand, like the swan and&nbsp;<A NAME="1056"></A>other
musicians, wanting to be men. The soul which obtained the twentieth&nbsp;<A NAME="1057"></A>lot
chose the life of a lion, and this was the soul of Ajax the son of&nbsp;<A NAME="1058"></A>Telamon,
who would not be a man, remembering the injustice which was done&nbsp;<A NAME="1059"></A>him
the judgment about the arms. The next was Agamemnon, who took the life&nbsp;<A NAME="1060"></A>of
an eagle, because, like Ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his&nbsp;<A NAME="1061"></A>sufferings.
About the middle came the lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the&nbsp;<A NAME="1062"></A>great
fame of an athlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after&nbsp;<A NAME="1063"></A>her
there followed the soul of Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the&nbsp;<A NAME="1064"></A>nature
of a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who&nbsp;<A NAME="1065"></A>chose,
the soul of the jester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey.&nbsp;<A NAME="1066"></A>There
came also the soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and his&nbsp;<A NAME="1067"></A>lot
happened to be the last of them all. Now the recollection of former&nbsp;<A NAME="1068"></A>tolls
had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for a considerable&nbsp;<A NAME="1069"></A>time
in search of the life of a private man who had no cares; he had some&nbsp;<A NAME="1070"></A>difficulty
in finding this, which was lying about and had been neglected&nbsp;<A NAME="1071"></A>by
everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that he would have done&nbsp;<A NAME="1072"></A>the
had his lot been first instead of last, and that he was delighted to&nbsp;<A NAME="1073"></A>have
it. And not only did men pass into animals, but I must also mention&nbsp;<A NAME="1074"></A>that
there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and&nbsp;<A NAME="1075"></A>into
corresponding human natures --the good into the gentle and the evil&nbsp;<A NAME="1076"></A>into
the savage, in all sorts of combinations.&nbsp;<A NAME="1077"></A>

<P>All the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the&nbsp;<A NAME="1078"></A>order
of their choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they&nbsp;<A NAME="1079"></A>had
severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller&nbsp;<A NAME="1080"></A>of
the choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew them&nbsp;<A NAME="1081"></A>within
the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus ratifying&nbsp;<A NAME="1082"></A>the
destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to this, carried&nbsp;<A NAME="1083"></A>them
to Atropos, who spun the threads and made them irreversible, whence&nbsp;<A NAME="1084"></A>without
turning round they passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and&nbsp;<A NAME="1085"></A>when
they had all passed, they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain&nbsp;<A NAME="1086"></A>of
Forgetfulness, which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure;&nbsp;<A NAME="1087"></A>and
then towards evening they encamped by the river of Unmindfulness, whose&nbsp;<A NAME="1088"></A>water
no vessel can hold; of this they were all obliged to drink a certain&nbsp;<A NAME="1089"></A>quantity,
and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary;&nbsp;<A NAME="1090"></A>and
each one as he drank forgot all things. Now after they had gone to&nbsp;<A NAME="1091"></A>rest,
about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake,&nbsp;<A NAME="1092"></A>and
then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to&nbsp;<A NAME="1093"></A>their
birth, like stars shooting. He himself was hindered from drinking&nbsp;<A NAME="1094"></A>the
water. But in what manner or by what means he returned to the body&nbsp;<A NAME="1095"></A>he
could not say; only, in the morning, awaking suddenly, he found himself&nbsp;<A NAME="1096"></A>lying
on the pyre.&nbsp;<A NAME="1097"></A>

<P>And thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished,&nbsp;<A NAME="1098"></A>and
will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass&nbsp;<A NAME="1099"></A>safely
over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled.&nbsp;<A NAME="1100"></A>Wherefore
my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and&nbsp;<A NAME="1101"></A>follow
after justice and virtue always, considering that the soul is immortal&nbsp;<A NAME="1102"></A>and
able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil. Thus shall&nbsp;<A NAME="1103"></A>we
live dear to one another and to the gods, both while remaining here&nbsp;<A NAME="1104"></A>and
when, like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts, we&nbsp;<A NAME="1105"></A>receive
our reward. And it shall be well with us both in this life and&nbsp;<A NAME="1106"></A>in
the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been&nbsp;<A NAME="1107"></A>describing.&nbsp;<A NAME="end"></A>
