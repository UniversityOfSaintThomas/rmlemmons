<STRONG>SPRING 2001</STRONG> <FONT SIZE="+3"><STRONG>THE ETHICS OF AQUINAS</STRONG></FONT></P>
<BR>
<H1><STRONG>SECTION ONE: THE LOVE PRECEPTS</STRONG></H1>

<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ". . .it must be said that those two precepts [Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and Thou shalt love thy
neighbor, as stated in Matt. xxii. 37, 39] are the first and common precepts of natural law, that are
self-evident to human reason, either through nature or through faith. Wherefore all the precepts of the
decalogue are referred to these as conclusions to common principles." I-II.100.3 ad 1.</STRONG> <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
<H2><STRONG>II-II.44.7: WHETHER THE PRECEPT OF LOVE OF OUR
NEIGHBOR IS FITTINGLY EXPRESSED?</STRONG></H2>

<P>OBJ 1: It would seem that the precept of the love of our neighbor is unfittingly expressed. For the love of charity
extends to all men, even to our enemies, as may be seen in Mt. 5:44. But the word "neighbor" denotes a kind of
"nighness" which does not seem to exist towards all men. Therefore it seems that this precept is unfittingly
expressed.</P>

<P>OBJ 2: Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix, 8) "the origin of our friendly relations with others lies in
our relation to ourselves," whence it seems to follow that love of self is the origin of one's love for one's neighbor.
Now the principle is greater than that which results from it. Therefore man ought not to love his neighbor as
himself.</P>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, man loves himself, but not his neighbor, naturally. Therefore it is unfitting that he should be
commanded to love his neighbor as himself.</P>

<P>On the contrary, It is written (Mt. 22:39): "The second" commandment "is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor
as thyself."</P>

<P><STRONG><EM>I answer that,</EM></STRONG> This precept is fittingly expressed, for it indicates both the reason for loving and the mode of love.
The reason for loving is indicated in the word "neighbor," <STRONG>because</STRONG> the reason why we ought to love others out of
charity is <STRONG>because</STRONG> they are nigh to us, both as to the natural image of God, and as to the capacity for glory. Nor
does it matter whether we say "neighbor," or "brother" according to 1 Jn. 4:21, or "friend," according to Lev. 19:18,
<STRONG>because</STRONG> all these words express the same affinity.</P>

<P>The mode of love is indicated in the words "as thyself." This does not mean that a man must love his neighbor
equally as himself, but in like manner as himself, and this in three ways. First, as regards the end, namely, that he
should love his neighbor for God's sake, even as he loves himself for God's sake, so that his love for his neighbor is
a "holy" love. Secondly, as regards the rule of love, namely, that a man should not give way to his neighbor in evil,
but only in good things, even as he ought to gratify his will in good things alone, so that his love for his neighbor
may be a "righteous" love. Thirdly, as regards the reason for loving, namely, that a man should love his neighbor,
not for his own profit, or pleasure, but in the sense of wishing his neighbor well, even as he wishes himself well, so
that his love for his neighbor may be a "true" love: <STRONG>since</STRONG> when a man loves his neighbor for his own profit or
pleasure, he does not love his neighbor truly, but loves himself.</P>

<P>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
<H2><STRONG>I-II.29.4: WHETHER A MAN CAN HATE HIMSELF?</STRONG></H2>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> Properly speaking, it is impossible for a man to hate himself. For everything naturally desires good,
nor can anyone desire anything for himself, save under the aspect of good: for "evil is outside the scope of the
will," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). Now to love a man is to will good to him, as stated above (Q26, A4).
<STRONG>Consequently</STRONG>, a man must, of necessity, love himself; and it is impossible for a man to hate himself, properly
speaking.</P>

<P>But accidentally it happens that a man hates himself: and this in two ways. First, on the part of the good which a
man wills to himself. For it happens sometimes that what is desired as good in some particular respect, is simply
evil; and in this way, a man accidentally wills evil to himself; and <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> hates himself. Secondly, in regard to
himself, to whom he wills good. For each thing is that which is predominant in it; wherefore the state is said to do
what the king does, as if the king were the whole state. Now it is clear that man is principally the mind of man. And
it happens that some men account themselves as being principally that which they are in their material and sensitive
nature. Wherefore they love themselves according to what they take themselves to be, while they hate that which
they really are, by desiring what is contrary to reason. And in both these ways, "he that loveth iniquity hateth" not
only "his own soul," but also himself.<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
<H2>&nbsp;</H2>
<H2><STRONG>I-II.26.4: WHETHER LOVE IS PROPERLY DIVIDED INTO
LOVE-OF-FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE-OF-CONCUPISCENCE?</STRONG></H2>

<P>&nbsp;OBJ 1: It would seem that love is not properly divided into <EM>love-of-friendship</EM> and <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM>. For
"love is a passion, while friendship is a habit," according to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 5).</P>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 3) friendship is threefold, that which is founded on
"usefulness," that which is founded on "pleasure," and that which is founded on "goodness." But useful and
pleasant friendship are not without concupiscence. Therefore concupiscence should not be contrasted with
friendship.</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4), "to love is to wish good to someone." <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> the movement of
love has a twofold tendency: towards the good which a man wishes to someone (to himself or to another) and
towards that to which he wishes some good. Accordingly, man has <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM> towards the good that he
wishes to another, and <EM>love-of-friendship</EM> towards him to whom he wishes good.</P>

<P>Now the members of this division are related as primary and secondary: <STRONG>since</STRONG> that which is loved with the
<EM>love-of-friendship</EM> is loved simply and for itself; whereas that which is loved with the <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM>, is
loved, not simply and for itself, but for something else. For just as that which has existence, is a being simply,
while that which exists in another is a relative being; so, <STRONG>because</STRONG> good is convertible with being, the good, which
itself has goodness, is good simply; but that which is another's good, is a relative good. <STRONG>Consequently</STRONG> the love
with which a thing is loved, that it may have some good, is love simply; while the love, with which a thing is loved,
that it may be another's good, is relative love.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 1: Love is not divided into friendship and concupiscence, but into <EM>love-of-friendship</EM>, and
<EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM>. For a friend is, properly speaking, one to whom we wish good: while we are said to desire,
what we wish for ourselves.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 3: When friendship is based on usefulness or pleasure, a man does indeed wish his friend some good:
and in this respect the character of friendship is preserved. But <STRONG>since</STRONG> he refers this good further to his own pleasure
or use, the result is that friendship of the useful or pleasant, in so far as it is connected with <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM>,
loses the character to true friendship.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.27.3: WHETHER LIKENESS IS A CAUSE OF LOVE?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 1: It would seem that likeness is not a cause of love. For the same thing is not the cause of contraries. But
likeness is the cause of hatred; for it is written (Prov. 13:10) that "among the proud there are always contentions";
and the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 1) that "potters quarrel with one another." Therefore likeness is not a cause of
love.</P>

<P>OBJ 2: Further, Augustine says (Confess. iv, 14) that "a man loves in another that which he would not be himself:
<STRONG>Thus</STRONG> he loves an actor, but would not himself be an actor." But it would not be so, if likeness were the proper
cause of love; for in that case a man would love in another, that which he possesses himself, or would like to
possess. Therefore likeness is not a cause of love.</P>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, everyone loves that which he needs, even if he have it not: <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> a sick man loves health, and a
poor man loves riches. But in so far as he needs them and lacks them, he is unlike them. Therefore not only
likeness but also unlikeness is a cause of love.</P>

<P>OBJ 4: Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "we love those who bestow money and health on us; and also
those who retain their friendship for the dead." But all are not such. Therefore likeness is not a cause of love.</P>

<P><EM>On the contrary,</EM> It is written (Ecclus. 13:19): "Every beast loveth its like."</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> Likeness, properly speaking, is a cause of love. But it must be observed that likeness between things
is twofold. One kind of likeness arises from each thing having the same quality actually: for example, two things
possessing the quality of whiteness are said to be alike. Another kind of likeness arises from one thing having
potentially and by way of inclination, a quality which the other has actually: <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> we may say that a heavy body
existing outside its proper place is like another heavy body that exists in its proper place: or again, according as
potentiality bears a resemblance to its act; <STRONG>since</STRONG> act is contained, in a manner, in the potentiality itself.</P>

<P>Accordingly the first kind of likeness causes <EM>love-of-friendship</EM> or well-being. For the very fact that two men are
alike, having, as it were, one form, makes them to be, in a manner, one in that form: <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> two men are one thing in
the species of humanity, and two white men are one thing in whiteness. <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> the affections of one tend to the
other, as being one with him; and he wishes good to him as to himself. But the second kind of likeness causes
<EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM>, or friendship founded on usefulness or pleasure: <STRONG>because</STRONG> whatever is in potentiality, as
such, has the desire for its act; and it takes pleasure in its realization, if it be a sentient and cognitive being.</P>

<P>Now it has been stated above (Q26, A4), that in the <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM>, the lover, properly speaking, loves
himself, in willing the good that he desires. But a man loves himself more than another: <STRONG>because</STRONG> he is one with
himself substantially, whereas with another he is one only in the likeness of some form. <STRONG>Consequently</STRONG>, if this
other's likeness to him arising from the participation of a form, hinders him from gaining the good that he loves, he
becomes hateful to him, not for being like him, but for hindering him from gaining his own good. This is why
"potters quarrel among themselves," <STRONG>because</STRONG> they hinder one another's gain: and why "there are contentions among
the proud," <STRONG>because</STRONG> they hinder one another in attaining the position they covet.</P>

<P><STRONG>Hence</STRONG> the Reply to the First Objection is evident.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 2: Even when a man loves in another what he loves not in himself, there is a certain likeness of
proportion: <STRONG>because</STRONG> as the latter is to that which is loved in him, so is the former to that which he loves in himself:
for instance, if a good singer love a good writer, we can see a likeness of proportion, inasmuch as each one has that
which is becoming to him in respect of his art.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 3: He that loves what he needs, bears a likeness to what he loves, as potentiality bears a likeness to its
act, as stated above.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 4: According to the same likeness of potentiality to its act, the illiberal man loves the man who is
liberal, in so far as he expects from him something which he desires. The same applies to the man who is constant
in his friendship as compared to one who is inconstant. For in either case friendship seems to be based on
usefulness. We might also say that although not all men have these virtues in the complete habit, yet they have
them according to certain seminal principles in the reason, in force of which principles the man who is not virtuous
loves the virtuous man, as being in conformity with his own natural reason.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.28.2: WHETHER MUTUAL INDWELLING IS AN EFFECT OF
LOVE?</STRONG></FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> This effect of mutual indwelling may be understood as referring both to the apprehensive and to the
appetitive power. <STRONG>because</STRONG>, as to the apprehensive power, the beloved is said to be in the lover, inasmuch as the
beloved abides in the apprehension of the lover, according to Phil. 1:7, "For that I have you in my heart": while the
lover is said to be in the beloved, according to apprehension, inasmuch as the lover is not satisfied with a
superficial apprehension of the beloved, but strives to gain an intimate knowledge of everything pertaining to the
beloved, so as to penetrate into his very soul. <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> it is written concerning the Holy Ghost, Who is God's Love,
that He "searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God" (1 Cor. 2:10).</P>

<P>As the appetitive power, the object loved is said to be in the lover, inasmuch as it is in his affections, by a kind of
complacency: causing him either to take pleasure in it, or in its good, when present; or, in the absence of the object
loved, by his longing, to tend towards it with the <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM>, or towards the good that he wills to the
beloved, with the <EM>love-of-friendship</EM>: not indeed from any extrinsic cause (as when we desire one thing on account
of another, or wish good to another on account of something else), but <STRONG>because</STRONG> the complacency in the beloved is
rooted in the lover's heart. For this reason we speak of love as being "intimate"; and "of the bowels of charity." On
the other hand, the lover is in the beloved, by the <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM> and by the <EM>love-of-friendship</EM>, but not in
the same way. For the <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM> is not satisfied with any external or superficial possession or
enjoyment of the beloved; but seeks to possess the beloved perfectly, by penetrating into his heart, as it were.
Whereas, in the <EM>love-of-friendship</EM>, the lover is in the beloved, inasmuch as he reckons what is good or evil to his
friend, as being so to himself; and his friend's will as his own, so that it seems as though he felt the good or
suffered the evil in the person of his friend. <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> it is proper to friends "to desire the same things, and to grieve
and rejoice at the same," as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 3 and Rhet. ii, 4). <STRONG>Consequently</STRONG> in so far as he reckons
what affects his friend as affecting himself, the lover seems to be in the beloved, as though he were become one
with him: but in so far as, on the other hand, he wills and acts for his friend's sake as for his own sake, looking on
his friend as identified with himself, <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> the beloved is in the lover.</P>

<P>In yet a third way, mutual indwelling in the <EM>love-of-friendship</EM> can be understood in regard to reciprocal love:
inasmuch as friends return love for love, and both desire and do good things for one another.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.28.3: WHETHER ECSTASY IS AN EFFECT OF LOVE?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 1: It would seem that ecstasy is not an effect of love. For ecstasy seems to imply loss of reason. But love does
not always result in loss of reason: for lovers are masters of themselves at times. Therefore love does not cause
ecstasy.</P>

<P>OBJ 2: Further, the lover desires the beloved to be united to him. Therefore he draws the beloved to himself, rather
than betakes himself into the beloved, going forth out from himself as it were.</P>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, love unites the beloved to the lover, as stated above (A1). If, therefore, the lover goes out from
himself, in order to betake himself into the beloved, it follows that the lover always loves the beloved more than
himself: which is evidently false. Therefore ecstasy is not an effect of love.</P>

<P><EM>On the contrary,</EM> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the Divine love produces ecstasy," and that "God Himself
suffered ecstasy through love." <STRONG>since</STRONG> therefore according to the same author (Div. Nom. iv), every love is a
participated likeness of the Divine Love, it seems that every love causes ecstasy.<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><EM>I answer that, </EM>To suffer ecstasy means to be placed outside oneself. This happens as to the apprehensive power and
as to the appetitive power. As to the apprehensive power, a man is said to be placed outside himself, when he is
placed outside the knowledge proper to him. This may be due to his being raised to a higher knowledge; <STRONG>Thus</STRONG>, a
man is said to suffer ecstasy, inasmuch as he is placed outside the connatural apprehension of his sense and reason,
when he is raised up so as to comprehend things that surpass sense and reason: or it may be due to his being cast
down into a state of debasement; <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> a man may be said to suffer ecstasy, when he is overcome by violent
passion or madness. As to the appetitive power, a man is said to suffer ecstasy, when that power is borne towards
something else, so that it goes forth out from itself, as it were.</P>

<P>The first of these ecstasies is caused by love dispositively in so far, namely, as love makes the lover dwell on the
beloved, as stated above (A2), and to dwell intently on one thing draws the mind from other things. The second
ecstasy is caused by love directly; by <EM>love-of-friendship</EM>, simply; by <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM> not simply but in a
restricted sense. <STRONG>because</STRONG> in <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM>, the lover is carried out of himself, in a certain sense; in so far,
namely, as not being satisfied with enjoying the good that he has, he seeks to enjoy something outside himself. But
<STRONG>since</STRONG> he seeks to have this extrinsic good for himself, he does not go out from himself simply, and this movement
remains finally within him. On the other hand, in the <EM>love-of-friendship</EM>, a man's affection goes out from itself
simply; <STRONG>because</STRONG> he wishes and does good to his friend, by caring and providing for him, for his sake.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 1: This argument is true of the first kind of ecstasy.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 2: This argument applies to <EM>love-of-concupiscence</EM>, which, as stated above, does not cause ecstasy
simply.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 3: He who loves, goes out from himself, in so far as he wills the good of his friend and works for it. Yet
he does not will the good of his friend more than his own good: and so it does not follow that he loves another
more than himself.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+3"><STRONG>SECTION TWO: THE NATURAL LAW</STRONG></FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.90.2: WHETHER THERE IS IN US A NATURAL LAW?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 2: By the law man is directed, in his acts, to the end, as stated above (Q90, A2). But the directing of human
acts to their end is not a function of nature, as is the case in irrational creatures, which act for an end solely by their
natural appetite; whereas man acts for an end by his reason and will. Therefore no law is natural to man.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 2: Every act of reason and will in us is based on that which is according to nature, as stated above (Q10,
A1): for every act of reasoning is based on principles that are known naturally, and every act of appetite in respect
of the means is derived from the natural appetite in respect of the last end. Accordingly the first direction of our
acts to their end must needs be in virtue of the natural law.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.94.2: WHETHER THE NATURAL LAW CONTAINS SEVERAL
PRECEPTS, OR ONLY ONE?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 1: It would seem that the natural law contains, not several precepts, but one only. For law is a kind of precept,
as stated above (Q92, A2). If therefore there were many precepts of the natural law, it would follow that there are
also many natural laws.</P>

<P>OBJ 2: Further, the natural law is consequent to human nature. But human nature, as a whole, is one; though, as to
its parts, it is manifold. Therefore, either there is but one precept of the law of nature, on account of the unity of
nature as a whole; or there are many, by reason of the number of parts of human nature. The result would be that
even things relating to the inclination of the concupiscible faculty belong to the natural law.</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> . . .Now a certain order is to be found in those things that are apprehended universally. For that
which, before aught else, falls under apprehension, is "being," the notion of which is included in all things
whatsoever a man apprehends. Wherefore the first indemonstrable principle is that "the same thing cannot be
affirmed and denied at the same time," which is based on the notion of "being" and "not-being": and on this
principle all others are based, as is stated in Metaph. iv, text. 9. Now as "being" is the first thing that falls under the
apprehension simply, so "good" is the first thing that falls under the apprehension of the practical reason, which is
directed to action: <STRONG>since</STRONG> every agent acts for an end under the aspect of good. <STRONG><EM>Consequently</EM></STRONG><EM> the first principle of
practical reason is one founded on the notion of good, viz. that "good is that which all things seek after." <STRONG>Hence</STRONG>
this is the first precept of law, that "good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided." All other precepts
of the natural law are based upon this: so that whatever the practical reason naturally apprehends as man's good
(or evil) belongs to the precepts of the natural law as something to be done or avoided.</EM> </P>

<P><STRONG>Since</STRONG>, however, good has the nature of an end, and evil, the nature of a contrary, <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> it is that all those things to
which man has a natural inclination, are naturally apprehended by reason as being good, and <STRONG>Consequently</STRONG> as
objects of pursuit, and their contraries as evil, and objects of avoidance. Wherefore according to the order of natural
inclinations, is the order of the precepts of the natural law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Because</STRONG> in man there is first of all an inclination to good in accordance with the nature which he has in common
with all substances: inasmuch as every substance seeks the preservation of its own being, according to its nature:
and by reason of this inclination, whatever is a means of preserving human life, and of warding off its obstacles,
belongs to the natural law.</P>

<P>Secondly, there is in man an inclination to things that pertain to him more specially, according to that nature which
he has in common with other animals: and in virtue of this inclination, those things are said to belong to the natural
law, "which nature has taught to all animals" [*Pandect. Just. I, tit. i], such as sexual intercourse, education of
offspring and so forth.</P>

<P>Thirdly, there is in man an inclination to good, according to the nature of his reason, which nature is proper to him:
<STRONG>Thus</STRONG> man has a natural inclination to know the truth about God, and to live in society: and in this respect, whatever
pertains to this inclination belongs to the natural law; for instance, to shun ignorance, to avoid offending those
among whom one has to live, and other such things regarding the above inclination.<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 1: All these precepts of the law of nature have the character of one natural law, inasmuch as they flow
from one first precept.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 2: All the inclinations of any parts whatsoever of human nature, e.g. of the concupiscible and irascible
parts, in so far as they are ruled by reason, belong to the natural law, and are reduced to one first precept, as stated
above: so that the precepts of the natural law are many in themselves, but are based on one common foundation.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.94.3: WHETHER ALL ACTS OF VIRTUE ARE PRESCRIBED
BY THE NATURAL LAW?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P><EM>On the contrary,</EM> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 4) that "virtues are natural." Therefore virtuous acts also are a
subject of the natural law.</P>

<P><EM>I answer that, </EM>We may speak of virtuous acts in two ways: first, under the aspect of virtuous; secondly, as such and
such acts considered in their proper species. If then we speak of acts of virtue, considered as virtuous, <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> all
virtuous acts belong to the natural law. For it has been stated (A2) that to the natural law belongs everything to
which a man is inclined according to his nature. Now each thing is inclined naturally to an operation that is suitable
to it according to its form: <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> fire is inclined to give heat. Wherefore, <STRONG>since</STRONG> the rational soul is the proper form
of man, there is in every man a natural inclination to act according to reason: and this is to act according to virtue.
<STRONG>Consequently</STRONG>, considered thus, all acts of virtue are prescribed by the natural law: <STRONG>since</STRONG> each one's reason
naturally dictates to him to act virtuously.</P>

<P>But if we speak of virtuous acts, considered in themselves, i.e. in their proper species, <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> not all virtuous acts are
prescribed by the natural law: for many things are done virtuously, to which nature does not incline at first; but
which, through the inquiry of reason, have been found by men to be conducive to well-living.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.94.4: WHETHER THE NATURAL LAW IS THE SAME IN ALL
MEN?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, as stated above (AA2,3), to the natural law belongs everything to which a man is inclined
according to his nature. Now different men are naturally inclined to different things; some to the desire of
pleasures, others to the desire of honors, and other men to other things. Therefore there is not one natural law for
all.</P>

<P><EM>On the contrary,</EM> Isidore says (Etym. v, 4): "The natural law is common to all nations."</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As stated above (AA2,3), to the natural law belongs those things to which a man is inclined
naturally: and among these it is proper to man to be inclined to act according to reason. Now the process of reason
is from the common to the proper, as stated in Phys. i. The speculative reason, however, is differently situated in
this matter, from the practical reason. For, <STRONG>since</STRONG> the speculative reason is busied chiefly with the necessary things,
which cannot be otherwise than they are, its proper conclusions, like the universal principles, contain the truth
without fail. The practical reason, on the other hand, is busied with contingent matters, about which human actions
are concerned: and <STRONG><EM>Consequently</EM></STRONG><EM>, although there is necessity in the general principles, the more we descend to
matters of detail, the more frequently we encounter defects.</EM> Accordingly then in speculative matters truth is the
same in all men, both as to principles and as to conclusions: although the truth is not known to all as regards the
conclusions, but only as regards the principles which are called common notions. But in matters of action, truth or
practical rectitude is not the same for all, as to matters of detail, but only as to the general principles: and where
there is the same rectitude in matters of detail, it is not equally known to all.</P>

<P>It is therefore evident that, <EM>as regards the general principles whether of speculative or of practical reason, truth or
rectitude is the same for all, and is equally known by all.</EM> As to the proper conclusions of the speculative reason, the
truth is the same for all, but is not equally known to all: <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> it is true for all that the three angles of a triangle are
together equal to two right angles, although it is not known to all. <EM>But as to the proper conclusions of the practical
reason, neither is the truth or rectitude the same for all, nor, where it is the same, is it equally known by all. </EM><STRONG>Thus</STRONG>
it is right and true for all to act according to reason: and from this principle it follows as a proper conclusion, that
goods entrusted to another should be restored to their owner. Now this is true for the majority of cases: but it may
happen in a particular case that it would be injurious, and therefore unreasonable, to restore goods held in trust; for
instance, if they are claimed for the purpose of fighting against one's country. And this principle will be found to
fail the more, according as we descend further into detail, e.g. if one were to say that goods held in trust should be
restored with such and such a guarantee, or in such and such a way; <STRONG><EM>because</EM></STRONG><EM> the greater the number of conditions
added, the greater the number of ways in which the principle may fail, so that it be not right to restore or not to
restore.</EM> </P>

<P><STRONG>Consequently</STRONG> we must say that the natural law, as to general principles, is the same for all, both as to rectitude and
as to knowledge. But as to certain matters of detail, which are conclusions, as it were, of those general principles, it
is the same for all in the majority of cases, both as to rectitude and as to knowledge; and yet in some few cases it
may fail, both as to rectitude, by reason of certain obstacles (just as natures subject to generation and corruption fail
in some few cases on account of some obstacle), and as to knowledge, <STRONG>since</STRONG> in some the reason is perverted by
passion, or evil habit, or an evil disposition of nature; <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> formerly, theft, although it is expressly contrary to the
natural law, was not considered wrong among the Germans, as Julius Caesar relates (De Bello Gall. vi).</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 3: As, in man, reason rules and commands the other powers, so all the natural inclinations belonging to
the other powers must needs be directed according to reason. Wherefore it is universally right for all men, that all
their inclinations should be directed according to reason.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.94.6: WHETHER THE LAW OF NATURE CAN BE
ABOLISHED FROM THE HEART OF MAN?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As stated above (AA4,5), there belong to the natural law, first, certain most general precepts, that are
known to all; and secondly, certain secondary and more detailed precepts, which are, as it were, conclusions
following closely from first principles. As to those general principles, the natural law, in the abstract, can nowise be
blotted out from men's hearts. But it is blotted out in the case of a particular action, in so far as reason is hindered
from applying the general principle to a particular point of practice, on account of concupiscence or some other
passion, as stated above (Q77, A2). But as to the other, i.e. the secondary precepts, the natural law can be blotted
out from the human heart, either by evil persuasions, just as in speculative matters errors occur in respect of
necessary conclusions; or by vicious customs and corrupt habits, as among some men, theft, and even unnatural
vices, as the Apostle states (Rm. i), were not esteemed sinful.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.90.6: WHETHER THERE IS A LAW IN THE FOMES OF SIN?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 1: It would seem that there is no law of the "fomes" of sin. For Isidore says (Etym. v) that the "law is based on
reason." But the "fomes" of sin is not based on reason, but deviates from it. Therefore the "fomes" has not the
nature of a law.</P>

<P><EM>On the contrary, </EM>The Apostle says (Rm. 7:23): "I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my
mind."</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As stated above (A2; Q90, A1, ad 1), the law, as to its essence, resides in him that rules and
measures; but, by way of participation, in that which is ruled and measured; so that every inclination or ordination
which may be found in things subject to the law, is called a law by participation, as stated above (A2; Q90, A1, ad
1). Now those who are subject to a law may receive a twofold inclination from the lawgiver. First, in so far as he
directly inclines his subjects to something; sometimes indeed different subjects to different acts; in this way we
may say that there is a military law and a mercantile law. Secondly, indirectly; <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> by the very fact that a lawgiver
deprives a subject of some dignity, the latter passes into another order, so as to be under another law, as it were:
<STRONG>Thus</STRONG> if a soldier be turned out of the army, he becomes a subject of rural or of mercantile legislation.</P>

<P>Accordingly under the Divine Lawgiver various creatures have various natural inclinations, so that what is, as it
were, a law for one, is against the law for another: <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> I might say that fierceness is, in a way, the law of a dog,
but against the law of a sheep or another meek animal. And so the law of man, which, by the Divine ordinance, is
allotted to him, according to his proper natural condition, is that he should act in accordance with reason: and this
law was so effective in the primitive state, that nothing either beside or against reason could take man unawares.
But when man turned his back on God, he fell under the influence of his sensual impulses: in fact this happens to
each one individually, the more he deviates from the path of reason, so that, after a fashion, he is likened to the
beasts that are led by the impulse of sensuality, according to Ps. 48:21: "Man, when he was in honor, did not
understand: he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them."</P>

<P>So, then, this very inclination of sensuality which is called the "fomes," in other animals has simply the nature of a
law (yet only in so far as a law may be said to be in such things), by reason of a direct inclination. But in man, it has
not the nature of law in this way, rather is it a deviation from the law of reason. But <STRONG>since</STRONG>, by the just sentence of
God, man is destitute of original justice, and his reason bereft of its vigor, this impulse of sensuality, whereby he is
led, in so far as it is a penalty following from the Divine law depriving man of his proper dignity, has the nature of
a law.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 1: This argument considers the "fomes" in itself, as an incentive to evil. It is not <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> that it has the
nature of a law, as stated above, but according as it results from the justice of the Divine law: it is as though we
were to say that the law allows a nobleman to be condemned to hard labor for some misdeed.<BR>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+3"><STRONG>SECTION THREE: THE DECALOGUE'S MORAL
PRECEPTS</STRONG></FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><STRONG><EM>The Decalogue is an old-fashion way of referring to the Ten Commandment</EM></STRONG>s<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>I-II.100.1: WHETHER A</STRONG></FONT><STRONG>LL THE MORAL PRECEPTS OF THE OLD DIVINE LAW BELONG TO
THE NATUAL LAW?</STRONG> </P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> The moral precepts, distinct from the ceremonial and judicial precepts, are about things pertaining of
their very nature to good morals. Now <STRONG>since</STRONG> human morals depend on their relation to reason, which is the proper
principle of human acts, those morals are called good which accord with reason, and those are called bad which are
discordant from reason. And as every judgment of speculative reason proceeds from the natural knowledge of first
principles, so every judgment of practical reason proceeds from principles known naturally, as stated above (Q94,
AA2,4): from which principles one may proceed in various ways to judge of various matters. For some matters
connected with human actions are so evident, that after very little consideration one is able at once to approve or
disapprove of them by means of these general first principles: while some matters cannot be the subject of
judgment without much consideration of the various circumstances, which all are not competent to do carefully, but
only those who are wise: just as it is not possible for all to consider the particular conclusions of sciences, but only
for those who are versed in philosophy: and lastly there are some matters of which man cannot judge unless he be
helped by Divine instruction; such as the articles of faith.</P>

<P>It is therefore evident that <STRONG>since</STRONG> the moral precepts are about matters which concern good morals; and <STRONG>since</STRONG> good
morals are those which are in accord with reason; and <STRONG>since</STRONG> also every judgment of human reason must needs by
derived in some way from natural reason; it follows, of necessity, that all the moral precepts belong to the law of
nature; but not all in the same way. For there are certain things which the natural reason of every man, of its own
accord and at once, judges to be done or not to be done: e.g. "Honor thy father and thy mother," and "Thou shalt not
kill, Thou shalt not steal": and these belong to the law of nature absolutely. And there are certain things which, after
a more careful consideration, wise men deem obligatory. Such belong to the law of nature, yet so that they need to
be inculcated, the wiser teaching the less wise: e.g. "Rise up before the hoary head, and honor the person of the
aged man," and the like. And there are some things, to judge of which, human reason needs Divine instruction,
whereby we are taught about the things of God: e.g. "Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness
of anything; Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain."<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.100.2: WHETHER THE MORAL PRECEPTS OF THE LAW
ARE ABOUT ALL THE ACTS OF VIRTUE?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P><EM>I answer that</EM> . . . .It is therefore evident that the Divine law fittingly proposes precepts about the acts of all the
virtues: yet so that certain matters, without which the order of virtue, which is the order of reason, cannot even
exist, come under an obligation of precept; while other matters, which pertain to the well-being of perfect virtue,
come under an admonition of counsel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.100.3: WHETHER ALL THE MORAL PRECEPTS OF THE OLD
LAW ARE REDUCIBLE TO THE TEN PRECEPTS OF THE
DECALOGUE?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 1: It would seem that not all the moral precepts of the Old Law are reducible to the ten precepts of the
Decalogue. For the first and principal precepts of the Law are, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God," and "Thou shalt
love thy neighbor," as stated in Mt. 22:37,39. But these two are not contained in the precepts of the Decalogue.
Therefore not all the moral precepts are contained in the precepts of the Decalogue.</P>

<P>OBJ 2: Further, the moral precepts are not reducible to the ceremonial precepts, but rather vice versa. But among
the precepts of the Decalogue, one is ceremonial, viz. "Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath-day." Therefore
the moral precepts are not reducible to all the precepts of the Decalogue.</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> The precepts of the Decalogue differ from the other precepts of the Law, in the fact that God Himself
is said to have given the precepts of the Decalogue; whereas He gave the other precepts to the people through
Moses. Wherefore the Decalogue includes those precepts the knowledge of which man has immediately from God.
Such are those which with but slight reflection can be gathered at once from the first general principles: and those
also which become known to man immediately through divinely infused faith. <STRONG><EM>Consequently</EM></STRONG><EM> two kinds of precepts
are not reckoned among the precepts of the Decalogue: viz. first general principles, for they need no further
promulgation after being once imprinted on the natural reason to which they are self-evident; as, for instance, that
one should do evil to no man, and other similar principles: and again those which the careful reflection of wise
men shows to be in accord with reason;</EM><STRONG>since</STRONG> the people receive these principles from God, through being taught by
wise men. Nevertheless both kinds of precepts are contained in the precepts of the Decalogue; yet in different ways.
<EM>For the first general principles are contained in them, as principles in their proximate conclusions; while those
which are known through wise men are contained, conversely, as conclusions in their principles.</EM> </P>

<P>Reply OBJ 1: Those two principles are the first general principles of the natural law, and are self-evident to human
reason, either through nature or through faith. Wherefore all the precepts of the Decalogue are referred to these, as
conclusions to general principles.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 2: The precept of the Sabbath observance is moral in one respect, in so far as it commands man to give
some time to the things of God, according to Ps. 45:11: "Be still and see that I am God." In this respect it is placed
among the precepts of the Decalogue: but not as to the fixing of the time, in which respect it is a ceremonial precept.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.100.5: WHETHER THE DECALOGUE PRECEPTS OF THE
DECALOGUE ARE SUFFICIENT?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 1: . . . Since, the decalogue does not include any precepts directing man in his relations to himself, but only
such as direct him in his relations to God and himself, it seems that the precepts of the decalogue are insufficiently
enumerated.</P>

<P>OBJ 5: Further, in every kind of sin, it is possible to sin in thought or in deed. But in some kinds of sin, namely in
theft and adultery, the prohibition of sins of deed, when it is said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not
steal," is distinct from the prohibition of the sin of thought, when it is said, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's
goods," and, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife." Therefore the same should have been done in regard to the
sins of homicide and false witness.</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As stated above (A2), just as the precepts of human law direct man in his relations to the human
community, so the precepts of the Divine law direct man in his relations to a community or commonwealth of men
under God. Now in order that any man may dwell aright in a community, two things are required: the first is that he
behave well to the head of the community; the other is that he behave well to those who are his fellows and
partners in the community. It is therefore necessary that the Divine law should contain in the first place precepts
ordering man in his relations to God; and in the second place, other precepts ordering man in his relations to other
men who are his neighbors and live with him under God.</P>

<P>Now man owes three things to the head of the community: first, fidelity; secondly, reverence; thirdly, service.
Fidelity to his master consists in his not giving sovereign honor to another: and this is the sense of the first
commandment, in the words "Thou shalt not have strange gods." Reverence to his master requires that he should do
nothing injurious to him: and this is conveyed by the second commandment, "Thou shalt not take the name of the
Lord thy God in vain." Service is due to the master in return for the benefits which his subjects receive from him:
and to this belongs the third commandment of the sanctification of the Sabbath in memory of the creation of all
things.</P>

<P>To his neighbors a man behaves himself well both in particular and in general. In particular, as to those to whom he
is indebted, by paying his debts: and in this sense is to be taken the commandment about honoring one's parents. In
general, as to all men, by doing harm to none, either by deed, or by word, or by thought. By deed, harm is done to
one's neighbor---sometimes in his person, i.e. as to his personal existence; and this is forbidden by the words,
"Thou shalt not kill": sometimes in a person united to him, as to the propagation of offspring; and this is prohibited
by the words, "Thou shalt not commit adultery": sometimes in his possessions, which are directed to both the
aforesaid; and with this regard to this it is said, "Thou shalt not steal." Harm done by word is forbidden when it is
said, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor": harm done by thought is forbidden in the words,
"Thou shalt not covet."</P>

<P>The three precepts that direct man in his behavior towards God may also be differentiated in this same way. For the
first refers to deeds; wherefore it is said, "Thou shalt not make . . . a graven thing": the second, to words; wherefore
it is said, "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain": the third, to thoughts; <STRONG>because</STRONG> the
sanctification of the Sabbath, as the subject of a moral precept, requires repose of the heart in God. Or, according to
Augustine (In Ps. 32: Conc. 1), by the first commandment we reverence the unity of the First Principle; by the
second, the Divine truth; by the third, His goodness whereby we are sanctified, and wherein we rest as in our last
end.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 1: <STRONG>". . .love of oneself is contained in the love of God and of one's neighbor: since true self-love
consists in directing oneself to God. And for this reason the decalogue includes those precepts only which
refer to our neighbor and to God.</STRONG> </P>

<P>Reply OBJ 5: The pleasure of adultery and the usefulness of wealth, in so far as they have the character of
pleasurable or useful good, are of themselves, objects of appetite: and for this reason they needed to be forbidden
not only in the deed but also in the desire. But murder and falsehood are, of themselves, objects of repulsion (since
it is natural for man to love his neighbor and the truth): and are desired only for the sake of something else.
<STRONG>Consequently</STRONG> with regard to sins of murder and false witness, it was necessary to proscribe, not sins of thought,
but only sins of deed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.100.6: WHETHER THE ORDER OF THE DECALOGUE
PRECEPTS IS PROPER?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As stated above (AA3,5, ad 1), the precepts of the Decalogue are such as the mind of man is ready to
grasp at once. Now it is evident that a thing is so much the more easily grasped by the reason, as its contrary is
more grievous and repugnant to reason. Moreover, it is clear, <STRONG>since</STRONG> the order of reason begins with the end, that, for
a man to be inordinately disposed towards his end, is supremely contrary to reason. Now the end of human life and
society is God. <STRONG>Consequently</STRONG> it was necessary for the precepts of the Decalogue, first of all, to direct man to God;
<STRONG>since</STRONG> the contrary to this is most grievous. <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> also, in an army, which is ordained to the commander as to its end,
it is requisite first that the soldier should be subject to the commander, and the opposite of this is most grievous;
and secondly it is requisite that he should be in coordination with the other soldiers.</P>

<P>Now among those things whereby we are ordained to God, the first is that man should be subjected to Him
faithfully, by having nothing in common with His enemies. The second is that he should show Him reverence: the
third that he should offer Him service. <STRONG>Thus</STRONG>, in an army, it is a greater sin for a soldier to act treacherously and
make a compact with the foe, than to be insolent to his commander: and this last is more grievous than if he be
found wanting in some point of service to him.</P>

<P>As to the precepts that direct man in his behavior towards his neighbor, it is evident that it is more repugnant to
reason, and a more grievous sin, if man does not observe the due order as to those persons to whom he is most
indebted. <STRONG>Consequently</STRONG>, among those precepts that direct man in his relations to his neighbor, the first place is
given to that one which regards his parents. Among the other precepts we again find the order to be according to
the gravity of sin. For it is more grave and more repugnant to reason, to sin by deed than by word; and by word than
by thought. And among sins of deed, murder which destroys life in one already living is more grievous than
adultery, which imperils the life of the unborn child; and adultery is more grave than theft, which regards external goods.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.100.7: WHETHER THE PRECEPTS OF THE DECALOGUE
ARE SUITABLY FORMULATED?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 1: It would seem that the precepts of the Decalogue are unsuitably formulated. <STRONG>because</STRONG> the affirmative
precepts direct man to acts of virtue, while the negative precepts withdraw him from acts of vice. But in every
matter there are virtues and vices opposed to one another. Therefore in whatever matter there is an ordinance of a
precept of the Decalogue, there should have been an affirmative and a negative precept. Therefore it was unfitting
that affirmative precepts should be framed in some matters, and negative precepts in others.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 1: Affirmation of one thing always leads to the denial of its opposite: but the denial of one opposite
does not always lead to the affirmation of the other. For it follows that if a thing is white, it is not black: but it does
not follow that if it is not black, it is white: <STRONG>because</STRONG> negation extends further than affirmation. And <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> too, that
one ought not to do harm to another, which pertains to the negative precepts, extends to more persons, as a primary
dictate of reason, than that one ought to do someone a service or kindness. Nevertheless it is a primary dictate of
reason that man is a debtor in the point of rendering a service or kindness to those from whom he has received
kindness, if he has not yet repaid the debt. Now there are two whose favors no man can sufficiently repay, viz. God
and man's father, as stated in Ethic. viii, 14. Therefore it is that there are only two affirmative precepts; one about
the honor due to parents, the other about the celebration of the Sabbath in memory of the Divine favor.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.100.8: WHETHER THE PRECEPTS OF THE DECALOGUE
ARE DISPENSABLE?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, among the precepts of the Decalogue is one forbidding murder. But it seems that a dispensation is
given by men in this precept: for instance, when according to the prescription of human law, such as evil-doers or
enemies are lawfully slain. Therefore the precepts of the Decalogue are dispensable.</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As stated above (Q96, A6; Q97, A4), precepts admit of dispensation, when there occurs a particular
case in which, if the letter of the law be observed, the intention of the lawgiver is frustrated. Now the intention of
every lawgiver is directed first and chiefly to the common good; secondly, to the order of justice and virtue,
whereby the common good is preserved and attained. If therefore there by any precepts which contain the very
preservation of the common good, or the very order of justice and virtue, such precepts contain the intention of the
lawgiver, and therefore are indispensable. For instance, if in some community a law were enacted, such as
this---that no man should work for the destruction of the commonwealth, or betray the state to its enemies, or that
no man should do anything unjust or evil, such precepts would not admit of dispensation. But if other precepts
were enacted, subordinate to the above, and determining certain special modes of procedure, these latter precepts
would admit of dispensation, in so far as the omission of these precepts in certain cases would not be prejudicial to
the former precepts which contain the intention of the lawgiver. For instance if, for the safeguarding of the
commonwealth, it were enacted in some city that from each ward some men should keep watch as sentries in case
of siege, some might be dispensed from this on account of some greater utility.</P>

<P>Now the precepts of the Decalogue contain the very intention of the lawgiver, who is God. For the precepts of the
first table, which direct us to God, contain the very order to the common and final good, which is God; while the
precepts of the second table contain the order of justice to be observed among men, that nothing undue be done to
anyone, and that each one be given his due; for it is in this sense that we are to take the precepts of the Decalogue.
<STRONG>Consequently</STRONG> the precepts of the Decalogue admit of no dispensation whatever.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 3: The slaying of a man is forbidden in the Decalogue, in so far as it bears the character of something
undue: for in this sense the precept contains the very essence of justice. Human law cannot make it lawful for a
man to be slain unduly. But it is not undue for evil-doers or foes of the common weal to be slain: <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> this is not
contrary to the precept of the Decalogue; and such a killing is no murder as forbidden by that precept, as Augustine
observes (De Lib. Arb. i, 4). In like manner when a man's property is taken from him, if it be due that he should
lose it, this is not theft or robbery as forbidden by the Decalogue. . . . .</P>

<P><EM>Accordingly, therefore, the precepts of the Decalogue, as to the essence of justice which they contain, are
unchangeable: but as to any determination by application to individual actions---for instance, that this or that be
murder, theft or adultery, or not---in this point they admit of change.</EM> </P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.100.11: WHETHER IT IS RIGHT TO DISTINGUISH OTHER
MORAL PRECEPTS OF THE LAW BESIDES THE DECALOGUE?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As is evident from what has been stated (Q99, AA3,4), the judicial and ceremonial precepts derive
their force from their institution alone: <STRONG>since</STRONG> before they were instituted, it seemed of no consequence whether
things were done in this or that way. But the moral precepts derive their efficacy from the very dictate of natural
reason, even if they were never included in the Law. Now of these there are three grades: for some are most certain,
and so evident as to need no promulgation; such as the commandments of the love of God and our neighbor, and
others like these, as stated above (A3), which are, as it were, the ends of the commandments; wherefore no man can
have an erroneous judgment about them. Some precepts are more detailed, the reason of which even an uneducated
man can easily grasp; and yet they need to be promulgated, <STRONG>because</STRONG> human judgment, in a few instances, happens
to be led astray concerning them: these are the precepts of the Decalogue. Again, there are some precepts the reason
of which is not so evident to everyone, but only the wise; these are moral precepts added to the Decalogue, and
given to the people by God through Moses and Aaron. But <STRONG>since</STRONG> the things that are evident are the principles
whereby we know those that are not evident, these other moral precepts added to the Decalogue are reducible to the
precepts of the Decalogue, as so many corollaries.<BR>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+3"><STRONG>SECTION FOUR: CONCERNING POLITICS,
WAR, REVOLUTIONS AND KILLING</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>II-II.79.1: WHETHER TO DECLINE FROM EVIL AND TO DO
GOOD ARE PARTS OF JUSTICE?</STRONG></FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><EM>I answer that, </EM>If we speak of good and evil in general, it belongs to every virtue to do good and to avoid evil: and in
this sense they cannot be reckoned parts of justice, except justice be taken in the sense of "all virtue" [*Cf. Q58,
A5]. . . .On the other hand justice considered as a special virtue regards good as due to one's neighbor. And in this
sense it belongs to special justice to do good considered as due to one's neighbor, and to avoid the opposite evil,
that, namely, which is hurtful to one's neighbor; while it belongs to general justice to do good in relation to the
community or in relation to God, and to avoid the opposite evil.</P>

<P>Now these two are said to be quasi-integral parts of general or of special justice, <STRONG>because</STRONG> each is required for the
perfect act of justice. For it belongs to justice to establish equality in our relations with others, as shown above
(Q58, A2): and it pertains to the same cause to establish and to preserve that which it has established. Now a person
establishes the equality of justice by doing good, i.e. by rendering to another his due: and he preserves the already
established equality of justice by declining from evil, that is by inflicting no injury on his neighbor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.90.2: WHETHER THE LAW IS ALWAYS SOMETHING
DIRECTED TO THE COMMON GOOD?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As stated above (A1), the law belongs to that which is a principle of human acts, <STRONG>because</STRONG> it is their
rule and measure. Now as reason is a principle of human acts, so in reason itself there is something which is the
principle in respect of all the rest: wherefore to this principle chiefly and mainly law must needs be referred. Now
the first principle in practical matters, which are the object of the practical reason, is the last end: and the last end of
human life is bliss or happiness, as stated above (Q2, A7; Q3, A1). <STRONG>Consequently</STRONG> the law must needs regard
principally the relationship to happiness. Moreover, <STRONG>since</STRONG> every part is ordained to the whole, as imperfect to
perfect; and <STRONG>since</STRONG> one man is a part of the perfect community, the law must needs regard properly the relationship
to universal happiness. Wherefore the Philosopher, in the above definition of legal matters mentions both happiness
and the body politic: for he says (Ethic. v, 1) that we call those legal matters "just, which are adapted to produce
and preserve happiness and its parts for the body politic": <STRONG>since</STRONG> the state is a perfect community, as he says in Polit.
i, 1.</P>

<P>Now in every genus, that which belongs to it chiefly is the principle of the others, and the others belong to that
genus in subordination to that thing: <STRONG>Thus</STRONG> fire, which is chief among hot things, is the cause of heat in mixed
bodies, and these are said to be hot in so far as they have a share of fire. <STRONG>Consequently</STRONG>, <STRONG>since</STRONG> the law is chiefly
ordained to the common good, any other precept in regard to some individual work, must needs be devoid of the
nature of a law, save in so far as it regards the common good. Therefore every law is ordained to the common good.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>I-II.90.3: WHETHER THE REASON OF ANY MAN IS
COMPETENT TO MAKE LAWS?</STRONG></FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P><EM>I answer that</EM>, A law, properly speaking, regards first and foremost the order to the common good. Now to order
anything to the common good, belongs either to the whole people, or to someone who is the viceregent of the
whole people. And therefore the making of a law belongs either to the whole people or to a public personage who
has care of the whole people: <STRONG>since</STRONG> in all other matters the directing of anything to the end concerns him to whom
the end belongs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>II-II.40.1: WHETHER IT IS ALWAYS SINFUL TO WAGE WAR?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> In order for a war to be just, three things are necessary. <STRONG>First</STRONG>, the authority of the sovereign by whose
command the war is to be waged. For it is not the business of a private individual to declare war, <STRONG>because</STRONG> he can
seek for redress of his rights from the tribunal of his superior. Moreover it is not the business of a private individual
to summon together the people, which has to be done in wartime. And as the care of the common weal is
committed to those who are in authority, it is their business to watch over the common weal of the city, kingdom or
province subject to them. And just as it is lawful for them to have recourse to the sword in defending that common
weal against internal disturbances, when they punish evil-doers, according to the words of the Apostle (Rm. 13:4):
"He beareth not the sword in vain: for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil";
so too, it is their business to have recourse to the sword of war in defending the common weal against external
enemies. <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> it is said to those who are in authority (Ps. 81:4): "Rescue the poor: and deliver the needy out of
the hand of the sinner"; and for this reason Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxii, 75): "The natural order conducive to
peace among mortals demands that the power to declare and counsel war should be in the hands of those who hold
the supreme authority."</P>

<P><STRONG>Secondly</STRONG>, a just cause is required, namely that those who are attacked, should be attacked <STRONG>because</STRONG> they deserve it
on account of some fault. Wherefore Augustine says (QQ. in Hept., qu. x, super Jos.): "A just war is wont to be
described as one that avenges wrongs, when a nation or state has to be punished, for refusing to make amends for
the wrongs inflicted by its subjects, or to restore what it has seized unjustly."</P>

<P><STRONG>Thirdly</STRONG>, it is necessary that the belligerents should have a rightful intention, so that they intend the advancement of
good, or the avoidance of evil. <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> Augustine says (De Verb. Dom. [*The words quoted are to be found not in
St. Augustine's works, but Can. Apud. Caus. xxiii, qu. 1]): "True religion looks upon as peaceful those wars that
are waged not for motives of aggrandizement, or cruelty, but with the object of securing peace, of punishing
evil-doers, and of uplifting the good." For it may happen that the war is declared by the legitimate authority, and for
a just cause, and yet be rendered unlawful through a wicked intention. <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxii,
74): "The passion for inflicting harm, the cruel thirst for vengeance, an unpacific and relentless spirit, the fever of
revolt, the lust of power, and such like things, all these are rightly condemned in war."</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>II-II.42.1: WHETHER SEDITION IS A SPECIAL SIN DISTINCT
FROM OTHER SINS?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> Sedition is a special sin, having something in common with war and strife, and differing somewhat
from them. It has something in common with them, in so far as it implies a certain antagonism, and it differs from
them in two points. <EM>First</EM>, <STRONG>because</STRONG> war and strife denote actual aggression on either side, whereas sedition may be
said to denote either actual aggression, or the preparation for such aggression. <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> a gloss on 2 Cor. 12:20 says
that "seditions are tumults tending to fight," when, to wit, a number of people make preparations with the intention
of fighting. <EM>Secondly</EM>, they differ in that war is, properly speaking, carried on against external foes, being as it were
between one people and another, whereas strife is between one individual and another, or between few people on
one side and few on the other side, while sedition, in its proper sense, is between mutually dissentient parts of one
people, as when one part of the state rises in tumult against another part. Wherefore, <STRONG>since</STRONG> sedition is opposed to a
special kind of good, namely the unity and peace of a people, it is a special kind of sin.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>II-II.42.2: WHETHER SEDITION IS ALWAYS A MORTAL SIN?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 1: It would seem that sedition is not always a mortal sin. For sedition denotes "a tumult tending to fight,"
according to the gloss quoted above (A1). But fighting is not always a mortal sin, indeed it is sometimes just and
lawful, as stated above (Q40, A1). Much more, therefore, can sedition be without a mortal sin.</P>

<P>OBJ 2: Further, sedition is a kind of discord, as stated above (A1, ad 3). Now discord can be without mortal sin,
and sometimes without any sin at all. Therefore sedition can be also.</P>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, it is praiseworthy to deliver a multitude from a tyrannical rule. Yet this cannot easily be done
without some dissension in the multitude, if one part of the multitude seeks to retain the tyrant, while the rest strive
to dethrone him. Therefore there can be sedition without mortal sin.</P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> As stated above (A1, ad 2), sedition is contrary to the unity of the multitude, viz. the people of a city
or kingdom. Now Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ii, 21) that "wise men understand the word people to designate not
any crowd of persons, but the assembly of those who are united together in fellowship recognized by law and for
the common good." Wherefore it is evident that the unity to which sedition is opposed is the unity of law and
common good: whence it follows manifestly that sedition is opposed to justice and the common good. Therefore by
reason of its genus it is a mortal sin, and its gravity will be all the greater according as the common good which it
assails surpasses the private good which is assailed by strife.</P>

<P>Accordingly the sin of sedition is first and chiefly in its authors, who sin most grievously; and secondly it is in
those who are led by them to disturb the common good. Those, however, who defend the common good, and
withstand the seditious party, are not themselves seditious, even as neither is a man to be called quarrelsome
<STRONG>because</STRONG> he defends himself, as stated above (Q41, A1).</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 1: It is lawful to fight, provided it be for the common good, as stated above (Q40, A1). But sedition
runs counter to the common good of the multitude, so that it is always a mortal sin.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 2: Discord from what is not evidently good, may be without sin, but discord from what is evidently
good, cannot be without sin: and sedition is discord of this kind, for it is contrary to the unity of the multitude,
which is a manifest good.</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 3: A tyrannical government is not just, <STRONG>because</STRONG> it is directed, not to the common good, but to the
private good of the ruler, as the Philosopher states (Polit. iii, 5; Ethic. viii, 10). <STRONG>Consequently</STRONG> there is no sedition
in disturbing a government of this kind, unless indeed the tyrant's rule be disturbed so inordinately, that his subjects
suffer greater harm from the consequent disturbance than from the tyrant's government. Indeed it is the tyrant rather
that is guilty of sedition, <STRONG>since</STRONG> he encourages discord and sedition among his subjects, that he may lord over them
more securely; for this is tyranny, being conducive to the private good of the ruler, and to the injury of the
multitude.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>II-II.64.5: WHETHER SUICIDE IS EVER MORAL?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P>OBJ 2: Further, it is moral, for one who exercises public authority, to kill evil-doers. Now he who exercises public
authority is sometimes an evil-doer. Therefore he may morally kill himself.</P>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, it is morally permissible for one to suffer spontaneously a lesser danger in order to avoid a greater:
<STRONG>Thus</STRONG> it is moral for one to cut off a decayed limb even from oneself, so that one may save the whole body. Now
sometimes a man, by killing himself, avoids a greater evil, for example an unhappy life, or the shame of sin.
Therefore a man may kill himself.</P>

<P><EM>On the contrary</EM>, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei i, 20): "Hence it follows that the words 'Thou shalt not kill'refer to
the killing of a man---not another man; therefore, not even thyself. For he who kills himself, kills nothing else than
a man."</P>

<P><EM>I answer that</EM>, It is altogether immoral to kill oneself, for three reasons. <EM>First,</EM> <STRONG>because</STRONG> everything naturally loves
itself, the result being that everything naturally keeps itself in being, and resists corruptions so far as it can.
Wherefore suicide is contrary to the inclination of nature, and to charity whereby every man should love himself.
<STRONG>Hence</STRONG> suicide is always a mortal sin, as being contrary to the natural law and to charity.</P>

<P><EM>Secondly,</EM> <STRONG>because</STRONG> every part, as such, belongs to the whole. Now every man is part of the community, and so, as
such, he belongs to the community. <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> by killing himself he injures the community, as the Philosopher declares
(Ethic. v, 11).</P>

<P><EM>Thirdly</EM>, <STRONG>because</STRONG> life is God's gift to man, and is subject to His power, Who kills and makes to live. <STRONG>Hence</STRONG>
whoever takes his own life, sins against God, even as he who kills another's slave, sins against that slave's master,
and as he who usurps to himself judgment of a matter not entrusted to him. For it belongs to God alone to
pronounce sentence of death and life, according to Dt. 32:39, "I will kill and I will make to live."<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 2: One who exercises public authority may morally put to death an evil-doer, <STRONG>since</STRONG> he can pass
judgment on him. But no man is judge of himself. Wherefore it is not moral for one who exercises public authority
to put himself to death for any sin whatever: although he may morally commit himself to the judgment of others.<BR>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>Reply OBJ 3: Man is made master of himself through his free-will: wherefore he can morally dispose of himself as
to those matters which pertain to this life which is ruled by man's free-will. But the passage from this life to another
and happier one is subject not to man's free-will but to the power of God. <STRONG>Hence</STRONG> it is not moral for man to take his
own life that he may pass to a happier life, nor that he may escape any unhappiness whatsoever of the present life,
<STRONG>because</STRONG> the ultimate and most fearsome evil of this life is death, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. iii, 6). Therefore
to bring death upon oneself in order to escape the other afflictions of this life, is to adopt a greater evil in order to
avoid a lesser.</P>

<P>In like manner it is immoral to take one's own life on account of one's having committed a sin, both <STRONG>because</STRONG> by so
doing one does oneself a very great injury, by depriving oneself of the time needful for repentance, and <STRONG>because</STRONG> it
is not moral to slay an evildoer except by the sentence of the public authority.</P>

<P>Again it is immoral for a woman to kill herself lest she be violated, <STRONG>because</STRONG> she ought not to commit on herself the
very great sin of suicide, to avoid the lesser sin; of another. For she commits no sin in being violated by force,
provided she does not consent, <STRONG>since</STRONG> "without consent of the mind there is no stain on the body," as the Blessed
Lucy declared. Now it is evident that fornication and adultery are less grievous sins than taking a man's, especially
one's own, life: <STRONG>since</STRONG> the latter is most grievous, <STRONG>because</STRONG> one injures oneself, to whom one owes the greatest love.
Moreover it is most dangerous <STRONG>since</STRONG> no time is left wherein to expiate it by repentance.</P>

<P>Again it is not moral for anyone to take his own life for fear he should consent to sin, <STRONG>because</STRONG> "evil must not be
done that good may come" (Rm. 3:8) or that evil may be avoided especially if the evil be of small account and an
uncertain event, for it is uncertain whether one will at some future time consent to a sin, <STRONG>since</STRONG> God is able to
deliver man from sin under any temptation whatever.</P>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>II-II.64.7: WHETHER IT IS MORAL TO KILL A MAN IN
SELF-DEFENSE?</STRONG></FONT> </P>

<P><EM>I answer that,</EM> Nothing hinders one act from having two effects, only one of which is intended, while the other is
beside the intention. Now moral acts take their species according to what is intended, and not according to what is
beside the intention, <STRONG>since</STRONG> this is accidental as explained above (Q43, A3; FS, Q12, A1). Accordingly the act of
self-defense may have two effects, one is the saving of one's life, the other is the slaying of the aggressor. Therefore
this act, <STRONG>since</STRONG> one's intention is to save one's own life, is not immoral, seeing that it is natural to everything to keep
itself in "being," as far as possible. And yet, though proceeding from a good intention, an act may be rendered
immoral, if it be out of proportion to the end. Wherefore if a man, in self-defense, uses more than necessary
violence, it will be immoral: whereas if he repel force with moderation his defense will be moral, <STRONG>because</STRONG>
according to the jurists [*Cap. Significasti, De Homicid. volunt. vel casual.], "it is moral to repel force by force,
provided one does not exceed the limits of a blameless defense." Nor is it necessary for salvation that a man omit
the act of moderate self-defense in order to avoid killing the other man, <STRONG>since</STRONG> one is bound to take more care of
one's own life than of another's. But as it is immoral to take a man's life, except for the public authority acting for
the common good, as stated above (A3), it is not moral for a man to intend killing a man in self-defense, except for
such as have public authority, who while intending to kill a man in self-defense, refer this to the public good, as in
the case of a soldier fighting against the foe, and in the minister of the judge struggling with robbers, although even
these sin if they be moved by private animosity.</P>
