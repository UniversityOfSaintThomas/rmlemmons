<P>And now let us proceed, he said. And first of all let me be sure that
I have in my mind what you were saying. Simmias, if I remember rightly,
has fears and misgivings whether the soul, being in the form of harmony,
although a fairer and diviner thing than the body, may not perish first.
On the other hand, Cebes appeared to grant that the soul was more lasting
than the body, but he said that no one could know whether the soul, after
having worn out many bodies, might not perish herself and leave her last
body behind her; and that this is death, which is the destruction not of
the body but of the soul, for in the body the work of destruction is ever
going on. Are not these, Simmias and Cebes, the points which we have to
consider?

<P>They both agreed to this statement of them. He proceeded: And did you
deny the force of the whole preceding argument, or of a part only?

<P>Of a part only, they replied. And what did you think, he said, of that
part of the argument in which we said that knowledge was recollection only,
and inferred from this that the soul must have previously existed somewhere
else before she was enclosed in the body? Cebes said that he had been wonderfully
impressed by that part of the argument, and that his conviction remained
unshaken. Simmias agreed, and added that he himself could hardly imagine
the possibility of his ever thinking differently about that.

<P>But, rejoined Socrates, you will have to think differently, my Theban
friend, if you still maintain that harmony is a compound, and that the
soul is a harmony which is made out of strings set in the frame of the
body; for you will surely never allow yourself to say that a harmony is
prior to the elements which compose the harmony.

<P>No, Socrates, that is impossible. But do you not see that you are saying
this when you say that the soul existed before she took the form and body
of man, and was made up of elements which as yet had no existence? For
harmony is not a sort of thing like the soul, as you suppose; but first
the lyre, and the strings, and the sounds exist in a state of discord,
and then harmony is made last of all, and perishes first. And how can such
a notion of the soul as this agree with the other?

<P>[19]

<P>Not at all, replied Simmias. And yet, he said, there surely ought to
be harmony when harmony is the theme of discourse.

<P>There ought, replied Simmias. But there is no harmony, he said, in the
two propositions that knowledge is recollection, and that the soul is a
harmony. Which of them, then, will you retain?

<P>I think, he replied, that I have a much stronger faith, Socrates, in
the first of the two, which has been fully demonstrated to me, than in
the latter, which has not been demonstrated at all, but rests only on probable
and plausible grounds; and I know too well that these arguments from probabilities
are impostors, and unless great caution is observed in the use of them
they are apt to be deceptive-in geometry, and in other things too. But
the doctrine of knowledge and recollection has been proven to me on trustworthy
grounds; and the proof was that the soul must have existed before she came
into the body, because to her belongs the essence of which the very name
implies existence. Having, as I am convinced, rightly accepted this conclusion,
and on sufficient grounds, I must, as I suppose, cease to argue or allow
others to argue that the soul is a harmony.

<P>Let me put the matter, Simmias, he said, in another point of view: Do
you imagine that a harmony or any other composition can be in a state other
than that of the elements out of which it is compounded?

<P>Certainly not. Or do or suffer anything other than they do or suffer?
He agreed. Then a harmony does not lead the parts or elements which make
up the harmony, but only follows them.

<P>He assented. For harmony cannot possibly have any motion, or sound,
or other quality which is opposed to the parts.

<P>That would be impossible, he replied. And does not every harmony depend
upon the manner in which the elements are harmonized?

<P>I do not understand you, he said. I mean to say that a harmony admits
of degrees, and is more of a harmony, and more completely a harmony, when
more completely harmonized, if that be possible; and less of a harmony,
and less completely a harmony, when less harmonized.

<P>True. But does the soul admit of degrees? or is one soul in the very
least degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?

<P>Not in the least. Yet surely one soul is said to have intelligence and
virtue, and to be good, and another soul is said to have folly and vice,
and to be an evil soul: and this is said truly?

<P>Yes, truly. But what will those who maintain the soul to be a harmony
say of this presence of virtue and vice in the soul?-Will they say that
there is another harmony, and another discord, and that the virtuous soul
is harmonized, and herself being a harmony has another harmony within her,
and that the vicious soul is inharmonical and has no harmony within her?

<P>I cannot say, replied Simmias; but I suppose that something of that
kind would be asserted by those who take this view.

<P>And the admission is already made that no soul is more a soul than another;
and this is equivalent to admitting that harmony is not more or less harmony,
or more or less completely a harmony?

<P>Quite true. And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more
or less harmonized?

<P>True. And that which is not more or less harmonized cannot have more
or less of harmony, but only an equal harmony?

<P>Yes, an equal harmony. Then one soul not being more or less absolutely
a soul than another, is not more or less harmonized?

<P>[20]

<P>Exactly. And therefore has neither more nor less of harmony or of discord?
She has not. And having neither more nor less of harmony or of discord,
one soul has no more vice or virtue than another, if vice be discord and
virtue harmony?

<P>Not at all more. Or speaking more correctly, Simmias, the soul, if she
is a harmony, will never have any vice; because a harmony, being absolutely
a harmony, has no part in the inharmonical?

<P>No. And therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has no vice? How
can she have, consistently with the preceding argument? Then, according
to this, if the souls of all animals are equally and absolutely souls,
they will be equally good?

<P>I agree with you, Socrates, he said. And can all this be true, think
you? he said; and are all these consequences admissible-which nevertheless
seem to follow from the assumption that the soul is a harmony?

<P>Certainly not, he said. Once more, he said, what ruling principle is
there of human things other than the soul, and especially the wise soul?
Do you know of any?

<P>Indeed, I do not. And is the soul in agreement with the affections of
the body? or is she at variance with them? For example, when the body is
hot and thirsty, does not the soul incline us against drinking? and when
the body is hungry, against eating? And this is only one instance out of
ten thousand of the opposition of the soul to the things of the body.

<P>Very true. But we have already acknowledged that the soul, being a harmony,
can never utter a note at variance with the tensions and relaxations and
vibrations and other affections of the strings out of which she is composed;
she can only follow, she cannot lead them?

<P>Yes, he said, we acknowledged that, certainly. And yet do we not now
discover the soul to be doing the exact opposite-leading the elements of
which she is believed to be composed; almost always opposing and coercing
them in all sorts of ways throughout life, sometimes more violently with
the pains of medicine and gymnastic; then again more gently; threatening
and also reprimanding the desires, passions, fears, as if talking to a
thing which is not herself, as Homer in the "Odyssey" represents Odysseus
doing in the words,

<P>"He beat his breast, and thus reproached his heart: Endure, my heart;
far worse hast thou endured!" Do you think that Homer could have written
this under the idea that the soul is a harmony capable of being led by
the affections of the body, and not rather of a nature which leads and
masters them; and herself a far diviner thing than any harmony?

<P>Yes, Socrates, I quite agree to that. Then, my friend, we can never
be right in saying that the soul is a harmony, for that would clearly contradict
the divine Homer as well as ourselves.

<P>True, he said. Thus much, said Socrates, of Harmonia, your Theban goddess,
Cebes, who has not been ungracious to us, I think; but what shall I say
to the Theban Cadmus, and how shall I propitiate him?

<P>I think that you will discover a way of propitiating him, said Cebes;
I am sure that you have answered the argument about harmony in a manner
that I could never have expected. For when Simmias mentioned his objection,
I quite imagined that no answer could be given to him, and therefore I
was surprised at finding that his argument could not sustain the first
onset of yours; and not impossibly the other, whom you call Cadmus, may
share a similar fate.

<P>Nay, my good friend, said Socrates, let us not boast, lest some evil
eye should put to flight the word which I am about to speak. That, however,
may be left in the hands of those above, while I draw near in Homeric fashion,
and try the mettle of your words. Briefly, the sum of your objection is
as follows: You want to have proven to you that the soul is imperishable
and immortal, and you think that the philosopher who is confident in death
has but a vain and foolish confidence, if he thinks that he will fare better
than one who has led another sort of life, in the world below, unless he
can prove this; and you say that the demonstration of the strength and
divinity of the soul, and of her existence prior to our becoming men, does
not necessarily imply her immortality. Granting that the soul is longlived,
and has known and done much in a former state, still she is not on that
account immortal; and her entrance into the human form may be a sort of
disease which is the beginning of dissolution, and may at last, after the
toils of life are over, end in that which is called death. And whether
the soul enters into the body once only or many times, that, as you would
say, makes no difference in the fears of individuals. For any man, who
is not devoid of natural feeling, has reason to fear, if he has no knowledge
or proof of the soul's immortality. That is what I suppose you to say,
Cebes, which I designedly repeat, in order that nothing may escape us,
and that you may, if you wish, add or subtract anything.

<P>[21]

<P>But, said Cebes, as far as I can see at present, I have nothing to add
or subtract; you have expressed my meaning.

<P>Socrates paused awhile, and seemed to be absorbed in reflection. At
length he said: This is a very serious inquiry which you are raising, Cebes,
involving the whole question of generation and corruption, about which
I will, if you like, give you my own experience; and you can apply this,
if you think that anything which I say will avail towards the solution
of your difficulty.

<P>I should very much like, said Cebes, to hear what you have to say. Then
I will tell you, said Socrates. When I was young, Cebes, I had a prodigious
desire to know that department of philosophy which is called Natural Science;
this appeared to me to have lofty aims, as being the science which has
to do with the causes of things, and which teaches why a thing is, and
is created and destroyed; and I was always agitating myself with the consideration
of such questions as these: Is the growth of animals the result of some
decay which the hot and cold principle contracts, as some have said? Is
the blood the element with which we think, or the air, or the fire? or
perhaps nothing of this sort-but the brain may be the originating power
of the perceptions of hearing and sight and smell, and memory and opinion
may come from them, and science may be based on memory and opinion when
no longer in motion, but at rest. And then I went on to examine the decay
of them, and then to the things of heaven and earth, and at last I concluded
that I was wholly incapable of these inquiries, as I will satisfactorily
prove to you. For I was fascinated by them to such a degree that my eyes
grew blind to things that I had seemed to myself, and also to others, to
know quite well; and I forgot what I had before thought to be self-evident,
that the growth of man is the result of eating and drinking; for when by
the digestion of food flesh is added to flesh and bone to bone, and whenever
there is an aggregation of congenial elements, the lesser bulk becomes
larger and the small man greater. Was not that a reasonable notion?

<P>Yes, said Cebes, I think so. Well; but let me tell you something more.
There was a time when I thought that I understood the meaning of greater
and less pretty well; and when I saw a great man standing by a little one
I fancied that one was taller than the other by a head; or one horse would
appear to be greater than another horse: and still more clearly did I seem
to perceive that ten is two more than eight, and that two cubits are more
than one, because two is twice one.

<P>And what is now your notion of such matters? said Cebes. I should be
far enough from imagining, he replied, that I knew the cause of any of
them, indeed I should, for I cannot satisfy myself that when one is added
to one, the one to which the addition is made becomes two, or that the
two units added together make two by reason of the addition. For I cannot
understand how, when separated from the other, each of them was one and
not two, and now, when they are brought together, the mere juxtaposition
of them can be the cause of their becoming two: nor can I understand how
the division of one is the way to make two; for then a different cause
would produce the same effect-as in the former instance the addition and
juxtaposition of one to one was the cause of two, in this the separation
and subtraction of one from the other would be the cause. Nor am I any
longer satisfied that I understand the reason why one or anything else
either is generated or destroyed or is at all, but I have in my mind some
confused notion of another method, and can never admit this.

<P>Then I heard someone who had a book of Anaxagoras, as he said, out of
which he read that mind was the disposer and cause of all, and I was quite
delighted at the notion of this, which appeared admirable, and I said to
myself: If mind is the disposer, mind will dispose all for the best, and
put each particular in the best place; and I argued that if anyone desired
to find out the cause of the generation or destruction or existence of
anything, he must find out what state of being or suffering or doing was
best for that thing, and therefore a man had only to consider the best
for himself and others, and then he would also know the worse, for that
the same science comprised both. And I rejoiced to think that I had found
in Anaxagoras a teacher of the causes of existence such as I desired, and
I imagined that he would tell me first whether the earth is flat or round;
and then he would further explain the cause and the necessity of this,
and would teach me the nature of the best and show that this was best;
and if he said that the earth was in the centre, he would explain that
this position was the best, and I should be satisfied if this were shown
to me, and not want any other sort of cause. And I thought that I would
then go and ask him about the sun and moon and stars, and that he would
explain to me their comparative swiftness, and their returnings and various
states, and how their several affections, active and passive, were all
for the best. For I could not imagine that when he spoke of mind as the
disposer of them, he would give any other account of their being as they
are, except that this was best; and I thought when he had explained to
me in detail the cause of each and the cause of all, he would go on to
explain to me what was best for each and what was best for all. I had hopes
which I would not have sold for much, and I seized the books and read them
as fast as I could in my eagerness to know the better and the worse.

<P>[22]

<P>What hopes I had formed, and how grievously was I disappointed! As I
proceeded, I found my philosopher altogether forsaking mind or any other
principle of order, but having recourse to air, and ether, and water, and
other eccentricities. I might compare him to a person who began by maintaining
generally that mind is the cause of the actions of Socrates, but who, when
he endeavored to explain the causes of my several actions in detail, went
on to show that I sit here because my body is made up of bones and muscles;
and the bones, as he would say, are hard and have ligaments which divide
them, and the muscles are elastic, and they cover the bones, which have
also a covering or environment of flesh and skin which contains them; and
as the bones are lifted at their joints by the contraction or relaxation
of the muscles, I am able to bend my limbs, and this is why I am sitting
here in a curved posture: that is what he would say, and he would have
a similar explanation of my talking to you, which he would attribute to
sound, and air, and hearing, and he would assign ten thousand other causes
of the same sort, forgetting to mention the true cause, which is that the
Athenians have thought fit to condemn me, and accordingly I have thought
it better and more right to remain here and undergo my sentence; for I
am inclined to think that these muscles and bones of mine would have gone
off to Megara or Boeotia-by the dog of Egypt they would, if they had been
guided only by their own idea of what was best, and if I had not chosen
as the better and nobler part, instead of playing truant and running away,
to undergo any punishment which the State inflicts. There is surely a strange
confusion of causes and conditions in all this. It may be said, indeed,
that without bones and muscles and the other parts of the body I cannot
execute my purposes. But to say that I do as I do because of them, and
that this is the way in which mind acts, and not from the choice of the
best, is a very careless and idle mode of speaking. I wonder that they
cannot distinguish the cause from the condition, which the many, feeling
about in the dark, are always mistaking and misnaming. And thus one man
makes a vortex all round and steadies the earth by the heaven; another
gives the air as a support to the earth, which is a sort of broad trough.
Any power which in disposing them as they are disposes them for the best
never enters into their minds, nor do they imagine that there is any superhuman
strength in that; they rather expect to find another Atlas of the world
who is stronger and more everlasting and more containing than the good
is, and are clearly of opinion that the obligatory and containing power
of the good is as nothing; and yet this is the principle which I would
fain learn if anyone would teach me. But as I have failed either to discover
myself or to learn of anyone else, the nature of the best, I will exhibit
to you, if you like, what I have found to be the second best mode of inquiring
into the cause.

<P>I should very much like to hear that, he replied. Socrates proceeded:
I thought that as I had failed in the contemplation of true existence,
I ought to be careful that I did not lose the eye of my soul; as people
may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing on the sun during an
eclipse, unless they take the precaution of only looking at the image reflected
in the water, or in some similar medium. That occurred to me, and I was
afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether if I looked at things with
my eyes or tried by the help of the senses to apprehend them. And I thought
that I had better have recourse to ideas, and seek in them the truth of
existence. I dare say that the simile is not perfect-for I am very far
from admitting that he who contemplates existence through the medium of
ideas, sees them only "through a glass darkly," any more than he who sees
them in their working and effects. However, this was the method which I
adopted: I first assumed some principle which I judged to be the strongest,
and then I affirmed as true whatever seemed to agree with this, whether
relating to the cause or to anything else; and that which disagreed I regarded
as untrue. But I should like to explain my meaning clearly, as I do not
think that you understand me.

<P>No, indeed, replied Cebes, not very well. There is nothing new, he said,
in what I am about to tell you; but only what I have been always and everywhere
repeating in the previous discussion and on other occasions: I want to
show you the nature of that cause which has occupied my thoughts, and I
shall have to go back to those familiar words which are in the mouth of
everyone, and first of all assume that there is an absolute beauty and
goodness and greatness, and the like; grant me this, and I hope to be able
to show you the nature of the cause, and to prove the immortality of the
soul.

<P>Cebes said: You may proceed at once with the proof, as I readily grant
you this.

<P>[23]

<P>Well, he said, then I should like to know whether you agree with me
in the next step; for I cannot help thinking that if there be anything
beautiful other than absolute beauty, that can only be beautiful in as
far as it partakes of absolute beauty-and this I should say of everything.
Do you agree in this notion of the cause?

<P>Yes, he said, I agree. He proceeded: I know nothing and can understand
nothing of any other of those wise causes which are alleged; and if a person
says to me that the bloom of color, or form, or anything else of that sort
is a source of beauty, I leave all that, which is only confusing to me,
and simply and singly, and perhaps foolishly, hold and am assured in my
own mind that nothing makes a thing beautiful but the presence and participation
of beauty in whatever way or manner obtained; for as to the manner I am
uncertain, but I stoutly contend that by beauty all beautiful things become
beautiful. That appears to me to be the only safe answer that I can give,
either to myself or to any other, and to that I cling, in the persuasion
that I shall never be overthrown, and that I may safely answer to myself
or any other that by beauty beautiful things become beautiful. Do you not
agree to that?

<P>Yes, I agree. And that by greatness only great things become great and
greater greater, and by smallness the less becomes less.

<P>True. Then if a person remarks that A is taller by a head than B, and
B less by a head than A, you would refuse to admit this, and would stoutly
contend that what you mean is only that the greater is greater by, and
by reason of, greatness, and the less is less only by, or by reason of,
smallness; and thus you would avoid the danger of saying that the greater
is greater and the less by the measure of the head, which is the same in
both, and would also avoid the monstrous absurdity of supposing that the
greater man is greater by reason of the head, which is small. Would you
not be afraid of that?

<P>Indeed, I should, said Cebes, laughing. In like manner you would be
afraid to say that ten exceeded eight by, and by reason of, two; but would
say by, and by reason of, number; or that two cubits exceed one cubit not
by a half, but by magnitude?-that is what you would say, for there is the
same danger in both cases.

<P>Very true, he said. Again, would you not be cautious of affirming that
the addition of one to one, or the division of one, is the cause of two?
And you would loudly asseverate that you know of no way in which anything
comes into existence except by participation in its own proper essence,
and consequently, as far as you know, the only cause of two is the participation
in duality; that is the way to make two, and the participation in one is
the way to make one. You would say: I will let alone puzzles of division
and addition-wiser heads than mine may answer them; inexperienced as I
am, and ready to start, as the proverb says, at my own shadow, I cannot
afford to give up the sure ground of a principle. And if anyone assails
you there, you would not mind him, or answer him until you had seen whether
the consequences which follow agree with one another or not, and when you
are further required to give an explanation of this principle, you would
go on to assume a higher principle, and the best of the higher ones, until
you found a resting-place; but you would not refuse the principle and the
consequences in your reasoning like the Eristics-at least if you wanted
to discover real existence. Not that this confusion signifies to them who
never care or think about the matter at all, for they have the wit to be
well pleased with themselves, however great may be the turmoil of their
ideas. But you, if you are a philosopher, will, I believe, do as I say.

<P>What you say is most true, said Simmias and Cebes, both speaking at
once.

<P>Ech. Yes, Phaedo; and I don't wonder at their assenting. Anyone who
has the least sense will acknowledge the wonderful clear. of Socrates'
reasoning.

<P>Phaed. Certainly, Echecrates; and that was the feeling of the whole
company at the time.

<P>Ech. Yes, and equally of ourselves, who were not of the company, and
are now listening to your recital. But what followed?

<P>[24]

<P>Phaedo. After all this was admitted, and they had agreed about the existence
of ideas and the participation in them of the other things which derive
their names from them, Socrates, if I remember rightly, said:-

<P>This is your way of speaking; and yet when you say that Simmias is greater
than Socrates and less than Phaedo, do you not predicate of Simmias both
greatness and smallness?

<P>Yes, I do. But still you allow that Simmias does not really exceed Socrates,
as the words may seem to imply, because he is Simmias, but by reason of
the size which he has; just as Simmias does not exceed Socrates because
he is Simmias, any more than because Socrates is Socrates, but because
he has smallness when compared with the greatness of Simmias?

<P>True. And if Phaedo exceeds him in size, that is not because Phaedo
is Phaedo, but because Phaedo has greatness relatively to Simmias, who
is comparatively smaller?

<P>That is true. And therefore Simmias is said to be great, and is also
said to be small, because he is in a mean between them, exceeding the smallness
of the one by his greatness, and allowing the greatness of the other to
exceed his smallness. He added, laughing, I am speaking like a book, but
I believe that what I am now saying is true.

<P>Simmias assented to this. The reason why I say this is that I want you
to agree with me in thinking, not only that absolute greatness will never
be great and also small, but that greatness in us or in the concrete will
never admit the small or admit of being exceeded: instead of this, one
of two things will happen-either the greater will fly or retire before
the opposite, which is the less, or at the advance of the less will cease
to exist; but will not, if allowing or admitting smallness, be changed
by that; even as I, having received and admitted smallness when compared
with Simmias, remain just as I was, and am the same small person. And as
the idea of greatness cannot condescend ever to be or become small, in
like manner the smallness in us cannot be or become great; nor can any
other opposite which remains the same ever be or become its own opposite,
but either passes away or perishes in the change.

<P>That, replied Cebes, is quite my notion. One of the company, though
I do not exactly remember which of them, on hearing this, said: By Heaven,
is not this the direct contrary of what was admitted before-that out of
the greater came the less and out of the less the greater, and that opposites
are simply generated from opposites; whereas now this seems to be utterly
denied.

<P>Socrates inclined his head to the speaker and listened. I like your
courage, he said, in reminding us of this. But you do not observe that
there is a difference in the two cases. For then we were speaking of opposites
in the concrete, and now of the essential opposite which, as is affirmed,
neither in us nor in nature can ever be at variance with itself: then,
my friend, we were speaking of things in which opposites are inherent and
which are called after them, but now about the opposites which are inherent
in them and which give their name to them; these essential opposites will
never, as we maintain, admit of generation into or out of one another.
At the same time, turning to Cebes, he said: Were you at all disconcerted,
Cebes, at our friend's objection?

<P>That was not my feeling, said Cebes; and yet I cannot deny that I am
apt to be disconcerted.

<P>Then we are agreed after all, said Socrates, that the opposite will
never in any case be opposed to itself?

<P>To that we are quite agreed, he replied. Yet once more let me ask you
to consider the question from another point of view, and see whether you
agree with me: There is a thing which you term heat, and another thing
which you term cold?

<P>Certainly. But are they the same as fire and snow? Most assuredly not.
Heat is not the same as fire, nor is cold the same as snow? No. And yet
you will surely admit that when snow, as before said, is under the influence
of heat, they will not remain snow and heat; but at the advance of the
heat the snow will either retire or perish?

<P>Very true, he replied. And the fire too at the advance of the cold will
either retire or perish; and when the fire is under the influence of the
cold, they will not remain, as before, fire and cold.

<P>[25]

<P>That is true, he said. And in some cases the name of the idea is not
confined to the idea; but anything else which, not being the idea, exists
only in the form of the idea, may also lay claim to it. I will try to make
this clearer by an example: The odd number is always called by the name
of odd?

<P>Very true. But is this the only thing which is called odd? Are there
not other things which have their own name, and yet are called odd, because,
although not the same as oddness, they are never without oddness?-that
is what I mean to ask-whether numbers such as the number three are not
of the class of odd. And there are many other examples: would you not say,
for example, that three may be called by its proper name, and also be called
odd, which is not the same with three? and this may be said not only of
three but also of five, and every alternate number-each of them without
being oddness is odd, and in the same way two and four, and the whole series
of alternate numbers, has every number even, without being evenness. Do
you admit that?

<P>Yes, he said, how can I deny that? Then now mark the point at which
I am aiming: not only do essential opposites exclude one another, but also
concrete things, which, although not in themselves opposed, contain opposites;
these, I say, also reject the idea which is opposed to that which is contained
in them, and at the advance of that they either perish or withdraw. There
is the number three for example; will not that endure annihilation or anything
sooner than be converted into an even number, remaining three?

<P>Very true, said Cebes. And yet, he said, the number two is certainly
not opposed to the number three?

<P>It is not. Then not only do opposite ideas repel the advance of one
another, but also there are other things which repel the approach of opposites.

<P>That is quite true, he said. Suppose, he said, that we endeavor, if
possible, to determine what these are.

<P>By all means. Are they not, Cebes, such as compel the things of which
they have possession, not only to take their own form, but also the form
of some opposite?

<P>What do you mean? I mean, as I was just now saying, and have no need
to repeat to you, that those things which are possessed by the number three
must not only be three in number, but must also be odd.

<P>Quite true. And on this oddness, of which the number three has the impress,
the opposite idea will never intrude?

<P>No. And this impress was given by the odd principle? Yes. And to the
odd is opposed the even? True. Then the idea of the even number will never
arrive at three? No. Then three has no part in the even? None. Then the
triad or number three is uneven? Very true. To return then to my distinction
of natures which are not opposites, and yet do not admit opposites: as,
in this instance, three, although not opposed to the even, does not any
the more admit of the even, but always brings the opposite into play on
the other side; or as two does not receive the odd, or fire the cold-from
these examples (and there are many more of them) perhaps you may be able
to arrive at the general conclusion that not only opposites will not receive
opposites, but also that nothing which brings the opposite will admit the
opposite of that which it brings in that to which it is brought. And here
let me recapitulate-for there is no harm in repetition. The number five
will not admit the nature of the even, any more than ten, which is the
double of five, will admit the nature of the odd-the double, though not
strictly opposed to the odd, rejects the odd altogether. Nor again will
parts in the ratio of 3:2, nor any fraction in which there is a half, nor
again in which there is a third, admit the notion of the whole, although
they are not opposed to the whole. You will agree to that?

<P>Yes, he said, I entirely agree and go along with you in that. And now,
he said, I think that I may begin again; and to the question which I am
about to ask I will beg you to give not the old safe answer, but another,
of which I will offer you an example; and I hope that you will find in
what has been just said another foundation which is as safe. I mean that
if anyone asks you "what that is, the inherence of which makes the body
hot," you will reply not heat (this is what I call the safe and stupid
answer), but fire, a far better answer, which we are now in a condition
to give. Or if anyone asks you "why a body is diseased," you will not say
from disease, but from fever; and instead of saying that oddness is the
cause of odd numbers, you will say that the monad is the cause of them:
and so of things in general, as I dare say that you will understand sufficiently
without my adducing any further examples.

<P>[26]

<P>Yes, he said, I quite understand you. Tell me, then, what is that the
inherence of which will render the body alive?

<P>The soul, he replied. And is this always the case? Yes, he said, of
course. Then whatever the soul possesses, to that she comes bearing life?
Yes, certainly. And is there any opposite to life? There is, he said. And
what is that? Death. Then the soul, as has been acknowledged, will never
receive the opposite of what she brings. And now, he said, what did we
call that principle which repels the even?

<P>The odd. And that principle which repels the musical, or the just? The
unmusical, he said, and the unjust. And what do we call the principle which
does not admit of death? The immortal, he said. And does the soul admit
of death? No. Then the soul is immortal? Yes, he said. And may we say that
this is proven? Yes, abundantly proven, Socrates, he replied. And supposing
that the odd were imperishable, must not three be imperishable?

<P>Of course. And if that which is cold were imperishable, when the warm
principle came attacking the snow, must not the snow have retired whole
and unmelted-for it could never have perished, nor could it have remained
and admitted the heat?

<P>True, he said. Again, if the uncooling or warm principle were imperishable,
the fire when assailed by cold would not have perished or have been extinguished,
but would have gone away unaffected?

<P>Certainly, he said. And the same may be said of the immortal: if the
immortal is also imperishable, the soul when attacked by death cannot perish;
for the preceding argument shows that the soul will not admit of death,
or ever be dead, any more than three or the odd number will admit of the
even, or fire or the heat in the fire, of the cold. Yet a person may say:
"But although the odd will not become even at the approach of the even,
why may not the odd perish and the even take the place of the odd?" Now
to him who makes this objection, we cannot answer that the odd principle
is imperishable; for this has not been acknowledged, but if this had been
acknowledged, there would have been no difficulty in contending that at
the approach of the even the odd principle and the number three took up
their departure; and the same argument would have held good of fire and
heat and any other thing.

<P>Very true. And the same may be said of the immortal: if the immortal
is also imperishable, then the soul will be imperishable as well as immortal;
but if not, some other proof of her imperishableness will have to be given.

<P>No other proof is needed, he said; for if the immortal, being eternal,
is liable to perish, then nothing is imperishable.

<P>Yes, replied Socrates, all men will agree that God, and the essential
form of life, and the immortal in general, will never perish.

<P>Yes, all men, he said-that is true; and what is more, gods, if I am
not mistaken, as well as men.

<P>Seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must not the soul,
if she is immortal, be also imperishable?

<P>Most certainly. Then when death attacks a man, the mortal portion of
him may be supposed to die, but the immortal goes out of the way of death
and is preserved safe and sound?

<P>True. Then, Cebes, beyond question the soul is immortal and imperishable,
and our souls will truly exist in another world!

<P>I am convinced, Socrates, said Cebes, and have nothing more to object;
but if my friend Simmias, or anyone else, has any further objection, he
had better speak out, and not keep silence, since I do not know how there
can ever be a more fitting time to which he can defer the discussion, if
there is anything which he wants to say or have said.

<P>But I have nothing more to say, replied Simmias; nor do I see any room
for uncertainty, except that which arises necessarily out of the greatness
of the subject and the feebleness of man, and which I cannot help feeling.

<P>[27]

<P>Yes, Simmias, replied Socrates, that is well said: and more than that,
first principles, even if they appear certain, should be carefully considered;
and when they are satisfactorily ascertained, then, with a sort of hesitating
confidence in human reason, you may, I think, follow the course of the
argument; and if this is clear, there will be no need for any further inquiry.

<P>That, he said, is true. But then, O my friends, he said, if the soul
is really immortal, what care should be taken of her, not only in respect
of the portion of time which is called life, but of eternity! And the danger
of neglecting her from this point of view does indeed appear to be awful.
If death had only been the end of all, the wicked would have had a good
bargain in dying, for they would have been happily quit not only of their
body, but of their own evil together with their souls. But now, as the
soul plainly appears to be immortal, there is no release or salvation from
evil except the attainment of the highest virtue and wisdom. For the soul
when on her progress to the world below takes nothing with her but nurture
and education; which are indeed said greatly to benefit or greatly to injure
the departed, at the very beginning of its pilgrimage in the other world.

<P>For after death, as they say, the genius of each individual, to whom
he belonged in life, leads him to a certain place in which the dead are
gathered together for judgment, whence they go into the world below, following
the guide who is appointed to conduct them from this world to the other:
and when they have there received their due and remained their time, another
guide brings them back again after many revolutions of ages. Now this journey
to the other world is not, as Aeschylus says in the "Telephus," a single
and straight path-no guide would be wanted for that, and no one could miss
a single path; but there are many partings of the road, and windings, as
I must infer from the rites and sacrifices which are offered to the gods
below in places where three ways meet on earth. The wise and orderly soul
is conscious of her situation and follows in the path; but the soul which
desires the body, and which, as I was relating before, has long been fluttering
about the lifeless frame and the world of sight, is after many struggles
and many sufferings hardly and with violence carried away by her attendant
genius, and when she arrives at the place where the other souls are gathered,
if she be impure and have done impure deeds, or been concerned in foul
murders or other crimes which are the brothers of these, and the works
of brothers in crime-from that soul everyone flees and turns away; no one
will be her companion, no one her guide, but alone she wanders in extremity
of evil until certain times are fulfilled, and when they are fulfilled,
she is borne irresistibly to her own fitting habitation; as every pure
and just soul which has passed through life in the company and under the
guidance of the gods has also her own proper home.

<P>Now the earth has divers wonderful regions, and is indeed in nature
and extent very unlike the notions of geographers, as I believe on the
authority of one who shall be nameless.

<P>What do you mean, Socrates? said Simmias. I have myself heard many descriptions
of the earth, but I do not know in what you are putting your faith, and
I should like to know.

<P>Well, Simmias, replied Socrates, the recital of a tale does not, I think,
require the art of Glaucus; and I know not that the art of Glaucus could
prove the truth of my tale, which I myself should never be able to prove,
and even if I could, I fear, Simmias, that my life would come to an end
before the argument was completed. I may describe to you, however, the
form and regions of the earth according to my conception of them.

<P>That, said Simmias, will be enough. Well, then, he said, my conviction
is that the earth is a round body in the center of the heavens, and therefore
has no need of air or any similar force as a support, but is kept there
and hindered from falling or inclining any way by the equability of the
surrounding heaven and by her own equipoise. For that which, being in equipoise,
is in the center of that which is equably diffused, will not incline any
way in any degree, but will always remain in the same state and not deviate.
And this is my first notion.

<P>Which is surely a correct one, said Simmias. Also I believe that the
earth is very vast, and that we who dwell in the region extending from
the river Phasis to the Pillars of Heracles, along the borders of the sea,
are just like ants or frogs about a marsh, and inhabit a small portion
only, and that many others dwell in many like places. For I should say
that in all parts of the earth there are hollows of various forms and sizes,
into which the water and the mist and the air collect; and that the true
earth is pure and in the pure heaven, in which also are the stars-that
is the heaven which is commonly spoken of as the ether, of which this is
but the sediment collecting in the hollows of the earth. But we who live
in these hollows are deceived into the notion that we are dwelling above
on the surface of the earth; which is just as if a creature who was at
the bottom of the sea were to fancy that he was on the surface of the water,
and that the sea was the heaven through which he saw the sun and the other
stars-he having never come to the surface by reason of his feebleness and
sluggishness, and having never lifted up his head and seen, nor ever heard
from one who had seen, this region which is so much purer and fairer than
his own. Now this is exactly our case: for we are dwelling in a hollow
of the earth, and fancy that we are on the surface; and the air we call
the heaven, and in this we imagine that the stars move. But this is also
owing to our feebleness and sluggishness, which prevent our reaching the
surface of the air: for if any man could arrive at the exterior limit,
or take the wings of a bird and fly upward, like a fish who puts his head
out and sees this world, he would see a world beyond; and, if the nature
of man could sustain the sight, he would acknowledge that this was the
place of the true heaven and the true light and the true stars. For this
earth, and the stones, and the entire region which surrounds us, are spoilt
and corroded, like the things in the sea which are corroded by the brine;
for in the sea too there is hardly any noble or perfect growth, but clefts
only, and sand, and an endless slough of mud: and even the shore is not
to be compared to the fairer sights of this world. And greater far is the
superiority of the other. Now of that upper earth which is under the heaven,
I can tell you a charming tale, Simmias, which is well worth hearing.

<P>And we, Socrates, replied Simmias, shall be charmed to listen. The tale,
my friend, he said, is as follows: In the first place, the earth, when
looked at from above, is like one of those balls which have leather coverings
in twelve pieces, and is of divers colors, of which the colors which painters
use on earth are only a sample. But there the whole earth is made up of
them, and they are brighter far and clearer than ours; there is a purple
of wonderful luster, also the radiance of gold, and the white which is
in the earth is whiter than any chalk or snow. Of these and other colors
the earth is made up, and they are more in number and fairer than the eye
of man has ever seen; and the very hollows (of which I was speaking) filled
with air and water are seen like light flashing amid the other colors,
and have a color of their own, which gives a sort of unity to the variety
of earth. And in this fair region everything that grows-trees, and flowers,
and fruits-is in a like degree fairer than any here; and there are hills,
and stones in them in a like degree smoother, and more transparent, and
fairer in color than our highly valued emeralds and sardonyxes and jaspers,
and other gems, which are but minute fragments of them: for there all the
stones are like our precious stones, and fairer still. The reason of this
is that they are pure, and not, like our precious stones, infected or corroded
by the corrupt briny elements which coagulate among us, and which breed
foulness and disease both in earth and stones, as well as in animals and
plants. They are the jewels of the upper earth, which also shines with
gold and silver and the like, and they are visible to sight and large and
abundant and found in every region of the earth, and blessed is he who
sees them. And upon the earth are animals and men, some in a middle region,
others dwelling about the air as we dwell about the sea; others in islands
which the air flows round, near the continent: and in a word, the air is
used by them as the water and the sea are by us, and the ether is to them
what the air is to us. Moreover, the temperament of their seasons is such
that they have no disease, and live much longer than we do, and have sight
and hearing and smell, and all the other senses, in far greater perfection,
in the same degree that air is purer than water or the ether than air.
Also they have temples and sacred places in which the gods really dwell,
and they hear their voices and receive their answers, and are conscious
of them and hold converse with them, and they see the sun, moon, and stars
as they really are, and their other blessedness is of a piece with this.

<P>[28]

<P>Such is the nature of the whole earth, and of the things which are around
the earth; and there are divers regions in the hollows on the face of the
globe everywhere, some of them deeper and also wider than that which we
inhabit, others deeper and with a narrower opening than ours, and some
are shallower and wider; all have numerous perforations, and passages broad
and narrow in the interior of the earth, connecting them with one another;
and there flows into and out of them, as into basins, a vast tide of water,
and huge subterranean streams of perennial rivers, and springs hot and
cold, and a great fire, and great rivers of fire, and streams of liquid
mud, thin or thick (like the rivers of mud in Sicily, and the lava-streams
which follow them), and the regions about which they happen to flow are
filled up with them. And there is a sort of swing in the interior of the
earth which moves all this up and down. Now the swing is in this wise:
There is a chasm which is the vastest of them all, and pierces right through
the whole earth; this is that which Homer describes in the words,

<P>"Far off, where is the inmost depth beneath the earth"; and which he
in other places, and many other poets, have called Tartarus. And the swing
is caused by the streams flowing into and out of this chasm, and they each
have the nature of the soil through which they flow. And the reason why
the streams are always flowing in and out is that the watery element has
no bed or bottom, and is surging and swinging up and down, and the surrounding
wind and air do the same; they follow the water up and down, hither and
thither, over the earth-just as in respiring the air is always in process
of inhalation and exhalation; and the wind swinging with the water in and
out produces fearful and irresistible blasts: when the waters retire with
a rush into the lower parts of the earth, as they are called, they flow
through the earth into those regions, and fill them up as with the alternate
motion of a pump, and then when they leave those regions and rush back
hither, they again fill the hollows here, and when these are filled, flow
through subterranean channels and find their way to their several places,
forming seas, and lakes, and rivers, and springs. Thence they again enter
the earth, some of them making a long circuit into many lands, others going
to few places and those not distant, and again fall into Tartarus, some
at a point a good deal lower than that at which they rose, and others not
much lower, but all in some degree lower than the point of issue. And some
burst forth again on the opposite side, and some on the same side, and
some wind round the earth with one or many folds, like the coils of a serpent,
and descend as far as they can, but always return and fall into the lake.
The rivers on either side can descend only to the center and no further,
for to the rivers on both sides the opposite side is a precipice.

<P>Now these rivers are many, and mighty, and diverse, and there are four
principal ones, of which the greatest and outermost is that called Oceanus,
which flows round the earth in a circle; and in the opposite direction
flows Acheron, which passes under the earth through desert places, into
the Acherusian Lake: this is the lake to the shores of which the souls
of the many go when they are dead, and after waiting an appointed time,
which is to some a longer and to some a shorter time, they are sent back
again to be born as animals. The third river rises between the two, and
near the place of rising pours into a vast region of fire, and forms a
lake larger than the Mediterranean Sea, boiling with water and mud; and
proceeding muddy and turbid, and winding about the earth, comes, among
other places, to the extremities of the Acherusian Lake, but mingles not
with the waters of the lake, and after making many coils about the earth
plunges into Tartarus at a deeper level. This is that Pyriphlegethon, as
the stream is called, which throws up jets of fire in all sorts of places.
The fourth river goes out on the opposite side, and falls first of all
into a wild and savage region, which is all of a dark-blue color, like
lapis lazuli; and this is that river which is called the Stygian River,
and falls into and forms the Lake Styx, and after falling into the lake
and receiving strange powers in the waters, passes under the earth, winding
round in the opposite direction to Pyriphlegethon, and meeting in the Acherusian
Lake from the opposite side. And the water of this river too mingles with
no other, but flows round in a circle and falls into Tartarus over against
Pyriphlegethon, and the name of this river, as the poet says, is Cocytus.

<P>Such is the name of the other world; and when the dead arrive at the
place to which the genius of each severally conveys them, first of all
they have sentence passed upon them, as they have lived well and piously
or not. And those who appear to have lived neither well nor ill, go to
the river Acheron, and mount such conveyances as they can get, and are
carried in them to the lake, and there they dwell and are purified of their
evil deeds, and suffer the penalty of the wrongs which they have done to
others, and are absolved, and receive the rewards of their good deeds according
to their deserts. But those who appear to be incurable by reason of the
greatness of their crimes-who have committed many and terrible deeds of
sacrilege, murders foul and violent, or the like-such are hurled into Tartarus,
which is their suitable destiny, and they never come out. Those again who
have committed crimes, which, although great, are not unpardonable-who
in a moment of anger, for example, have done violence to a father or mother,
and have repented for the remainder of their lives, or who have taken the
life of another under like extenuating circumstances-these are plunged
into Tartarus, the pains of which they are compelled to undergo for a year,
but at the end of the year the wave casts them forth-mere homicides by
way of Cocytus, parricides and matricides by Pyriphlegethon-and they are
borne to the Acherusian Lake, and there they lift up their voices and call
upon the victims whom they have slain or wronged, to have pity on them,
and to receive them, and to let them come out of the river into the lake.
And if they prevail, then they come forth and cease from their troubles;
but if not, they are carried back again into Tartarus and from thence into
the rivers unceasingly, until they obtain mercy from those whom they have
wronged: for that is the sentence inflicted upon them by their judges.
Those also who are remarkable for having led holy lives are released from
this earthly prison, and go to their pure home which is above, and dwell
in the purer earth; and those who have duly purified themselves with philosophy
live henceforth altogether without the body, in mansions fairer far than
these, which may not be described, and of which the time would fail me
to tell.

<P>[29]

<P>Wherefore, Simmias, seeing all these things, what ought not we to do
in order to obtain virtue and wisdom in this life? Fair is the prize, and
the hope great.

<P>I do not mean to affirm that the description which I have given of the
soul and her mansions is exactly true-a man of sense ought hardly to say
that. But I do say that, inasmuch as the soul is shown to be immortal,
he may venture to think, not improperly or unworthily, that something of
the kind is true. The venture is a glorious one, and he ought to comfort
himself with words like these, which is the reason why lengthen out the
tale. Wherefore, I say, let a man be of good cheer about his soul, who
has cast away the pleasures and ornaments of the body as alien to him,
and rather hurtful in their effects, and has followed after the pleasures
of knowledge in this life; who has adorned the soul in her own proper jewels,
which are temperance, and justice, and courage, and nobility, and truth-in
these arrayed she is ready to go on her journey to the world below, when
her time comes. You, Simmias and Cebes, and all other men, will depart
at some time or other. Me already, as the tragic poet would say, the voice
of fate calls. Soon I must drink the poison; and I think that I had better
repair to the bath first, in order that the women may not have the trouble
of washing my body after I am dead.

<P>When he had done speaking, Crito said: And have you any commands for
us, Socrates-anything to say about your children, or any other matter in
which we can serve you?

<P>Nothing particular, he said: only, as I have always told you, I would
have you look to yourselves; that is a service which you may always be
doing to me and mine as well as to yourselves. And you need not make professions;
for if you take no thought for yourselves, and walk not according to the
precepts which I have given you, not now for the first time, the warmth
of your professions will be of no avail.

<P>We will do our best, said Crito. But in what way would you have us bury
you?

<P>In any way that you like; only you must get hold of me, and take care
that I do not walk away from you. Then he turned to us, and added with
a smile: I cannot make Crito believe that I am the same Socrates who have
been talking and conducting the argument; he fancies that I am the other
Socrates whom he will soon see, a dead body-and he asks, How shall he bury
me? And though I have spoken many words in the endeavor to show that when
I have drunk the poison I shall leave you and go to the joys of the blessed-these
words of mine, with which I comforted you and myself, have had, I perceive,
no effect upon Crito. And therefore I want you to be surety for me now,
as he was surety for me at the trial: but let the promise be of another
sort; for he was my surety to the judges that I would remain, but you must
be my surety to him that I shall not remain, but go away and depart; and
then he will suffer less at my death, and not be grieved when he sees my
body being burned or buried. I would not have him sorrow at my hard lot,
or say at the burial, Thus we lay out Socrates, or, Thus we follow him
to the grave or bury him; for false words are not only evil in themselves,
but they infect the soul with evil. Be of good cheer, then, my dear Crito,
and say that you are burying my body only, and do with that as is usual,
and as you think best.

<P>When he had spoken these words, he arose and went into the bath chamber
with Crito, who bade us wait; and we waited, talking and thinking of the
subject of discourse, and also of the greatness of our sorrow; he was like
a father of whom we were being bereaved, and we were about to pass the
rest of our lives as orphans. When he had taken the bath his children were
brought to him-(he had two young sons and an elder one); and the women
of his family also came, and he talked to them and gave them a few directions
in the presence of Crito; and he then dismissed them and returned to us.

<P>[30]

<P>Now the hour of sunset was near, for a good deal of time had passed
while he was within. When he came out, he sat down with us again after
his bath, but not much was said. Soon the jailer, who was the servant of
the Eleven, entered and stood by him, saying: To you, Socrates, whom I
know to be the noblest and gentlest and best of all who ever came to this
place, I will not impute the angry feelings of other men, who rage and
swear at me when, in obedience to the authorities, I bid them drink the
poison-indeed, I am sure that you will not be angry with me; for others,
as you are aware, and not I, are the guilty cause. And so fare you well,
and try to bear lightly what must needs be; you know my errand. Then bursting
into tears he turned away and went out.

<P>Socrates looked at him and said: I return your good wishes, and will
do as you bid. Then, turning to us, he said, How charming the man is: since
I have been in prison he has always been coming to see me, and at times
he would talk to me, and was as good as could be to me, and now see how
generously he sorrows for me. But we must do as he says, Crito; let the
cup be brought, if the poison is prepared: if not, let the attendant prepare
some.

<P>Yet, said Crito, the sun is still upon the hilltops, and many a one
has taken the draught late, and after the announcement has been made to
him, he has eaten and drunk, and indulged in sensual delights; do not hasten
then, there is still time.

<P>Socrates said: Yes, Crito, and they of whom you speak are right in doing
thus, for they think that they will gain by the delay; but I am right in
not doing thus, for I do not think that I should gain anything by drinking
the poison a little later; I should be sparing and saving a life which
is already gone: I could only laugh at myself for this. Please then to
do as I say, and not to refuse me.

<P>Crito, when he heard this, made a sign to the servant, and the servant
went in, and remained for some time, and then returned with the jailer
carrying a cup of poison. Socrates said: You, my good friend, who are experienced
in these matters, shall give me directions how I am to proceed. The man
answered: You have only to walk about until your legs are heavy, and then
to lie down, and the poison will act. At the same time he handed the cup
to Socrates, who in the easiest and gentlest manner, without the least
fear or change of color or feature, looking at the man with all his eyes,
Echecrates, as his manner was, took the cup and said: What do you say about
making a libation out of this cup to any god? May I, or not? The man answered:
We only prepare, Socrates, just so much as we deem enough. I understand,
he said: yet I may and must pray to the gods to prosper my journey from
this to that other world-may this, then, which is my prayer, be granted
to me. Then holding the cup to his lips, quite readily and cheerfully he
drank off the poison. And hitherto most of us had been able to control
our sorrow; but now when we saw him drinking, and saw too that he had finished
the draught, we could no longer forbear, and in spite of myself my own
tears were flowing fast; so that I covered my face and wept over myself,
for certainly I was not weeping over him, but at the thought of my own
calamity in having lost such a companion. Nor was I the first, for Crito,
when he found himself unable to restrain his tears, had got up and moved
away, and I followed; and at that moment. Apollodorus, who had been weeping
all the time, broke out in a loud cry which made cowards of us all. Socrates
alone retained his calmness: What is this strange outcry? he said. I sent
away the women mainly in order that they might not offend in this way,
for I have heard that a man should die in peace. Be quiet, then, and have
patience.

<P>When we heard that, we were ashamed, and refrained our tears; and he
walked about until, as he said, his legs began to fail, and then he lay
on his back, according to the directions, and the man who gave him the
poison now and then looked at his feet and legs; and after a while he pressed
his foot hard and asked him if he could feel; and he said, no; and then
his leg, and so upwards and upwards, and showed us that he was cold and

set, and Crito closed his eyes and mouth.
