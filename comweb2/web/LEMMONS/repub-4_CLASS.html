&nbsp;

<P>.... SOCRATES&nbsp;<A NAME="11"></A>
<BR>And so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed&nbsp;<A NAME="984"></A>that
the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the individual,&nbsp;<A NAME="985"></A>and
that they are three in number.&nbsp;<A NAME="986"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="987"></A>
<BR>Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way,&nbsp;<A NAME="988"></A>and
in virtue of the same quality which makes the State&nbsp;<A NAME="989"></A>wise?&nbsp;<A NAME="990"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="991"></A>
<BR>Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State constitutes&nbsp;<A NAME="992"></A>courage
in the individual, and that both the State and the individual bear&nbsp;<A NAME="993"></A>the
same relation to all the other virtues?&nbsp;<A NAME="994"></A>

<P>Assuredly.&nbsp;<A NAME="995"></A>
<BR>And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same&nbsp;<A NAME="996"></A>way
in which the State is just?&nbsp;<A NAME="997"></A>

<P>That follows, of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="998"></A>
<BR>We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each&nbsp;<A NAME="999"></A>of
the three classes doing the work of its own class?&nbsp;<A NAME="1000"></A>

<P>We are not very likely to have forgotten, he&nbsp;<A NAME="1001"></A>said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1002"></A>
<BR>We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities&nbsp;<A NAME="1003"></A>of
his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own&nbsp;<A NAME="1004"></A>work?&nbsp;<A NAME="1005"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, we must remember that too.&nbsp;<A NAME="1006"></A>
<BR>And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care&nbsp;<A NAME="1007"></A>of
the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to&nbsp;<A NAME="1008"></A>be
the subject and ally?&nbsp;<A NAME="1009"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1010"></A>
<BR>And, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic&nbsp;<A NAME="1011"></A>will
bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble&nbsp;<A NAME="1012"></A>words
and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness&nbsp;<A NAME="1013"></A>of
passion by harmony and rhythm?&nbsp;<A NAME="1014"></A>

<P>Quite true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1015"></A>
<BR>And these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly&nbsp;<A NAME="1016"></A>to
know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in&nbsp;<A NAME="1017"></A>each
of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable&nbsp;<A NAME="1018"></A>of
gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong&nbsp;<A NAME="1019"></A>with
the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the concupiscent&nbsp;<A NAME="1020"></A>soul,
no longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave and&nbsp;<A NAME="1021"></A>rule
those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn the whole&nbsp;<A NAME="1022"></A>life
of man?&nbsp;<A NAME="1023"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1024"></A>
<BR>Both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul&nbsp;<A NAME="1025"></A>and
the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1026"></A>the
other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his commands&nbsp;<A NAME="1027"></A>and
counsels?&nbsp;<A NAME="1028"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1029"></A>
<BR>And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure&nbsp;<A NAME="1030"></A>and
in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to&nbsp;<A NAME="1031"></A>fear?&nbsp;<A NAME="1032"></A>

<P>Right, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1033"></A>
<BR>And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1034"></A>which
proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a&nbsp;<A NAME="1035"></A>knowledge
of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of&nbsp;<A NAME="1036"></A>the
whole?&nbsp;<A NAME="1037"></A>

<P>Assuredly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1038"></A>
<BR>And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements&nbsp;<A NAME="1039"></A>in
friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the&nbsp;<A NAME="1040"></A>two
subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought&nbsp;<A NAME="1041"></A>to
rule, and do not rebel?&nbsp;<A NAME="1042"></A>

<P>Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether&nbsp;<A NAME="1043"></A>in
the State or individual.&nbsp;<A NAME="1044"></A>

<P>And surely, I said, we have explained again and again how and by&nbsp;<A NAME="1045"></A>virtue
of what quality a man will be just.&nbsp;<A NAME="1046"></A>

<P>That is very certain.&nbsp;<A NAME="1047"></A>
<BR>And is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different,&nbsp;<A NAME="1048"></A>or
is she the same which we found her to be in the State?&nbsp;<A NAME="1049"></A>

<P>There is no difference in my opinion, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1050"></A>
<BR>Because, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few commonplace&nbsp;<A NAME="1051"></A>instances
will satisfy us of the truth of what I am&nbsp;<A NAME="1052"></A>saying.&nbsp;<A NAME="1053"></A>

<P>What sort of instances do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="1054"></A>
<BR>If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or&nbsp;<A NAME="1055"></A>the
man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less&nbsp;<A NAME="1056"></A>likely
than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver? Would&nbsp;<A NAME="1057"></A>any
one deny this?&nbsp;<A NAME="1058"></A>

<P>No one, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1059"></A>
<BR>Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft,&nbsp;<A NAME="1060"></A>or
treachery either to his friends or to his country?&nbsp;<A NAME="1061"></A>

<P>Never.&nbsp;<A NAME="1062"></A>
<BR>Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or&nbsp;<A NAME="1063"></A>agreements?&nbsp;<A NAME="1064"></A>

<P>Impossible.&nbsp;<A NAME="1065"></A>
<BR>No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his&nbsp;<A NAME="1066"></A>father
and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?&nbsp;<A NAME="1067"></A>

<P>No one.&nbsp;<A NAME="1068"></A>
<BR>And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,&nbsp;<A NAME="1069"></A>whether
in ruling or being ruled?&nbsp;<A NAME="1070"></A>

<P>Exactly so.&nbsp;<A NAME="1071"></A>
<BR>Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such&nbsp;<A NAME="1072"></A>states
is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?&nbsp;<A NAME="1073"></A>

<P>Not I, indeed.&nbsp;<A NAME="1074"></A>
<BR>Then our dream has been realised; and the suspicion which we entertained&nbsp;<A NAME="1075"></A>at
the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power must&nbsp;<A NAME="1076"></A>have
conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been&nbsp;<A NAME="1077"></A>verified?&nbsp;<A NAME="1078"></A>

<P>Yes, certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1079"></A>
<BR>And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker&nbsp;<A NAME="1080"></A>and
the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not&nbsp;<A NAME="1081"></A>another's,
was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was of&nbsp;<A NAME="1082"></A>use?&nbsp;<A NAME="1083"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1084"></A>
<BR>But in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned&nbsp;<A NAME="1085"></A>however,
not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the true&nbsp;<A NAME="1086"></A>self
and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit the several&nbsp;<A NAME="1087"></A>elements
within him to interfere with one another, or any of them to do&nbsp;<A NAME="1088"></A>the
work of others, --he sets in order his own inner life, and is his own&nbsp;<A NAME="1089"></A>master
and his own law, and at peace with himself; and when he has bound&nbsp;<A NAME="1090"></A>together
the three principles within him, which may be compared to the&nbsp;<A NAME="1091"></A>higher,
lower, and middle notes of the scale, and the intermediate intervals&nbsp;<A NAME="1092"></A>--when
he has bound all these together, and is no longer many, but has&nbsp;<A NAME="1093"></A>become
one entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature, then he proceeds&nbsp;<A NAME="1094"></A>to
act, if he has to act, whether in a matter of property, or in the treatment&nbsp;<A NAME="1095"></A>of
the body, or in some affair of politics or private business; always&nbsp;<A NAME="1096"></A>thinking
and calling that which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious&nbsp;<A NAME="1097"></A>condition,
just and good action, and the knowledge which presides over&nbsp;<A NAME="1098"></A>it,
wisdom, and that which at any time impairs this condition, he will&nbsp;<A NAME="1099"></A>call
unjust action, and the opinion which presides over it&nbsp;<A NAME="1100"></A>ignorance.&nbsp;<A NAME="1101"></A>

<P>You have said the exact truth, Socrates.&nbsp;<A NAME="1102"></A>
<BR>Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just&nbsp;<A NAME="1103"></A>man
and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should&nbsp;<A NAME="1104"></A>not
be telling a falsehood?&nbsp;<A NAME="1105"></A>

<P>Most certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="1106"></A>
<BR>May we say so, then?&nbsp;<A NAME="1107"></A>
<BR>Let us say so.&nbsp;<A NAME="1108"></A>
<BR>And now, I said, injustice has to be considered.&nbsp;<A NAME="1109"></A>
<BR>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1110"></A>
<BR>Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles&nbsp;<A NAME="1111"></A>--a
meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="1112"></A>against
the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is made by&nbsp;<A NAME="1113"></A>a
rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the natural vassal,&nbsp;<A NAME="1114"></A>--what
is all this confusion and delusion but injustice, and intemperance&nbsp;<A NAME="1115"></A>and
cowardice and ignorance, and every form of vice?&nbsp;<A NAME="1116"></A>

<P>Exactly so.&nbsp;<A NAME="1117"></A>
<BR>And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning&nbsp;<A NAME="1118"></A>of
acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will&nbsp;<A NAME="1119"></A>also
be perfectly clear?&nbsp;<A NAME="1120"></A>

<P>What do you mean? he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1121"></A>
<BR>Why, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just&nbsp;<A NAME="1122"></A>what
disease and health are in the body.&nbsp;<A NAME="1123"></A>

<P>How so? he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1124"></A>
<BR>Why, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is&nbsp;<A NAME="1125"></A>unhealthy
causes disease.&nbsp;<A NAME="1126"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="1127"></A>
<BR>And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause&nbsp;<A NAME="1128"></A>injustice?&nbsp;<A NAME="1129"></A>
<BR>That is certain.&nbsp;<A NAME="1130"></A>
<BR>And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and&nbsp;<A NAME="1131"></A>government
of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation&nbsp;<A NAME="1132"></A>of
disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this&nbsp;<A NAME="1133"></A>natural
order?&nbsp;<A NAME="1134"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1135"></A>
<BR>And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order&nbsp;<A NAME="1136"></A>and
government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation&nbsp;<A NAME="1137"></A>of
injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural&nbsp;<A NAME="1138"></A>order?&nbsp;<A NAME="1139"></A>

<P>Exactly so, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1140"></A>
<BR>Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1141"></A>vice
the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?&nbsp;<A NAME="1142"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1143"></A>
<BR>And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to&nbsp;<A NAME="1144"></A>vice?&nbsp;<A NAME="1145"></A>

<P>Assuredly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1146"></A>
<BR>Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and&nbsp;<A NAME="1147"></A>injustice
has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to be just&nbsp;<A NAME="1148"></A>and
act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of gods and&nbsp;<A NAME="1149"></A>men,
or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and&nbsp;<A NAME="1150"></A>unreformed?&nbsp;<A NAME="1151"></A>

<P>In my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous.&nbsp;<A NAME="1152"></A>We
know that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer endurable,&nbsp;<A NAME="1153"></A>though
pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and having all wealth&nbsp;<A NAME="1154"></A>and
all power; and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital&nbsp;<A NAME="1155"></A>principle
is undermined and corrupted, life is still worth having to a&nbsp;<A NAME="1156"></A>man,
if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception&nbsp;<A NAME="1157"></A>that
he is not to acquire justice and virtue, or to escape from injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="1158"></A>and
vice; assuming them both to be such as we have described?&nbsp;<A NAME="1159"></A>

<P>Yes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. Still, as&nbsp;<A NAME="1160"></A>we
are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner&nbsp;<A NAME="1161"></A>with
our own eyes, let us not faint by the way.&nbsp;<A NAME="1162"></A>

<P>Certainly not, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1163"></A>
<BR>Come up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, those&nbsp;<A NAME="1164"></A>of
them, I mean, which are worth looking at.&nbsp;<A NAME="1165"></A>

<P>I am following you, he replied: proceed.&nbsp;<A NAME="1166"></A>
<BR>I said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as&nbsp;<A NAME="1167"></A>from
some tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="1168"></A>is
one, but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four special&nbsp;<A NAME="1169"></A>ones
which are deserving of note.&nbsp;<A NAME="1170"></A>

<P>What do you mean? he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1171"></A>
<BR>I mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="1172"></A>as
there are distinct forms of the State.&nbsp;<A NAME="1173"></A>

<P>How many?&nbsp;<A NAME="1174"></A>
<BR>There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I&nbsp;<A NAME="1175"></A>said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1176"></A>
<BR>What are they?&nbsp;<A NAME="1177"></A>
<BR>The first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which&nbsp;<A NAME="1178"></A>may
be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as&nbsp;<A NAME="1179"></A>rule
is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.&nbsp;<A NAME="1180"></A>

<P>True, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="1181"></A>
<BR>But I regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether&nbsp;<A NAME="1182"></A>the
government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been&nbsp;<A NAME="1183"></A>trained
in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of the&nbsp;<A NAME="1184"></A>State
will be maintained.&nbsp;<A NAME="1185"></A>

<P>That is true, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="end"></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
