<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Reflect upon the following words of Shakespeare. Would
Shakespeare have reached the same conclusion if he did not
believe that the self continued to exist after death? </p>

<p>To be or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by
opposing end them? </p>

<p>To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end the
heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to,
'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. </p>

<p>To die, to sleep: To sleep; perchance to dream: ay, there's
the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we
have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause; </p>

<p>There's the respect that makes calamity of so long life; For
who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's
wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of despied love, the
law's delay, the insolence of office and the spurns that patient
merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus
make with a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, to grunt and
sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after
death, the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller
returns, puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we
have than fly to others that we know not of?</p>
