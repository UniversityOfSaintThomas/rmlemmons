<P><A NAME="start"></A><A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="11"></A>

<P>And so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the&nbsp;<A NAME="12"></A>perfect
State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education&nbsp;<A NAME="13"></A>and
the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best philosophers&nbsp;<A NAME="14"></A>and
the bravest warriors are to be their kings?&nbsp;<A NAME="15"></A>

<P>That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.&nbsp;<A NAME="16"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when&nbsp;<A NAME="17"></A>appointed
themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses&nbsp;<A NAME="18"></A>such
as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="19"></A>private,
or individual; and about their property, you remember what we&nbsp;<A NAME="20"></A>agreed?&nbsp;<A NAME="21"></A>

<P>Yes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions&nbsp;<A NAME="22"></A>of
mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving from&nbsp;<A NAME="23"></A>the
other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance,&nbsp;<A NAME="24"></A>and
they were to take care of themselves and of the whole&nbsp;<A NAME="25"></A>State.&nbsp;<A NAME="26"></A>

<P>True, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded,&nbsp;<A NAME="27"></A>let
us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the&nbsp;<A NAME="28"></A>old
path.&nbsp;<A NAME="29"></A>

<P>There is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now,&nbsp;<A NAME="30"></A>that
you had finished the description of the State: you said that such&nbsp;<A NAME="31"></A>a
State was good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although,&nbsp;<A NAME="32"></A>as
now appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of State and&nbsp;<A NAME="33"></A>man.
And you said further, that if this was the true form, then the others&nbsp;<A NAME="34"></A>were
false; and of the false forms, you said, as I remember, that there&nbsp;<A NAME="35"></A>were
four principal ones, and that their defects, and the defects of the&nbsp;<A NAME="36"></A>individuals
corresponding to them, were worth examining. When we had seen&nbsp;<A NAME="37"></A>all
the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was the best and who&nbsp;<A NAME="38"></A>was
the worst of them, we were to consider whether the best was not also&nbsp;<A NAME="39"></A>the
happiest, and the worst the most miserable. I asked you what were the&nbsp;<A NAME="40"></A>four
forms of government of which you spoke, and then Polemarchus and Adeimantus&nbsp;<A NAME="41"></A>put
in their word; and you began again, and have found your way to the&nbsp;<A NAME="42"></A>point
at which we have now arrived.&nbsp;<A NAME="43"></A>

<P>Your recollection, I said, is most exact.&nbsp;<A NAME="44"></A>
<BR>Then, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in the&nbsp;<A NAME="45"></A>same
position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me the&nbsp;<A NAME="46"></A>same
answer which you were about to give me then.&nbsp;<A NAME="47"></A>

<P>Yes, if I can, I will, I said.&nbsp;<A NAME="48"></A>
<BR>I shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions&nbsp;<A NAME="49"></A>of
which you were speaking.&nbsp;<A NAME="50"></A>

<P>That question, I said, is easily answered: the four governments&nbsp;<A NAME="51"></A>of
which I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those&nbsp;<A NAME="52"></A>of
Crete and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy&nbsp;<A NAME="53"></A>comes
next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of government which&nbsp;<A NAME="54"></A>teems
with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows oligarchy,&nbsp;<A NAME="55"></A>although
very different: and lastly comes tyranny, great and famous, which&nbsp;<A NAME="56"></A>differs
from them all, and is the fourth and worst disorder of a State.&nbsp;<A NAME="57"></A>I
do not know, do you? of any other constitution which can be said to have&nbsp;<A NAME="58"></A>a
distinct character. There are lordships and principalities which are&nbsp;<A NAME="59"></A>bought
and sold, and some other intermediate forms of government. But these&nbsp;<A NAME="60"></A>are
nondescripts and may be found equally among Hellenes and among&nbsp;<A NAME="61"></A>barbarians.&nbsp;<A NAME="62"></A>

<P>Yes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government&nbsp;<A NAME="63"></A>which
exist among them.&nbsp;<A NAME="64"></A>

<P>Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions&nbsp;<A NAME="65"></A>of
men vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of&nbsp;<A NAME="66"></A>the
other? For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,'&nbsp;<A NAME="67"></A>and
not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure&nbsp;<A NAME="68"></A>turn
the scale and draw other things after them?&nbsp;<A NAME="69"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human&nbsp;<A NAME="70"></A>characters.&nbsp;<A NAME="71"></A>

<P>Then if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions&nbsp;<A NAME="72"></A>of
individual minds will also be five?&nbsp;<A NAME="73"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="74"></A>
<BR>Him who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly call just and good,&nbsp;<A NAME="75"></A>we
have already described.&nbsp;<A NAME="76"></A>

<P>We have.&nbsp;<A NAME="77"></A>
<BR>Then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being&nbsp;<A NAME="78"></A>the
contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity; also the&nbsp;<A NAME="79"></A>oligarchical,
democratical, and tyrannical. Let us place the most just&nbsp;<A NAME="80"></A>by
the side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be able to&nbsp;<A NAME="81"></A>compare
the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of&nbsp;<A NAME="82"></A>pure
justice or pure injustice. The enquiry will then be completed. And&nbsp;<A NAME="83"></A>we
shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice, as Thrasymachus advises,&nbsp;<A NAME="84"></A>or
in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer&nbsp;<A NAME="85"></A>justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="86"></A>

<P>Certainly, he replied, we must do as you say.&nbsp;<A NAME="87"></A>
<BR>Shall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to clearness,&nbsp;<A NAME="88"></A>of
taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual, and begin&nbsp;<A NAME="89"></A>with
the government of honour? --I know of no name for such a government&nbsp;<A NAME="90"></A>other
than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We will compare with this the&nbsp;<A NAME="91"></A>like
character in the individual; and, after that, consider oligarchical&nbsp;<A NAME="92"></A>man;
and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical&nbsp;<A NAME="93"></A>man;
and lastly, we will go and view the city of tyranny, and once more&nbsp;<A NAME="94"></A>take
a look into the tyrant's soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory&nbsp;<A NAME="95"></A>decision.&nbsp;<A NAME="96"></A>

<P>That way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very&nbsp;<A NAME="97"></A>suitable.&nbsp;<A NAME="98"></A>
<BR>First, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government of&nbsp;<A NAME="99"></A>honour)
arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best). Clearly,&nbsp;<A NAME="100"></A>all
political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power;&nbsp;<A NAME="101"></A>a
government which is united, however small, cannot be&nbsp;<A NAME="102"></A>moved.&nbsp;<A NAME="103"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="104"></A>
<BR>In what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner the two&nbsp;<A NAME="105"></A>classes
of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one&nbsp;<A NAME="106"></A>another?
Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell us&nbsp;<A NAME="107"></A>'how
discord first arose'? Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery, to&nbsp;<A NAME="108"></A>play
and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a lofty&nbsp;<A NAME="109"></A>tragic
vein, making believe to be in earnest?&nbsp;<A NAME="110"></A>

<P>How would they address us?&nbsp;<A NAME="111"></A>
<BR>After this manner: --A city which is thus constituted can hardly be&nbsp;<A NAME="112"></A>shaken;
but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end,&nbsp;<A NAME="113"></A>even
a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will in time&nbsp;<A NAME="114"></A>be
dissolved. And this is the dissolution: --In plants that grow in the&nbsp;<A NAME="115"></A>earth,
as well as in animals that move on the earth's surface, fertility&nbsp;<A NAME="116"></A>and
sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles&nbsp;<A NAME="117"></A>of
each are completed, which in short-lived existences pass over a short&nbsp;<A NAME="118"></A>space,
and in long-lived ones over a long space. But to the knowledge of&nbsp;<A NAME="119"></A>human
fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers&nbsp;<A NAME="120"></A>will
not attain; the laws which regulate them will not be discovered by&nbsp;<A NAME="121"></A>an
intelligence which is alloyed with sense, but will escape them, and&nbsp;<A NAME="122"></A>they
will bring children into the world when they ought not. Now that which&nbsp;<A NAME="123"></A>is
of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number,&nbsp;<A NAME="124"></A>but
the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in which first&nbsp;<A NAME="125"></A>increments
by involution and evolution (or squared and cubed) obtaining&nbsp;<A NAME="126"></A>three
intervals and four terms of like and unlike, waxing and waning numbers,&nbsp;<A NAME="127"></A>make
all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another. The base&nbsp;<A NAME="128"></A>of
these (3) with a third added (4) when combined with five (20) and raised&nbsp;<A NAME="129"></A>to
the third power furnishes two harmonies; the first a square which is&nbsp;<A NAME="130"></A>a
hundred times as great (400 = 4 X 100), and the other a figure having&nbsp;<A NAME="131"></A>one
side equal to the former, but oblong, consisting of a hundred numbers&nbsp;<A NAME="132"></A>squared
upon rational diameters of a square (i. e. omitting fractions),&nbsp;<A NAME="133"></A>the
side of which is five (7 X 7 = 49 X 100 = 4900), each of them being&nbsp;<A NAME="134"></A>less
by one (than the perfect square which includes the fractions, sc.&nbsp;<A NAME="135"></A>50)
or less by two perfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square&nbsp;<A NAME="136"></A>the
side of which is five = 50 + 50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of three&nbsp;<A NAME="137"></A>(27
X 100 = 2700 + 4900 + 400 = 8000). Now this number represents a geometrical&nbsp;<A NAME="138"></A>figure
which has control over the good and evil of births. For when your&nbsp;<A NAME="139"></A>guardians
are ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and bridegroom&nbsp;<A NAME="140"></A>out
of season, the children will not be goodly or fortunate. And though&nbsp;<A NAME="141"></A>only
the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still they&nbsp;<A NAME="142"></A>will
be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they come into&nbsp;<A NAME="143"></A>power
as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in taking care of us,&nbsp;<A NAME="144"></A>the
Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect will soon extend&nbsp;<A NAME="145"></A>to
gymnastic; and hence the young men of your State will be less cultivated.&nbsp;<A NAME="146"></A>In
the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the&nbsp;<A NAME="147"></A>guardian
power of testing the metal of your different races, which, like&nbsp;<A NAME="148"></A>Hesiod's,
are of gold and silver and brass and iron. And so iron will be&nbsp;<A NAME="149"></A>mingled
with silver, and brass with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity&nbsp;<A NAME="150"></A>and
inequality and irregularity, which always and in all places are causes&nbsp;<A NAME="151"></A>of
hatred and war. This the Muses affirm to be the stock from which discord&nbsp;<A NAME="152"></A>has
sprung, wherever arising; and this is their answer to&nbsp;<A NAME="153"></A>us.&nbsp;<A NAME="154"></A>

<P>Yes, and we may assume that they answer truly.&nbsp;<A NAME="155"></A>
<BR>Why, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak&nbsp;<A NAME="156"></A>falsely?&nbsp;<A NAME="157"></A>

<P>And what do the Muses say next?&nbsp;<A NAME="158"></A>
<BR>When discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the&nbsp;<A NAME="159"></A>iron
and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and&nbsp;<A NAME="160"></A>silver;
but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the&nbsp;<A NAME="161"></A>true
riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient&nbsp;<A NAME="162"></A>order
of things. There was a battle between them, and at last they agreed&nbsp;<A NAME="163"></A>to
distribute their land and houses among individual owners; and they enslaved&nbsp;<A NAME="164"></A>their
friends and maintainers, whom they had formerly protected in the&nbsp;<A NAME="165"></A>condition
of freemen, and made of them subjects and servants; and they&nbsp;<A NAME="166"></A>themselves
were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against&nbsp;<A NAME="167"></A>them.&nbsp;<A NAME="168"></A>

<P>I believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the&nbsp;<A NAME="169"></A>change.&nbsp;<A NAME="170"></A>
<BR>And the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate&nbsp;<A NAME="171"></A>between
oligarchy and aristocracy?&nbsp;<A NAME="172"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="173"></A>
<BR>Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will&nbsp;<A NAME="174"></A>they
proceed? Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy&nbsp;<A NAME="175"></A>and
the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other, and&nbsp;<A NAME="176"></A>will
also have some peculiarities.&nbsp;<A NAME="177"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="178"></A>
<BR>In the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class&nbsp;<A NAME="179"></A>from
agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution&nbsp;<A NAME="180"></A>of
common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military training&nbsp;<A NAME="181"></A>--in
all these respects this State will resemble the&nbsp;<A NAME="182"></A>former.&nbsp;<A NAME="183"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="184"></A>
<BR>But in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are&nbsp;<A NAME="185"></A>no
longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;&nbsp;<A NAME="186"></A>and
in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who&nbsp;<A NAME="187"></A>are
by nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set by&nbsp;<A NAME="188"></A>them
upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of everlasting&nbsp;<A NAME="189"></A>wars
--this State will be for the most part peculiar.&nbsp;<A NAME="190"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="191"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like&nbsp;<A NAME="192"></A>those
who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing&nbsp;<A NAME="193"></A>after
gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having magazines&nbsp;<A NAME="194"></A>and
treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them; also&nbsp;<A NAME="195"></A>castles
which are just nests for their eggs, and in which they will spend&nbsp;<A NAME="196"></A>large
sums on their wives, or on any others whom they&nbsp;<A NAME="197"></A>please.&nbsp;<A NAME="198"></A>

<P>That is most true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="199"></A>
<BR>And they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring&nbsp;<A NAME="200"></A>the
money which they prize; they will spend that which is another man's&nbsp;<A NAME="201"></A>on
the gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and running&nbsp;<A NAME="202"></A>away
like children from the law, their father: they have been schooled&nbsp;<A NAME="203"></A>not
by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her who&nbsp;<A NAME="204"></A>is
the true Muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and have honoured&nbsp;<A NAME="205"></A>gymnastic
more than music.&nbsp;<A NAME="206"></A>

<P>Undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe&nbsp;<A NAME="207"></A>is
a mixture of good and evil.&nbsp;<A NAME="208"></A>

<P>Why, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing only,&nbsp;<A NAME="209"></A>is
predominantly seen, --the spirit of contention and ambition; and these&nbsp;<A NAME="210"></A>are
due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited&nbsp;<A NAME="211"></A>element.&nbsp;<A NAME="212"></A>

<P>Assuredly, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="213"></A>
<BR>Such is the origin and such the character of this State, which has&nbsp;<A NAME="214"></A>been
described in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required,&nbsp;<A NAME="215"></A>for
a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and&nbsp;<A NAME="216"></A>most
perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and all the characters&nbsp;<A NAME="217"></A>of
men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable&nbsp;<A NAME="218"></A>labour.&nbsp;<A NAME="219"></A>

<P>Very true, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="220"></A>
<BR>Now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into&nbsp;<A NAME="221"></A>being,
and what is he like?&nbsp;<A NAME="222"></A>

<P>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS&nbsp;<A NAME="223"></A>

<P>I think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which&nbsp;<A NAME="224"></A>characterises
him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.&nbsp;<A NAME="225"></A>

<P>Perhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there&nbsp;<A NAME="226"></A>are
other respects in which he is very different.&nbsp;<A NAME="227"></A>

<P>In what respects?&nbsp;<A NAME="228"></A>
<BR>He should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet&nbsp;<A NAME="229"></A>a
friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.&nbsp;<A NAME="230"></A>Such
a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man,&nbsp;<A NAME="231"></A>who
is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen, and&nbsp;<A NAME="232"></A>remarkably
obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a lover of&nbsp;<A NAME="233"></A>honour;
claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or on any ground&nbsp;<A NAME="234"></A>of
that sort, but because he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms;&nbsp;<A NAME="235"></A>he
is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the&nbsp;<A NAME="236"></A>chase.&nbsp;<A NAME="237"></A>

<P>Yes, that is the type of character which answers to&nbsp;<A NAME="238"></A>timocracy.&nbsp;<A NAME="239"></A>
<BR>Such an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets&nbsp;<A NAME="240"></A>older
he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a piece&nbsp;<A NAME="241"></A>of
the avaricious nature in him, and is not singleminded towards virtue,&nbsp;<A NAME="242"></A>having
lost his best guardian.&nbsp;<A NAME="243"></A>

<P>Who was that? said Adeimantus.&nbsp;<A NAME="244"></A>
<BR>Philosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes her abode&nbsp;<A NAME="245"></A>in
a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout&nbsp;<A NAME="246"></A>life.&nbsp;<A NAME="247"></A>

<P>Good, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="248"></A>
<BR>Such, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the timocratical&nbsp;<A NAME="249"></A>State.&nbsp;<A NAME="250"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="251"></A>
<BR>His origin is as follows: --He is often the young son of a grave father,&nbsp;<A NAME="252"></A>who
dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours and&nbsp;<A NAME="253"></A>offices,
and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but is ready&nbsp;<A NAME="254"></A>to
waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.&nbsp;<A NAME="255"></A>

<P>And how does the son come into being?&nbsp;<A NAME="256"></A>
<BR>The character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother&nbsp;<A NAME="257"></A>complaining
that her husband has no place in the government, of which the&nbsp;<A NAME="258"></A>consequence
is that she has no precedence among other women. Further, when&nbsp;<A NAME="259"></A>she
sees her husband not very eager about money, and instead of battling&nbsp;<A NAME="260"></A>and
railing in the law courts or assembly, taking whatever happens to him&nbsp;<A NAME="261"></A>quietly;
and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself,&nbsp;<A NAME="262"></A>while
he treats her with very considerable indifference, she is annoyed,&nbsp;<A NAME="263"></A>and
says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too easy-going:&nbsp;<A NAME="264"></A>adding
all the other complaints about her own ill-treatment which women&nbsp;<A NAME="265"></A>are
so fond of rehearsing.&nbsp;<A NAME="266"></A>

<P>Yes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints&nbsp;<A NAME="267"></A>are
so like themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="268"></A>

<P>And you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed&nbsp;<A NAME="269"></A>to
be attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same&nbsp;<A NAME="270"></A>strain
to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his father,&nbsp;<A NAME="271"></A>or
is wronging him in any way, and he falls to prosecute them, they tell&nbsp;<A NAME="272"></A>the
youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort,&nbsp;<A NAME="273"></A>and
be more of a man than his father. He has only to walk abroad and he&nbsp;<A NAME="274"></A>hears
and sees the same sort of thing: those who do their own business&nbsp;<A NAME="275"></A>in
the city are called simpletons, and held in no esteem, while the busy-bodies&nbsp;<A NAME="276"></A>are
honoured and applauded. The result is that the young man, hearing and&nbsp;<A NAME="277"></A>seeing
all these thing --hearing too, the words of his father, and having&nbsp;<A NAME="278"></A>a
nearer view of his way of life, and making comparisons of him and others&nbsp;<A NAME="279"></A>--is
drawn opposite ways: while his father is watering and nourishing the&nbsp;<A NAME="280"></A>rational
principle in his soul, the others are encouraging the passionate&nbsp;<A NAME="281"></A>and
appetitive; and he being not originally of a bad nature, but having&nbsp;<A NAME="282"></A>kept
bad company, is at last brought by their joint influence to a middle&nbsp;<A NAME="283"></A>point,
and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle&nbsp;<A NAME="284"></A>of
contentiousness and passion, and becomes arrogant and&nbsp;<A NAME="285"></A>ambitious.&nbsp;<A NAME="286"></A>

<P>You seem to me to have described his origin&nbsp;<A NAME="287"></A>perfectly.&nbsp;<A NAME="288"></A>
<BR>Then we have now, I said, the second form of government and the second&nbsp;<A NAME="289"></A>type
of character?&nbsp;<A NAME="290"></A>

<P>We have.&nbsp;<A NAME="291"></A>
<BR>Next, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus&nbsp;<A NAME="292"></A>says,&nbsp;<A NAME="293"></A>

<P>Is set over against another State; or rather, as our plan requires,&nbsp;<A NAME="294"></A>begin
with the State.&nbsp;<A NAME="295"></A>

<P>By all means.&nbsp;<A NAME="296"></A>
<BR>I believe that oligarchy follows next in order.&nbsp;<A NAME="297"></A>
<BR>And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?&nbsp;<A NAME="298"></A>
<BR>A government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich&nbsp;<A NAME="299"></A>have
power and the poor man is deprived of it.&nbsp;<A NAME="300"></A>

<P>I understand, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="301"></A>
<BR>Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to&nbsp;<A NAME="302"></A>oligarchy
arises?&nbsp;<A NAME="303"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="304"></A>
<BR>Well, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes&nbsp;<A NAME="305"></A>into
the other.&nbsp;<A NAME="306"></A>

<P>How?&nbsp;<A NAME="307"></A>
<BR>The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is&nbsp;<A NAME="308"></A>ruin
the of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what&nbsp;<A NAME="309"></A>do
they or their wives care about the law?&nbsp;<A NAME="310"></A>

<P>Yes, indeed.&nbsp;<A NAME="311"></A>
<BR>And then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and thus&nbsp;<A NAME="312"></A>the
great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.&nbsp;<A NAME="313"></A>

<P>Likely enough.&nbsp;<A NAME="314"></A>
<BR>And so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making&nbsp;<A NAME="315"></A>a
fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are&nbsp;<A NAME="316"></A>placed
together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as the&nbsp;<A NAME="317"></A>other
falls.&nbsp;<A NAME="318"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="319"></A>
<BR>And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State,&nbsp;<A NAME="320"></A>virtue
and the virtuous are dishonoured.&nbsp;<A NAME="321"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="322"></A>
<BR>And what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is&nbsp;<A NAME="323"></A>neglected.&nbsp;<A NAME="324"></A>

<P>That is obvious.&nbsp;<A NAME="325"></A>
<BR>And so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become&nbsp;<A NAME="326"></A>lovers
of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and&nbsp;<A NAME="327"></A>make
a ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.&nbsp;<A NAME="328"></A>

<P>They do so.&nbsp;<A NAME="329"></A>
<BR>They next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the qualification&nbsp;<A NAME="330"></A>of
citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower in another, as&nbsp;<A NAME="331"></A>the
oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow no one whose property&nbsp;<A NAME="332"></A>falls
below the amount fixed to have any share in the government. These&nbsp;<A NAME="333"></A>changes
in the constitution they effect by force of arms, if intimidation&nbsp;<A NAME="334"></A>has
not already done their work.&nbsp;<A NAME="335"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="336"></A>
<BR>And this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is&nbsp;<A NAME="337"></A>established.&nbsp;<A NAME="338"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of&nbsp;<A NAME="339"></A>government,
and what are the defects of which we were&nbsp;<A NAME="340"></A>speaking?&nbsp;<A NAME="341"></A>

<P>First of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification&nbsp;<A NAME="342"></A>just
think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their&nbsp;<A NAME="343"></A>property,
and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though&nbsp;<A NAME="344"></A>he
were a better pilot?&nbsp;<A NAME="345"></A>

<P>You mean that they would shipwreck?&nbsp;<A NAME="346"></A>
<BR>Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?&nbsp;<A NAME="347"></A>
<BR>I should imagine so.&nbsp;<A NAME="348"></A>
<BR>Except a city? --or would you include a city?&nbsp;<A NAME="349"></A>
<BR>Nay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch&nbsp;<A NAME="350"></A>as
the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of&nbsp;<A NAME="351"></A>all.&nbsp;<A NAME="352"></A>

<P>This, then, will be the first great defect of&nbsp;<A NAME="353"></A>oligarchy?&nbsp;<A NAME="354"></A>
<BR>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="355"></A>
<BR>And here is another defect which is quite as bad.&nbsp;<A NAME="356"></A>
<BR>What defect?&nbsp;<A NAME="357"></A>
<BR>The inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States, the&nbsp;<A NAME="358"></A>one
of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same spot&nbsp;<A NAME="359"></A>and
always conspiring against one another.&nbsp;<A NAME="360"></A>

<P>That, surely, is at least as bad.&nbsp;<A NAME="361"></A>
<BR>Another discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are&nbsp;<A NAME="362"></A>incapable
of carrying on any war. Either they arm the multitude, and then&nbsp;<A NAME="363"></A>they
are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not call&nbsp;<A NAME="364"></A>them
out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to fight&nbsp;<A NAME="365"></A>as
they are few to rule. And at the same time their fondness for money&nbsp;<A NAME="366"></A>makes
them unwilling to pay taxes.&nbsp;<A NAME="367"></A>

<P>How discreditable!&nbsp;<A NAME="368"></A>
<BR>And, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons&nbsp;<A NAME="369"></A>have
too many callings --they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all&nbsp;<A NAME="370"></A>in
one. Does that look well?&nbsp;<A NAME="371"></A>

<P>Anything but well.&nbsp;<A NAME="372"></A>
<BR>There is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and to&nbsp;<A NAME="373"></A>which
this State first begins to be liable.&nbsp;<A NAME="374"></A>

<P>What evil?&nbsp;<A NAME="375"></A>
<BR>A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property;&nbsp;<A NAME="376"></A>yet
after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a&nbsp;<A NAME="377"></A>part,
being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but&nbsp;<A NAME="378"></A>only
a poor, helpless creature.&nbsp;<A NAME="379"></A>

<P>Yes, that is an evil which also first begins in this&nbsp;<A NAME="380"></A>State.&nbsp;<A NAME="381"></A>
<BR>The evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both&nbsp;<A NAME="382"></A>the
extremes of great wealth and utter poverty.&nbsp;<A NAME="383"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="384"></A>
<BR>But think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money,&nbsp;<A NAME="385"></A>was
a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes of&nbsp;<A NAME="386"></A>citizenship?
Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body, although&nbsp;<A NAME="387"></A>in
truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a&nbsp;<A NAME="388"></A>spendthrift?&nbsp;<A NAME="389"></A>

<P>As you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a&nbsp;<A NAME="390"></A>spendthrift.&nbsp;<A NAME="391"></A>
<BR>May we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the&nbsp;<A NAME="392"></A>drone
in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as the&nbsp;<A NAME="393"></A>other
is of the hive?&nbsp;<A NAME="394"></A>

<P>Just so, Socrates.&nbsp;<A NAME="395"></A>
<BR>And God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings,&nbsp;<A NAME="396"></A>whereas
of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others&nbsp;<A NAME="397"></A>have
dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in their old&nbsp;<A NAME="398"></A>age
end as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal class, as they&nbsp;<A NAME="399"></A>are
termed.&nbsp;<A NAME="400"></A>

<P>Most true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="401"></A>
<BR>Clearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in that&nbsp;<A NAME="402"></A>neighborhood
there are hidden away thieves, and cutpurses and robbers of&nbsp;<A NAME="403"></A>temples,
and all sorts of malefactors.&nbsp;<A NAME="404"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="405"></A>
<BR>Well, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find&nbsp;<A NAME="406"></A>paupers?&nbsp;<A NAME="407"></A>
<BR>Yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a&nbsp;<A NAME="408"></A>ruler.&nbsp;<A NAME="409"></A>
<BR>And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals&nbsp;<A NAME="410"></A>to
be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are&nbsp;<A NAME="411"></A>careful
to restrain by force?&nbsp;<A NAME="412"></A>

<P>Certainly, we may be so bold.&nbsp;<A NAME="413"></A>
<BR>The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,&nbsp;<A NAME="414"></A>ill-training,
and an evil constitution of the State?&nbsp;<A NAME="415"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="416"></A>
<BR>Such, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there&nbsp;<A NAME="417"></A>may
be many other evils.&nbsp;<A NAME="418"></A>

<P>Very likely.&nbsp;<A NAME="419"></A>
<BR>Then oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are elected&nbsp;<A NAME="420"></A>for
their wealth, may now be dismissed. Let us next proceed to consider&nbsp;<A NAME="421"></A>the
nature and origin of the individual who answers to this&nbsp;<A NAME="422"></A>State.&nbsp;<A NAME="423"></A>

<P>By all means.&nbsp;<A NAME="424"></A>
<BR>Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this&nbsp;<A NAME="425"></A>wise?&nbsp;<A NAME="426"></A>

<P>How?&nbsp;<A NAME="427"></A>
<BR>A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first&nbsp;<A NAME="428"></A>he
begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but presently&nbsp;<A NAME="429"></A>he
sees him of a sudden foundering against the State as upon a sunken reef,&nbsp;<A NAME="430"></A>and
he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a general or some&nbsp;<A NAME="431"></A>other
high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by&nbsp;<A NAME="432"></A>informers,
and either put to death, or exiled, or deprived of the privileges&nbsp;<A NAME="433"></A>of
a citizen, and all his property taken from him.&nbsp;<A NAME="434"></A>

<P>Nothing more likely.&nbsp;<A NAME="435"></A>
<BR>And the son has seen and known all this --he is a ruined man, and his&nbsp;<A NAME="436"></A>fear
has taught him to knock ambition and passion head-foremost from his&nbsp;<A NAME="437"></A>bosom's
throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean&nbsp;<A NAME="438"></A>and
miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. Is not such&nbsp;<A NAME="439"></A>an
one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant&nbsp;<A NAME="440"></A>throne
and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt with tiara&nbsp;<A NAME="441"></A>and
chain and scimitar?&nbsp;<A NAME="442"></A>

<P>Most true, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="443"></A>
<BR>And when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently&nbsp;<A NAME="444"></A>on
either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know their place,&nbsp;<A NAME="445"></A>he
compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into&nbsp;<A NAME="446"></A>larger
ones, and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything&nbsp;<A NAME="447"></A>but
riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so much as the&nbsp;<A NAME="448"></A>acquisition
of wealth and the means of acquiring it.&nbsp;<A NAME="449"></A>

<P>Of all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as&nbsp;<A NAME="450"></A>the
conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious&nbsp;<A NAME="451"></A>one.&nbsp;<A NAME="452"></A>

<P>And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical&nbsp;<A NAME="453"></A>youth?&nbsp;<A NAME="454"></A>
<BR>Yes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like&nbsp;<A NAME="455"></A>the
State out of which oligarchy came.&nbsp;<A NAME="456"></A>

<P>Let us then consider whether there is any likeness between&nbsp;<A NAME="457"></A>them.&nbsp;<A NAME="458"></A>
<BR>Very good.&nbsp;<A NAME="459"></A>
<BR>First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set&nbsp;<A NAME="460"></A>upon
wealth?&nbsp;<A NAME="461"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="462"></A>
<BR>Also in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only satisfies&nbsp;<A NAME="463"></A>his
necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to them; his other&nbsp;<A NAME="464"></A>desires
he subdues, under the idea that they are unprofitable.&nbsp;<A NAME="465"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="466"></A>
<BR>He is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes&nbsp;<A NAME="467"></A>a
purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud.&nbsp;<A NAME="468"></A>Is
he not a true image of the State which he represents?&nbsp;<A NAME="469"></A>

<P>He appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by&nbsp;<A NAME="470"></A>him
as well as by the State.&nbsp;<A NAME="471"></A>

<P>You see that he is not a man of cultivation, I&nbsp;<A NAME="472"></A>said.&nbsp;<A NAME="473"></A>
<BR>I imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made&nbsp;<A NAME="474"></A>a
blind god director of his chorus, or given him chief&nbsp;<A NAME="475"></A>honour.&nbsp;<A NAME="476"></A>

<P>Excellent! I said. Yet consider: Must we not further admit that&nbsp;<A NAME="477"></A>owing
to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike&nbsp;<A NAME="478"></A>desires
as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general&nbsp;<A NAME="479"></A>habit
of life?&nbsp;<A NAME="480"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="481"></A>
<BR>Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his&nbsp;<A NAME="482"></A>rogueries?&nbsp;<A NAME="483"></A>

<P>Where must I look?&nbsp;<A NAME="484"></A>
<BR>You should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly,&nbsp;<A NAME="485"></A>as
in the guardianship of an orphan.&nbsp;<A NAME="486"></A>

<P>Aye.&nbsp;<A NAME="487"></A>
<BR>It will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give&nbsp;<A NAME="488"></A>him
a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced&nbsp;<A NAME="489"></A>virtue;
not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by reason,&nbsp;<A NAME="490"></A>but
by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he trembles for&nbsp;<A NAME="491"></A>his
possessions.&nbsp;<A NAME="492"></A>

<P>To be sure.&nbsp;<A NAME="493"></A>
<BR>Yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires&nbsp;<A NAME="494"></A>of
the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend&nbsp;<A NAME="495"></A>what
is not his own.&nbsp;<A NAME="496"></A>

<P>Yes, and they will be strong in him too.&nbsp;<A NAME="497"></A>
<BR>The man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and&nbsp;<A NAME="498"></A>not
one; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail over&nbsp;<A NAME="499"></A>his
inferior ones.&nbsp;<A NAME="500"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="501"></A>
<BR>For these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people;&nbsp;<A NAME="502"></A>yet
the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away&nbsp;<A NAME="503"></A>and
never come near him.&nbsp;<A NAME="504"></A>

<P>I should expect so.&nbsp;<A NAME="505"></A>
<BR>And surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in&nbsp;<A NAME="506"></A>a
State for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition;&nbsp;<A NAME="507"></A>he
will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he of&nbsp;<A NAME="508"></A>awakening
his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in&nbsp;<A NAME="509"></A>the
struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part&nbsp;<A NAME="510"></A>only
of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses the prize&nbsp;<A NAME="511"></A>and
saves his money.&nbsp;<A NAME="512"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="513"></A>
<BR>Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers&nbsp;<A NAME="514"></A>to
the oligarchical State?&nbsp;<A NAME="515"></A>

<P>There can be no doubt.&nbsp;<A NAME="516"></A>
<BR>Next comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to be&nbsp;<A NAME="517"></A>considered
by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic&nbsp;<A NAME="518"></A>man,
and bring him up for judgement.&nbsp;<A NAME="519"></A>

<P>That, he said, is our method.&nbsp;<A NAME="520"></A>
<BR>Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy&nbsp;<A NAME="521"></A>arise?
Is it not on this wise? --The good at which such a State alms is&nbsp;<A NAME="522"></A>to
become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?&nbsp;<A NAME="523"></A>

<P>What then?&nbsp;<A NAME="524"></A>
<BR>The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse&nbsp;<A NAME="525"></A>to
curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they&nbsp;<A NAME="526"></A>gain
by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates&nbsp;<A NAME="527"></A>and
thus increase their own wealth and importance?&nbsp;<A NAME="528"></A>

<P>To be sure.&nbsp;<A NAME="529"></A>
<BR>There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation&nbsp;<A NAME="530"></A>cannot
exist together in citizens of the same State to any considerable&nbsp;<A NAME="531"></A>extent;
one or the other will be disregarded.&nbsp;<A NAME="532"></A>

<P>That is tolerably clear.&nbsp;<A NAME="533"></A>
<BR>And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness&nbsp;<A NAME="534"></A>and
extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to&nbsp;<A NAME="535"></A>beggary?&nbsp;<A NAME="536"></A>

<P>Yes, often.&nbsp;<A NAME="537"></A>
<BR>And still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and&nbsp;<A NAME="538"></A>fully
armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their citizenship;&nbsp;<A NAME="539"></A>a
third class are in both predicaments; and they hate and conspire against&nbsp;<A NAME="540"></A>those
who have got their property, and against everybody else, and are&nbsp;<A NAME="541"></A>eager
for revolution.&nbsp;<A NAME="542"></A>

<P>That is true.&nbsp;<A NAME="543"></A>
<BR>On the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and&nbsp;<A NAME="544"></A>pretending
not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert&nbsp;<A NAME="545"></A>their
sting --that is, their money --into some one else who is not on his&nbsp;<A NAME="546"></A>guard
against them, and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied&nbsp;<A NAME="547"></A>into
a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper to abound&nbsp;<A NAME="548"></A>in
the State.&nbsp;<A NAME="549"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, there are plenty of them --that is&nbsp;<A NAME="550"></A>certain.&nbsp;<A NAME="551"></A>
<BR>The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either&nbsp;<A NAME="552"></A>by
restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another&nbsp;<A NAME="553"></A>remedy:&nbsp;<A NAME="554"></A>

<P>What other?&nbsp;<A NAME="555"></A>
<BR>One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the&nbsp;<A NAME="556"></A>citizens
to look to their characters: --Let there be a general rule that&nbsp;<A NAME="557"></A>every
one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and there&nbsp;<A NAME="558"></A>will
be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of which we&nbsp;<A NAME="559"></A>were
speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.&nbsp;<A NAME="560"></A>

<P>Yes, they will be greatly lessened.&nbsp;<A NAME="561"></A>
<BR>At present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named,&nbsp;<A NAME="562"></A>treat
their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially&nbsp;<A NAME="563"></A>the
young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of&nbsp;<A NAME="564"></A>luxury
and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are incapable&nbsp;<A NAME="565"></A>of
resisting either pleasure or pain.&nbsp;<A NAME="566"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="567"></A>
<BR>They themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent&nbsp;<A NAME="568"></A>as
the pauper to the cultivation of virtue.&nbsp;<A NAME="569"></A>

<P>Yes, quite as indifferent.&nbsp;<A NAME="570"></A>
<BR>Such is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often rulers&nbsp;<A NAME="571"></A>and
their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on a pilgrimage&nbsp;<A NAME="572"></A>or
a march, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye, and they may observe&nbsp;<A NAME="573"></A>the
behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger --for where danger&nbsp;<A NAME="574"></A>is,
there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich --and very&nbsp;<A NAME="575"></A>likely
the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of&nbsp;<A NAME="576"></A>a
wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous&nbsp;<A NAME="577"></A>flesh
--when he sees such an one puffing and at his wit's end, how can&nbsp;<A NAME="578"></A>he
avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because&nbsp;<A NAME="579"></A>no
one has the courage to despoil them? And when they meet in private will&nbsp;<A NAME="580"></A>not
people be saying to one another 'Our warriors are not good for&nbsp;<A NAME="581"></A>much'?&nbsp;<A NAME="582"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of&nbsp;<A NAME="583"></A>talking.&nbsp;<A NAME="584"></A>
<BR>And, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without&nbsp;<A NAME="585"></A>may
bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external provocation&nbsp;<A NAME="586"></A>a
commotion may arise within-in the same way wherever there is weakness&nbsp;<A NAME="587"></A>in
the State there is also likely to be illness, of which the occasions&nbsp;<A NAME="588"></A>may
be very slight, the one party introducing from without their oligarchical,&nbsp;<A NAME="589"></A>the
other their democratical allies, and then the State falls sick, and&nbsp;<A NAME="590"></A>is
at war with herself; and may be at times distracted, even when there&nbsp;<A NAME="591"></A>is
no external cause.&nbsp;<A NAME="592"></A>

<P>Yes, surely.&nbsp;<A NAME="593"></A>
<BR>And then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their&nbsp;<A NAME="594"></A>opponents,
slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder&nbsp;<A NAME="595"></A>they
give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of&nbsp;<A NAME="596"></A>government
in which the magistrates are commonly elected by&nbsp;<A NAME="597"></A>lot.&nbsp;<A NAME="598"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution&nbsp;<A NAME="599"></A>has
been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite party&nbsp;<A NAME="600"></A>to
withdraw.&nbsp;<A NAME="601"></A>

<P>And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government&nbsp;<A NAME="602"></A>have
they? for as the government is, such will be the&nbsp;<A NAME="603"></A>man.&nbsp;<A NAME="604"></A>

<P>Clearly, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="605"></A>
<BR>In the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of&nbsp;<A NAME="606"></A>freedom
and frankness --a man may say and do what he&nbsp;<A NAME="607"></A>likes?&nbsp;<A NAME="608"></A>

<P>'Tis said so, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="609"></A>
<BR>And where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for himself&nbsp;<A NAME="610"></A>his
own life as he pleases?&nbsp;<A NAME="611"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="612"></A>
<BR>Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human&nbsp;<A NAME="613"></A>natures?&nbsp;<A NAME="614"></A>

<P>There will.&nbsp;<A NAME="615"></A>
<BR>This, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being an embroidered&nbsp;<A NAME="616"></A>robe
which is spangled with every sort of flower. And just as women and&nbsp;<A NAME="617"></A>children
think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming,&nbsp;<A NAME="618"></A>so
there are many men to whom this State, which is spangled with the manners&nbsp;<A NAME="619"></A>and
characters of mankind, will appear to be the fairest of&nbsp;<A NAME="620"></A>States.&nbsp;<A NAME="621"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="622"></A>
<BR>Yes, my good Sir, and there will be no better in which to look for&nbsp;<A NAME="623"></A>a
government.&nbsp;<A NAME="624"></A>

<P>Why?&nbsp;<A NAME="625"></A>
<BR>Because of the liberty which reigns there --they have a complete assortment&nbsp;<A NAME="626"></A>of
constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State, as we have&nbsp;<A NAME="627"></A>been
doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they&nbsp;<A NAME="628"></A>sell
them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when he has made&nbsp;<A NAME="629"></A>his
choice, he may found his State.&nbsp;<A NAME="630"></A>

<P>He will be sure to have patterns enough.&nbsp;<A NAME="631"></A>
<BR>And there being no necessity, I said, for you to govern in this State,&nbsp;<A NAME="632"></A>even
if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like, or go&nbsp;<A NAME="633"></A>to
war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others are at peace,&nbsp;<A NAME="634"></A>unless
you are so disposed --there being no necessity also, because some&nbsp;<A NAME="635"></A>law
forbids you to hold office or be a dicast, that you should not hold&nbsp;<A NAME="636"></A>office
or be a dicast, if you have a fancy --is not this a way of life&nbsp;<A NAME="637"></A>which
for the moment is supremely delightful&nbsp;<A NAME="638"></A>

<P>For the moment, yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="639"></A>
<BR>And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?&nbsp;<A NAME="640"></A>Have
you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons, although they&nbsp;<A NAME="641"></A>have
been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are and walk&nbsp;<A NAME="642"></A>about
the world --the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees or&nbsp;<A NAME="643"></A>cares?&nbsp;<A NAME="644"></A>

<P>Yes, he replied, many and many a one.&nbsp;<A NAME="645"></A>
<BR>See too, I said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't&nbsp;<A NAME="646"></A>care'
about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine&nbsp;<A NAME="647"></A>principles
which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city --as&nbsp;<A NAME="648"></A>when
we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted nature, there&nbsp;<A NAME="649"></A>never
will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play&nbsp;<A NAME="650"></A>amid
things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study --how grandly&nbsp;<A NAME="651"></A>does
she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet, never giving&nbsp;<A NAME="652"></A>a
thought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and promoting to honour&nbsp;<A NAME="653"></A>any
one who professes to be the people's friend.&nbsp;<A NAME="654"></A>

<P>Yes, she is of a noble spirit.&nbsp;<A NAME="655"></A>
<BR>These and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which&nbsp;<A NAME="656"></A>is
a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing&nbsp;<A NAME="657"></A>a
sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.&nbsp;<A NAME="658"></A>

<P>We know her well.&nbsp;<A NAME="659"></A>
<BR>Consider now, I said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather&nbsp;<A NAME="660"></A>consider,
as in the case of the State, how he comes into&nbsp;<A NAME="661"></A>being.&nbsp;<A NAME="662"></A>

<P>Very good, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="663"></A>
<BR>Is not this the way --he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical&nbsp;<A NAME="664"></A>father
who has trained him in his own habits?&nbsp;<A NAME="665"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="666"></A>
<BR>And, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are&nbsp;<A NAME="667"></A>of
the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are called&nbsp;<A NAME="668"></A>unnecessary?&nbsp;<A NAME="669"></A>

<P>Obviously.&nbsp;<A NAME="670"></A>
<BR>Would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are&nbsp;<A NAME="671"></A>the
necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?&nbsp;<A NAME="672"></A>

<P>I should.&nbsp;<A NAME="673"></A>
<BR>Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of&nbsp;<A NAME="674"></A>which
the satisfaction is a benefit to us? And they are rightly so, because&nbsp;<A NAME="675"></A>we
are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary,&nbsp;<A NAME="676"></A>and
cannot help it.&nbsp;<A NAME="677"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="678"></A>
<BR>We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?&nbsp;<A NAME="679"></A>
<BR>We are not.&nbsp;<A NAME="680"></A>
<BR>And the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from&nbsp;<A NAME="681"></A>his
youth upwards --of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and&nbsp;<A NAME="682"></A>in
some cases the reverse of good --shall we not be right in saying that&nbsp;<A NAME="683"></A>all
these are unnecessary?&nbsp;<A NAME="684"></A>

<P>Yes, certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="685"></A>
<BR>Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have&nbsp;<A NAME="686"></A>a
general notion of them?&nbsp;<A NAME="687"></A>

<P>Very good.&nbsp;<A NAME="688"></A>
<BR>Will not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments,&nbsp;<A NAME="689"></A>in
so far as they are required for health and strength, be of the necessary&nbsp;<A NAME="690"></A>class?&nbsp;<A NAME="691"></A>

<P>That is what I should suppose.&nbsp;<A NAME="692"></A>
<BR>The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and&nbsp;<A NAME="693"></A>it
is essential to the continuance of life?&nbsp;<A NAME="694"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="695"></A>
<BR>But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for&nbsp;<A NAME="696"></A>health?&nbsp;<A NAME="697"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="698"></A>
<BR>And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other&nbsp;<A NAME="699"></A>luxuries,
which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained&nbsp;<A NAME="700"></A>in
youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit&nbsp;<A NAME="701"></A>of
wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?&nbsp;<A NAME="702"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="703"></A>
<BR>May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money&nbsp;<A NAME="704"></A>because
they conduce to production?&nbsp;<A NAME="705"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="706"></A>
<BR>And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds&nbsp;<A NAME="707"></A>good?&nbsp;<A NAME="708"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="709"></A>
<BR>And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures&nbsp;<A NAME="710"></A>and
desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary desires,&nbsp;<A NAME="711"></A>whereas
he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and&nbsp;<A NAME="712"></A>oligarchical?&nbsp;<A NAME="713"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="714"></A>
<BR>Again, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical:&nbsp;<A NAME="715"></A>the
following, as I suspect, is commonly the process.&nbsp;<A NAME="716"></A>

<P>What is the process?&nbsp;<A NAME="717"></A>
<BR>When a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing,&nbsp;<A NAME="718"></A>in
a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and has come to associate&nbsp;<A NAME="719"></A>with
fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts&nbsp;<A NAME="720"></A>of
refinements and varieties of pleasure --then, as you may imagine, the&nbsp;<A NAME="721"></A>change
will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the&nbsp;<A NAME="722"></A>democratical?&nbsp;<A NAME="723"></A>

<P>Inevitably.&nbsp;<A NAME="724"></A>
<BR>And as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected&nbsp;<A NAME="725"></A>by
an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so&nbsp;<A NAME="726"></A>too
the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without&nbsp;<A NAME="727"></A>to
assist the desires within him, that which is and alike again helping&nbsp;<A NAME="728"></A>that
which is akin and alike?&nbsp;<A NAME="729"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="730"></A>
<BR>And if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within&nbsp;<A NAME="731"></A>him,
whether the influence of a father or of kindred, advising or rebuking&nbsp;<A NAME="732"></A>him,
then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction, and&nbsp;<A NAME="733"></A>he
goes to war with himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="734"></A>

<P>It must be so.&nbsp;<A NAME="735"></A>
<BR>And there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the&nbsp;<A NAME="736"></A>oligarchical,
and some of his desires die, and others are banished; a spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="737"></A>of
reverence enters into the young man's soul and order is&nbsp;<A NAME="738"></A>restored.&nbsp;<A NAME="739"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that sometimes happens.&nbsp;<A NAME="740"></A>
<BR>And then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh&nbsp;<A NAME="741"></A>ones
spring up, which are akin to them, and because he, their father, does&nbsp;<A NAME="742"></A>not
know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.&nbsp;<A NAME="743"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that is apt to be the way.&nbsp;<A NAME="744"></A>
<BR>They draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse&nbsp;<A NAME="745"></A>with
them, breed and multiply in him.&nbsp;<A NAME="746"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="747"></A>
<BR>At length they seize upon the citadel of the young man's soul, which&nbsp;<A NAME="748"></A>they
perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true&nbsp;<A NAME="749"></A>words,
which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods,&nbsp;<A NAME="750"></A>and
are their best guardians and sentinels.&nbsp;<A NAME="751"></A>

<P>None better.&nbsp;<A NAME="752"></A>
<BR>False and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their&nbsp;<A NAME="753"></A>place.&nbsp;<A NAME="754"></A>

<P>They are certain to do so.&nbsp;<A NAME="755"></A>
<BR>And so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters,&nbsp;<A NAME="756"></A>and
takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help&nbsp;<A NAME="757"></A>be
sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain&nbsp;<A NAME="758"></A>conceits
shut the gate of the king's fastness; and they will neither allow&nbsp;<A NAME="759"></A>the
embassy itself to enter, private if private advisers offer the fatherly&nbsp;<A NAME="760"></A>counsel
of the aged will they listen to them or receive them. There is&nbsp;<A NAME="761"></A>a
battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which they call silliness,&nbsp;<A NAME="762"></A>is
ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and temperance, which they&nbsp;<A NAME="763"></A>nickname
unmanliness, is trampled in the mire and cast forth; they persuade&nbsp;<A NAME="764"></A>men
that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness,&nbsp;<A NAME="765"></A>and
so, by the help of a rabble of evil appetites, they drive them beyond&nbsp;<A NAME="766"></A>the
border.&nbsp;<A NAME="767"></A>

<P>Yes, with a will.&nbsp;<A NAME="768"></A>
<BR>And when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now&nbsp;<A NAME="769"></A>in
their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries, the&nbsp;<A NAME="770"></A>next
thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste&nbsp;<A NAME="771"></A>and
impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads, and a great&nbsp;<A NAME="772"></A>company
with them, hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names;&nbsp;<A NAME="773"></A>insolence
they term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and waste magnificence,&nbsp;<A NAME="774"></A>and
impudence courage. And so the young man passes out of his original&nbsp;<A NAME="775"></A>nature,
which was trained in the school of necessity, into the freedom&nbsp;<A NAME="776"></A>and
libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures.&nbsp;<A NAME="777"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.&nbsp;<A NAME="778"></A>
<BR>After this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on unnecessary&nbsp;<A NAME="779"></A>pleasures
quite as much as on necessary ones; but if he be fortunate, and&nbsp;<A NAME="780"></A>is
not too much disordered in his wits, when years have elapsed, and the&nbsp;<A NAME="781"></A>heyday
of passion is over --supposing that he then re-admits into the city&nbsp;<A NAME="782"></A>some
part of the exiled virtues, and does not wholly give himself up to&nbsp;<A NAME="783"></A>their
successors --in that case he balances his pleasures and lives in&nbsp;<A NAME="784"></A>a
sort of equilibrium, putting the government of himself into the hands&nbsp;<A NAME="785"></A>of
the one which comes first and wins the turn; and when he has had enough&nbsp;<A NAME="786"></A>of
that, then into the hands of another; he despises none of them but encourages&nbsp;<A NAME="787"></A>them
all equally.&nbsp;<A NAME="788"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="789"></A>
<BR>Neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word&nbsp;<A NAME="790"></A>of
advice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions&nbsp;<A NAME="791"></A>of
good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and that he ought&nbsp;<A NAME="792"></A>to
use and honour some and chastise and master the others --whenever this&nbsp;<A NAME="793"></A>is
repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike,&nbsp;<A NAME="794"></A>and
that one is as good as another.&nbsp;<A NAME="795"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; that is the way with him.&nbsp;<A NAME="796"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the&nbsp;<A NAME="797"></A>hour;
and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute; then&nbsp;<A NAME="798"></A>he
becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a turn&nbsp;<A NAME="799"></A>at
gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once more&nbsp;<A NAME="800"></A>living
the life of a philosopher; often he-is busy with politics, and starts&nbsp;<A NAME="801"></A>to
his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head; and, if he&nbsp;<A NAME="802"></A>is
emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is in that direction, or&nbsp;<A NAME="803"></A>of
men of business, once more in that. His life has neither law nor order;&nbsp;<A NAME="804"></A>and
this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom; and so&nbsp;<A NAME="805"></A>he
goes on.&nbsp;<A NAME="806"></A>

<P>Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.&nbsp;<A NAME="807"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the&nbsp;<A NAME="808"></A>lives
of many; --he answers to the State which we described as fair and&nbsp;<A NAME="809"></A>spangled.
And many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern,&nbsp;<A NAME="810"></A>and
many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in&nbsp;<A NAME="811"></A>him.&nbsp;<A NAME="812"></A>

<P>Just so.&nbsp;<A NAME="813"></A>
<BR>Let him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called&nbsp;<A NAME="814"></A>the
democratic man.&nbsp;<A NAME="815"></A>

<P>Let that be his place, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="816"></A>
<BR>Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike, tyranny&nbsp;<A NAME="817"></A>and
the tyrant; these we have now to consider.&nbsp;<A NAME="818"></A>

<P>Quite true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="819"></A>
<BR>Say then, my friend, in what manner does tyranny arise? --that it has&nbsp;<A NAME="820"></A>a
democratic origin is evident.&nbsp;<A NAME="821"></A>

<P>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="822"></A>
<BR>And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy&nbsp;<A NAME="823"></A>from
oligarchy --I mean, after a sort?&nbsp;<A NAME="824"></A>

<P>How?&nbsp;<A NAME="825"></A>
<BR>The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which&nbsp;<A NAME="826"></A>it
was maintained was excess of wealth --am I not right?&nbsp;<A NAME="827"></A>

<P>Yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="828"></A>
<BR>And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things&nbsp;<A NAME="829"></A>for
the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?&nbsp;<A NAME="830"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="831"></A>
<BR>And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings&nbsp;<A NAME="832"></A>her
to dissolution?&nbsp;<A NAME="833"></A>

<P>What good?&nbsp;<A NAME="834"></A>
<BR>Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the&nbsp;<A NAME="835"></A>glory
of the State --and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman&nbsp;<A NAME="836"></A>of
nature deign to dwell.&nbsp;<A NAME="837"></A>

<P>Yes; the saying is in everybody's mouth.&nbsp;<A NAME="838"></A>
<BR>I was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the&nbsp;<A NAME="839"></A>neglect
of other things introduces the change in democracy, which occasions&nbsp;<A NAME="840"></A>a
demand for tyranny.&nbsp;<A NAME="841"></A>

<P>How so?&nbsp;<A NAME="842"></A>
<BR>When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers&nbsp;<A NAME="843"></A>presiding
over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of&nbsp;<A NAME="844"></A>freedom,
then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful&nbsp;<A NAME="845"></A>draught,
she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they&nbsp;<A NAME="846"></A>are
cursed oligarchs.&nbsp;<A NAME="847"></A>

<P>Yes, he replied, a very common occurrence.&nbsp;<A NAME="848"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves&nbsp;<A NAME="849"></A>who
hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are&nbsp;<A NAME="850"></A>like
rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her&nbsp;<A NAME="851"></A>own
heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public. Now,&nbsp;<A NAME="852"></A>in
such a State, can liberty have any limit?&nbsp;<A NAME="853"></A>

<P>Certainly not.&nbsp;<A NAME="854"></A>
<BR>By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by&nbsp;<A NAME="855"></A>getting
among the animals and infecting them.&nbsp;<A NAME="856"></A>

<P>How do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="857"></A>
<BR>I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of&nbsp;<A NAME="858"></A>his
sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he&nbsp;<A NAME="859"></A>having
no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is his&nbsp;<A NAME="860"></A>freedom,
and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic,&nbsp;<A NAME="861"></A>and
the stranger is quite as good as either.&nbsp;<A NAME="862"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that is the way.&nbsp;<A NAME="863"></A>
<BR>And these are not the only evils, I said --there are several lesser&nbsp;<A NAME="864"></A>ones:
In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars,&nbsp;<A NAME="865"></A>and
the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are all&nbsp;<A NAME="866"></A>alike;
and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready to compete&nbsp;<A NAME="867"></A>with
him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the young and are full&nbsp;<A NAME="868"></A>of
pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative,&nbsp;<A NAME="869"></A>and
therefore they adopt the manners of the young.&nbsp;<A NAME="870"></A>

<P>Quite true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="871"></A>
<BR>The last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money,&nbsp;<A NAME="872"></A>whether
male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser; nor must&nbsp;<A NAME="873"></A>I
forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation&nbsp;<A NAME="874"></A>to
each other.&nbsp;<A NAME="875"></A>

<P>Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our&nbsp;<A NAME="876"></A>lips?&nbsp;<A NAME="877"></A>
<BR>That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who&nbsp;<A NAME="878"></A>does
not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the&nbsp;<A NAME="879"></A>animals
who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any&nbsp;<A NAME="880"></A>other
State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as good&nbsp;<A NAME="881"></A>as
their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of marching&nbsp;<A NAME="882"></A>along
with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they will run at&nbsp;<A NAME="883"></A>anybody
who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for&nbsp;<A NAME="884"></A>them:
and all things are just ready to burst with liberty.&nbsp;<A NAME="885"></A>

<P>When I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you&nbsp;<A NAME="886"></A>describe.
You and I have dreamed the same thing.&nbsp;<A NAME="887"></A>

<P>And above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive&nbsp;<A NAME="888"></A>the
citizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority&nbsp;<A NAME="889"></A>and
at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the laws, written&nbsp;<A NAME="890"></A>or
unwritten; they will have no one over them.&nbsp;<A NAME="891"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, I know it too well.&nbsp;<A NAME="892"></A>
<BR>Such, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of&nbsp;<A NAME="893"></A>which
springs tyranny.&nbsp;<A NAME="894"></A>

<P>Glorious indeed, he said. But what is the next&nbsp;<A NAME="895"></A>step?&nbsp;<A NAME="896"></A>
<BR>The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified&nbsp;<A NAME="897"></A>and
intensified by liberty overmasters democracy --the truth being that&nbsp;<A NAME="898"></A>the
excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite&nbsp;<A NAME="899"></A>direction;
and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable&nbsp;<A NAME="900"></A>and
animal life, but above all in forms of government.&nbsp;<A NAME="901"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="902"></A>
<BR>The excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems only&nbsp;<A NAME="903"></A>to
pass into excess of slavery.&nbsp;<A NAME="904"></A>

<P>Yes, the natural order.&nbsp;<A NAME="905"></A>
<BR>And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated&nbsp;<A NAME="906"></A>form
of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of&nbsp;<A NAME="907"></A>liberty?&nbsp;<A NAME="908"></A>

<P>As we might expect.&nbsp;<A NAME="909"></A>
<BR>That, however, was not, as I believe, your question-you rather desired&nbsp;<A NAME="910"></A>to
know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and&nbsp;<A NAME="911"></A>democracy,
and is the ruin of both?&nbsp;<A NAME="912"></A>

<P>Just so, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="913"></A>
<BR>Well, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts, of&nbsp;<A NAME="914"></A>whom
the more courageous are the-leaders and the more timid the followers,&nbsp;<A NAME="915"></A>the
same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless, and others having&nbsp;<A NAME="916"></A>stings.&nbsp;<A NAME="917"></A>

<P>A very just comparison.&nbsp;<A NAME="918"></A>
<BR>These two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated,&nbsp;<A NAME="919"></A>being
what phlegm and bile are to the body. And the good physician and&nbsp;<A NAME="920"></A>lawgiver
of the State ought, like the wise bee-master, to keep them at&nbsp;<A NAME="921"></A>a
distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming in; and if they&nbsp;<A NAME="922"></A>have
anyhow found a way in, then he should have them and their cells cut&nbsp;<A NAME="923"></A>out
as speedily as possible.&nbsp;<A NAME="924"></A>

<P>Yes, by all means, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="925"></A>
<BR>Then, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us imagine&nbsp;<A NAME="926"></A>democracy
to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes; for in the&nbsp;<A NAME="927"></A>first
place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there&nbsp;<A NAME="928"></A>were
in the oligarchical State.&nbsp;<A NAME="929"></A>

<P>That is true.&nbsp;<A NAME="930"></A>
<BR>And in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.&nbsp;<A NAME="931"></A>
<BR>How so?&nbsp;<A NAME="932"></A>
<BR>Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven&nbsp;<A NAME="933"></A>from
office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas&nbsp;<A NAME="934"></A>in
a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener&nbsp;<A NAME="935"></A>sort
speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer&nbsp;<A NAME="936"></A>a
word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost everything&nbsp;<A NAME="937"></A>is
managed by the drones.&nbsp;<A NAME="938"></A>

<P>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="939"></A>
<BR>Then there is another class which is always being severed from the&nbsp;<A NAME="940"></A>mass.&nbsp;<A NAME="941"></A>

<P>What is that?&nbsp;<A NAME="942"></A>
<BR>They are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders sure to be&nbsp;<A NAME="943"></A>the
richest.&nbsp;<A NAME="944"></A>

<P>Naturally so.&nbsp;<A NAME="945"></A>
<BR>They are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of&nbsp;<A NAME="946"></A>honey
to the drones.&nbsp;<A NAME="947"></A>

<P>Why, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who&nbsp;<A NAME="948"></A>have
little.&nbsp;<A NAME="949"></A>

<P>And this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon&nbsp;<A NAME="950"></A>them.&nbsp;<A NAME="951"></A>
<BR>That is pretty much the case, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="952"></A>
<BR>The people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their&nbsp;<A NAME="953"></A>own
hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon. This,&nbsp;<A NAME="954"></A>when
assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a&nbsp;<A NAME="955"></A>democracy.&nbsp;<A NAME="956"></A>

<P>True, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate&nbsp;<A NAME="957"></A>unless
they get a little honey.&nbsp;<A NAME="958"></A>

<P>And do they not share? I said. Do not their leaders deprive the&nbsp;<A NAME="959"></A>rich
of their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same&nbsp;<A NAME="960"></A>time
taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?&nbsp;<A NAME="961"></A>

<P>Why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do&nbsp;<A NAME="962"></A>share.&nbsp;<A NAME="963"></A>
<BR>And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to&nbsp;<A NAME="964"></A>defend
themselves before the people as they best can?&nbsp;<A NAME="965"></A>

<P>What else can they do?&nbsp;<A NAME="966"></A>
<BR>And then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge&nbsp;<A NAME="967"></A>them
with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?&nbsp;<A NAME="968"></A>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="969"></A>

<P>And the end is that when they see the people, not of their own&nbsp;<A NAME="970"></A>accord,
but through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers,&nbsp;<A NAME="971"></A>seeking
to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become oligarchs&nbsp;<A NAME="972"></A>in
reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the drones torments&nbsp;<A NAME="973"></A>them
and breeds revolution in them.&nbsp;<A NAME="974"></A>

<P>That is exactly the truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="975"></A>
<BR>Then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one&nbsp;<A NAME="976"></A>another.&nbsp;<A NAME="977"></A>
<BR>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="978"></A>
<BR>The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse&nbsp;<A NAME="979"></A>into
greatness.&nbsp;<A NAME="980"></A>

<P>Yes, that is their way.&nbsp;<A NAME="981"></A>
<BR>This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he&nbsp;<A NAME="982"></A>first
appears above ground he is a protector.&nbsp;<A NAME="983"></A>

<P>Yes, that is quite clear.&nbsp;<A NAME="984"></A>
<BR>How then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? Clearly when&nbsp;<A NAME="985"></A>he
does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple of&nbsp;<A NAME="986"></A>Lycaean
Zeus.&nbsp;<A NAME="987"></A>

<P>What tale?&nbsp;<A NAME="988"></A>
<BR>The tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim&nbsp;<A NAME="989"></A>minced
up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf.&nbsp;<A NAME="990"></A>Did
you never hear it?&nbsp;<A NAME="991"></A>

<P>Oh, yes.&nbsp;<A NAME="992"></A>
<BR>And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely&nbsp;<A NAME="993"></A>at
his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen;&nbsp;<A NAME="994"></A>by
the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and&nbsp;<A NAME="995"></A>murders
them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy tongue&nbsp;<A NAME="996"></A>and
lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen; some he kills and others&nbsp;<A NAME="997"></A>he
banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition&nbsp;<A NAME="998"></A>of
lands: and after this, what will be his destiny? Must he not either&nbsp;<A NAME="999"></A>perish
at the hands of his enemies, or from being a man become a wolf --that&nbsp;<A NAME="1000"></A>is,
a tyrant?&nbsp;<A NAME="1001"></A>

<P>Inevitably.&nbsp;<A NAME="1002"></A>
<BR>This, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the&nbsp;<A NAME="1003"></A>rich?&nbsp;<A NAME="1004"></A>
<BR>The same.&nbsp;<A NAME="1005"></A>
<BR>After a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his enemies,&nbsp;<A NAME="1006"></A>a
tyrant full grown.&nbsp;<A NAME="1007"></A>

<P>That is clear.&nbsp;<A NAME="1008"></A>
<BR>And if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death&nbsp;<A NAME="1009"></A>by
a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate&nbsp;<A NAME="1010"></A>him.&nbsp;<A NAME="1011"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, that is their usual way.&nbsp;<A NAME="1012"></A>
<BR>Then comes the famous request for a bodyguard, which is the device&nbsp;<A NAME="1013"></A>of
all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career --'Let not&nbsp;<A NAME="1014"></A>the
people's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.'&nbsp;<A NAME="1015"></A>

<P>Exactly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1016"></A>
<BR>The people readily assent; all their fears are for him --they have&nbsp;<A NAME="1017"></A>none
for themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="1018"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="1019"></A>
<BR>And when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy&nbsp;<A NAME="1020"></A>of
the people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to&nbsp;<A NAME="1021"></A>Croesus,&nbsp;<A NAME="1022"></A>

<P>By pebbly Hermus' shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed&nbsp;<A NAME="1023"></A>to
be a coward.&nbsp;<A NAME="1024"></A>

<P>And quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be&nbsp;<A NAME="1025"></A>ashamed
again.&nbsp;<A NAME="1026"></A>

<P>But if he is caught he dies.&nbsp;<A NAME="1027"></A>
<BR>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="1028"></A>
<BR>And he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not 'larding&nbsp;<A NAME="1029"></A>the
plain' with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing&nbsp;<A NAME="1030"></A>up
in the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer protector,&nbsp;<A NAME="1031"></A>but
tyrant absolute.&nbsp;<A NAME="1032"></A>

<P>No doubt, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1033"></A>
<BR>And now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the State&nbsp;<A NAME="1034"></A>in
which a creature like him is generated.&nbsp;<A NAME="1035"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, let us consider that.&nbsp;<A NAME="1036"></A>
<BR>At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1037"></A>he
salutes every one whom he meets; --he to be called a tyrant, who is&nbsp;<A NAME="1038"></A>making
promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1039"></A>distributing
land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so&nbsp;<A NAME="1040"></A>kind
and good to every one!&nbsp;<A NAME="1041"></A>

<P>Of course, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1042"></A>
<BR>But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty,&nbsp;<A NAME="1043"></A>and
there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some&nbsp;<A NAME="1044"></A>war
or other, in order that the people may require a&nbsp;<A NAME="1045"></A>leader.&nbsp;<A NAME="1046"></A>

<P>To be sure.&nbsp;<A NAME="1047"></A>
<BR>Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished&nbsp;<A NAME="1048"></A>by
payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily&nbsp;<A NAME="1049"></A>wants
and therefore less likely to conspire against him?&nbsp;<A NAME="1050"></A>Clearly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1051"></A>

<P>And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom,&nbsp;<A NAME="1052"></A>and
of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for destroying&nbsp;<A NAME="1053"></A>them
by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all these reasons&nbsp;<A NAME="1054"></A>the
tyrant must be always getting up a war.&nbsp;<A NAME="1055"></A>

<P>He must.&nbsp;<A NAME="1056"></A>
<BR>Now he begins to grow unpopular.&nbsp;<A NAME="1057"></A>
<BR>A necessary result.&nbsp;<A NAME="1058"></A>
<BR>Then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,&nbsp;<A NAME="1059"></A>speak
their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of&nbsp;<A NAME="1060"></A>them
cast in his teeth what is being done.&nbsp;<A NAME="1061"></A>

<P>Yes, that may be expected.&nbsp;<A NAME="1062"></A>
<BR>And the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot&nbsp;<A NAME="1063"></A>stop
while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for&nbsp;<A NAME="1064"></A>anything.&nbsp;<A NAME="1065"></A>

<P>He cannot.&nbsp;<A NAME="1066"></A>
<BR>And therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is&nbsp;<A NAME="1067"></A>high-minded,
who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy of&nbsp;<A NAME="1068"></A>them
all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no, until&nbsp;<A NAME="1069"></A>he
has made a purgation of the State.&nbsp;<A NAME="1070"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, and a rare purgation.&nbsp;<A NAME="1071"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of&nbsp;<A NAME="1072"></A>the
body; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he&nbsp;<A NAME="1073"></A>does
the reverse.&nbsp;<A NAME="1074"></A>

<P>If he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help&nbsp;<A NAME="1075"></A>himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="1076"></A>
<BR>What a blessed alternative, I said: --to be compelled to dwell only&nbsp;<A NAME="1077"></A>with
the many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at&nbsp;<A NAME="1078"></A>all!&nbsp;<A NAME="1079"></A>

<P>Yes, that is the alternative.&nbsp;<A NAME="1080"></A>
<BR>And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites&nbsp;<A NAME="1081"></A>and
the greater devotion in them will he require?&nbsp;<A NAME="1082"></A>

<P>Certainly.&nbsp;<A NAME="1083"></A>
<BR>And who are the devoted band, and where will he procure&nbsp;<A NAME="1084"></A>them?&nbsp;<A NAME="1085"></A>
<BR>They will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if lie pays&nbsp;<A NAME="1086"></A>them.&nbsp;<A NAME="1087"></A>

<P>By the dog! I said, here are more drones, of every sort and from&nbsp;<A NAME="1088"></A>every
land.&nbsp;<A NAME="1089"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, there are.&nbsp;<A NAME="1090"></A>
<BR>But will he not desire to get them on the spot?&nbsp;<A NAME="1091"></A>
<BR>How do you mean?&nbsp;<A NAME="1092"></A>
<BR>He will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free&nbsp;<A NAME="1093"></A>and
enrol them in his bodyguard.&nbsp;<A NAME="1094"></A>

<P>To be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of&nbsp;<A NAME="1095"></A>all.&nbsp;<A NAME="1096"></A>
<BR>What a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he has put to&nbsp;<A NAME="1097"></A>death
the others and has these for his trusted friends.&nbsp;<A NAME="1098"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; they are quite of his sort.&nbsp;<A NAME="1099"></A>
<BR>Yes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into&nbsp;<A NAME="1100"></A>existence,
who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate and&nbsp;<A NAME="1101"></A>avoid
him.&nbsp;<A NAME="1102"></A>

<P>Of course.&nbsp;<A NAME="1103"></A>
<BR>Verily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great&nbsp;<A NAME="1104"></A>tragedian.&nbsp;<A NAME="1105"></A>

<P>Why so?&nbsp;<A NAME="1106"></A>
<BR>Why, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,&nbsp;<A NAME="1107"></A>

<P>Tyrants are wise by living with the wise; and he clearly meant&nbsp;<A NAME="1108"></A>to
say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his&nbsp;<A NAME="1109"></A>companions.&nbsp;<A NAME="1110"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many&nbsp;<A NAME="1111"></A>other
things of the same kind are said by him and by the other&nbsp;<A NAME="1112"></A>poets.&nbsp;<A NAME="1113"></A>

<P>And therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive&nbsp;<A NAME="1114"></A>us
and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into&nbsp;<A NAME="1115"></A>our
State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.&nbsp;<A NAME="1116"></A>

<P>Yes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive&nbsp;<A NAME="1117"></A>us.&nbsp;<A NAME="1118"></A>
<BR>But they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and&nbsp;<A NAME="1119"></A>hire
voices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over to tyrannies&nbsp;<A NAME="1120"></A>and
democracies.&nbsp;<A NAME="1121"></A>

<P>Very true.&nbsp;<A NAME="1122"></A>
<BR>Moreover, they are paid for this and receive honour --the greatest&nbsp;<A NAME="1123"></A>honour,
as might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest from&nbsp;<A NAME="1124"></A>democracies;
but the higher they ascend our constitution hill, the more&nbsp;<A NAME="1125"></A>their
reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed&nbsp;<A NAME="1126"></A>further.&nbsp;<A NAME="1127"></A>

<P>True.&nbsp;<A NAME="1128"></A>
<BR>But we are wandering from the subject: Let us therefore return and&nbsp;<A NAME="1129"></A>enquire
how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various&nbsp;<A NAME="1130"></A>and
ever-changing army of his.&nbsp;<A NAME="1131"></A>

<P>If, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate&nbsp;<A NAME="1132"></A>and
spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may&nbsp;<A NAME="1133"></A>suffice,
he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise&nbsp;<A NAME="1134"></A>have
to impose upon the people.&nbsp;<A NAME="1135"></A>

<P>And when these fail?&nbsp;<A NAME="1136"></A>
<BR>Why, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male&nbsp;<A NAME="1137"></A>or
female, will be maintained out of his father's estate.&nbsp;<A NAME="1138"></A>

<P>You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being,&nbsp;<A NAME="1139"></A>will
maintain him and his companions?&nbsp;<A NAME="1140"></A>

<P>Yes, he said; they cannot help themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="1141"></A>
<BR>But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up&nbsp;<A NAME="1142"></A>son
ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should&nbsp;<A NAME="1143"></A>be
supported by the son? The father did not bring him into being, or settle&nbsp;<A NAME="1144"></A>him
in life, in order that when his son became a man he should himself&nbsp;<A NAME="1145"></A>be
the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble&nbsp;<A NAME="1146"></A>of
slaves and companions; but that his son should protect him, and that&nbsp;<A NAME="1147"></A>by
his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and&nbsp;<A NAME="1148"></A>aristocratic,
as they are termed. And so he bids him and his companions&nbsp;<A NAME="1149"></A>depart,
just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous&nbsp;<A NAME="1150"></A>son
and his undesirable associates.&nbsp;<A NAME="1151"></A>

<P>By heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster&nbsp;<A NAME="1152"></A>he
has been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out,&nbsp;<A NAME="1153"></A>he
will find that he is weak and his son strong.&nbsp;<A NAME="1154"></A>

<P>Why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence?&nbsp;<A NAME="1155"></A>What!
beat his father if he opposes him?&nbsp;<A NAME="1156"></A>

<P>Yes, he will, having first disarmed him.&nbsp;<A NAME="1157"></A>
<BR>Then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and&nbsp;<A NAME="1158"></A>this
is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as&nbsp;<A NAME="1159"></A>the
saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery&nbsp;<A NAME="1160"></A>of
freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves. Thus&nbsp;<A NAME="1161"></A>liberty,
getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest&nbsp;<A NAME="1162"></A>and
bitterest form of slavery.&nbsp;<A NAME="1163"></A>

<P>True, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="1164"></A>
<BR>Very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed&nbsp;<A NAME="1165"></A>the
nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from democracy&nbsp;<A NAME="1166"></A>to
tyranny?&nbsp;<A NAME="1167"></A>

<P>Yes, quite enough, he said.&nbsp;<A NAME="end"></A>
