<A NAME="start"></A><A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="11"></A>

<P>With these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the discussion;&nbsp;<A NAME="12"></A>but
the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For Glaucon, who&nbsp;<A NAME="13"></A>is
always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus'&nbsp;<A NAME="14"></A>retirement;
he wanted to have the battle out. So he said to me: Socrates,&nbsp;<A NAME="15"></A>do
you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded us,&nbsp;<A NAME="16"></A>that
to be just is always better than to be unjust?&nbsp;<A NAME="17"></A>

<P>I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I&nbsp;<A NAME="18"></A>could.&nbsp;<A NAME="19"></A>
<BR>Then you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now: --How would&nbsp;<A NAME="20"></A>you
arrange goods --are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes,&nbsp;<A NAME="21"></A>and
independently of their consequences, as, for example, harmless pleasures&nbsp;<A NAME="22"></A>and
enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although nothing follows&nbsp;<A NAME="23"></A>from
them?&nbsp;<A NAME="24"></A>

<P>I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I&nbsp;<A NAME="25"></A>replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="26"></A>
<BR>Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,&nbsp;<A NAME="27"></A>health,
which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their&nbsp;<A NAME="28"></A>results?&nbsp;<A NAME="29"></A>

<P>Certainly, I said.&nbsp;<A NAME="30"></A>
<BR>And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the&nbsp;<A NAME="31"></A>care
of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of money-making&nbsp;<A NAME="32"></A>--these
do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and no one would&nbsp;<A NAME="33"></A>choose
them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of some reward or&nbsp;<A NAME="34"></A>result
which flows from them?&nbsp;<A NAME="35"></A>

<P>There is, I said, this third class also. But why do you&nbsp;<A NAME="36"></A>ask?&nbsp;<A NAME="37"></A>
<BR>Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place&nbsp;<A NAME="38"></A>justice?&nbsp;<A NAME="39"></A>

<P>In the highest class, I replied, --among those goods which he who&nbsp;<A NAME="40"></A>would
be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their&nbsp;<A NAME="41"></A>results.&nbsp;<A NAME="42"></A>

<P>Then the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to&nbsp;<A NAME="43"></A>be
reckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued&nbsp;<A NAME="44"></A>for
the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are disagreeable&nbsp;<A NAME="45"></A>and
rather to be avoided.&nbsp;<A NAME="46"></A>

<P>I know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that&nbsp;<A NAME="47"></A>this
was the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he&nbsp;<A NAME="48"></A>censured
justice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be convinced&nbsp;<A NAME="49"></A>by
him.&nbsp;<A NAME="50"></A>

<P>I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then&nbsp;<A NAME="51"></A>I
shall see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like&nbsp;<A NAME="52"></A>a
snake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have&nbsp;<A NAME="53"></A>been;
but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been&nbsp;<A NAME="54"></A>made
clear. Setting aside their rewards and results, I want to know what&nbsp;<A NAME="55"></A>they
are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the soul. If you,&nbsp;<A NAME="56"></A>please,
then, I will revive the argument of Thrasymachus. And first I will&nbsp;<A NAME="57"></A>speak
of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view&nbsp;<A NAME="58"></A>of
them. Secondly, I will show that all men who practise justice do so&nbsp;<A NAME="59"></A>against
their will, of necessity, but not as a good. And thirdly, I will&nbsp;<A NAME="60"></A>argue
that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust is&nbsp;<A NAME="61"></A>after
all better far than the life of the just --if what they say is true,&nbsp;<A NAME="62"></A>Socrates,
since I myself am not of their opinion. But still I acknowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="63"></A>that
I am perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads&nbsp;<A NAME="64"></A>of
others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have never yet&nbsp;<A NAME="65"></A>heard
the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in&nbsp;<A NAME="66"></A>a
satisfactory way. I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself;&nbsp;<A NAME="67"></A>then
I shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom I think that&nbsp;<A NAME="68"></A>I
am most likely to hear this; and therefore I will praise the unjust life&nbsp;<A NAME="69"></A>to
the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking will indicate the&nbsp;<A NAME="70"></A>manner
in which I desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring&nbsp;<A NAME="71"></A>injustice.
Will you say whether you approve of my proposal?&nbsp;<A NAME="72"></A>

<P>Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense&nbsp;<A NAME="73"></A>would
oftener wish to converse.&nbsp;<A NAME="74"></A>

<P>I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin&nbsp;<A NAME="75"></A>by
speaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of&nbsp;<A NAME="76"></A>justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="77"></A>

<P>Glaucon&nbsp;<A NAME="78"></A>

<P>They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,&nbsp;<A NAME="79"></A>evil;
but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have&nbsp;<A NAME="80"></A>both
done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being&nbsp;<A NAME="81"></A>able
to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better&nbsp;<A NAME="82"></A>agree
among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual&nbsp;<A NAME="83"></A>covenants;
and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and&nbsp;<A NAME="84"></A>just.
This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice; --it is&nbsp;<A NAME="85"></A>a
mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="86"></A>and
not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice&nbsp;<A NAME="87"></A>without
the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point&nbsp;<A NAME="88"></A>between
the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and&nbsp;<A NAME="89"></A>honoured
by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. For no man&nbsp;<A NAME="90"></A>who
is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement&nbsp;<A NAME="91"></A>if
he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received&nbsp;<A NAME="92"></A>account,
Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="93"></A>

<P>Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because&nbsp;<A NAME="94"></A>they
have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something&nbsp;<A NAME="95"></A>of
this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do&nbsp;<A NAME="96"></A>what
they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them; then&nbsp;<A NAME="97"></A>we
shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding&nbsp;<A NAME="98"></A>along
the same road, following their interest, which all natures deem to&nbsp;<A NAME="99"></A>be
their good, and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force&nbsp;<A NAME="100"></A>of
law. The liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given&nbsp;<A NAME="101"></A>to
them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by&nbsp;<A NAME="102"></A>Gyges
the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian. According to the tradition, Gyges&nbsp;<A NAME="103"></A>was
a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm,&nbsp;<A NAME="104"></A>and
an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was&nbsp;<A NAME="105"></A>feeding
his flock. Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening,&nbsp;<A NAME="106"></A>where,
among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors,&nbsp;<A NAME="107"></A>at
which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared&nbsp;<A NAME="108"></A>to
him, more than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he&nbsp;<A NAME="109"></A>took
from the finger of the dead and reascended. Now the shepherds met&nbsp;<A NAME="110"></A>together,
according to custom, that they might send their monthly report&nbsp;<A NAME="111"></A>about
the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring&nbsp;<A NAME="112"></A>on
his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the&nbsp;<A NAME="113"></A>collet
of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible&nbsp;<A NAME="114"></A>to
the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were&nbsp;<A NAME="115"></A>no
longer present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring&nbsp;<A NAME="116"></A>he
turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of&nbsp;<A NAME="117"></A>the
ring, and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards&nbsp;<A NAME="118"></A>he
became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived&nbsp;<A NAME="119"></A>to
be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court; where as&nbsp;<A NAME="120"></A>soon
as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help conspired against&nbsp;<A NAME="121"></A>the
king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now that there were&nbsp;<A NAME="122"></A>two
such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the&nbsp;<A NAME="123"></A>other;,no
man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would&nbsp;<A NAME="124"></A>stand
fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his&nbsp;<A NAME="125"></A>own
when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into&nbsp;<A NAME="126"></A>houses
and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison&nbsp;<A NAME="127"></A>whom
he would, and in all respects be like a God among men. Then the actions&nbsp;<A NAME="128"></A>of
the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come&nbsp;<A NAME="129"></A>at
last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof&nbsp;<A NAME="130"></A>that
a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is&nbsp;<A NAME="131"></A>any
good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks&nbsp;<A NAME="132"></A>that
he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in&nbsp;<A NAME="133"></A>their
hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than&nbsp;<A NAME="134"></A>justice,
and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they&nbsp;<A NAME="135"></A>are
right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming&nbsp;<A NAME="136"></A>invisible,
and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he&nbsp;<A NAME="137"></A>would
be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although&nbsp;<A NAME="138"></A>they
would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with&nbsp;<A NAME="139"></A>one
another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice. Enough of&nbsp;<A NAME="140"></A>this.&nbsp;<A NAME="141"></A>

<P>Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just&nbsp;<A NAME="142"></A>and
unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the&nbsp;<A NAME="143"></A>isolation
to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust,&nbsp;<A NAME="144"></A>and
the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either&nbsp;<A NAME="145"></A>of
them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective&nbsp;<A NAME="146"></A>lives.
First, let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft;&nbsp;<A NAME="147"></A>like
the skilful pilot or physician, who knows intuitively his own powers&nbsp;<A NAME="148"></A>and
keeps within their limits, and who, if he fails at any point, is able&nbsp;<A NAME="149"></A>to
recover himself. So let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right&nbsp;<A NAME="150"></A>way,
and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice (he who is&nbsp;<A NAME="151"></A>found
out is nobody): for the highest reach of injustice is: to be deemed&nbsp;<A NAME="152"></A>just
when you are not. Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man&nbsp;<A NAME="153"></A>we
must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction,&nbsp;<A NAME="154"></A>but
we must allow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired&nbsp;<A NAME="155"></A>the
greatest reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step he must&nbsp;<A NAME="156"></A>be
able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if&nbsp;<A NAME="157"></A>any
of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is&nbsp;<A NAME="158"></A>required
his courage and strength, and command of money and friends. And&nbsp;<A NAME="159"></A>at
his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity,&nbsp;<A NAME="160"></A>wishing,
as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. There must be no&nbsp;<A NAME="161"></A>seeming,
for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and&nbsp;<A NAME="162"></A>then
we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for&nbsp;<A NAME="163"></A>the
sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in justice&nbsp;<A NAME="164"></A>only,
and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a state of&nbsp;<A NAME="165"></A>life
the opposite of the former. Let him be the best of men, and let him&nbsp;<A NAME="166"></A>be
thought the worst; then he will have been put to the proof; and we shall&nbsp;<A NAME="167"></A>see
whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences.&nbsp;<A NAME="168"></A>And
let him continue thus to the hour of death; being just and seeming&nbsp;<A NAME="169"></A>to
be unjust. When both have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of&nbsp;<A NAME="170"></A>justice
and the other of injustice, let judgment be given which of them&nbsp;<A NAME="171"></A>is
the happier of the two.&nbsp;<A NAME="172"></A>

<P>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<A NAME="173"></A>

<P>Heavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish&nbsp;<A NAME="174"></A>them
up for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were&nbsp;<A NAME="175"></A>two
statues.&nbsp;<A NAME="176"></A>

<P>I do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like&nbsp;<A NAME="177"></A>there
is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either&nbsp;<A NAME="178"></A>of
them. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the description&nbsp;<A NAME="179"></A>a
little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that the words which&nbsp;<A NAME="180"></A>follow
are not mine. --Let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists&nbsp;<A NAME="181"></A>of
injustice: They will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="182"></A>will
be scourged, racked, bound --will have his eyes burnt out; and, at&nbsp;<A NAME="183"></A>last,
after suffering every kind of evil, he will be impaled: Then he will&nbsp;<A NAME="184"></A>understand
that he ought to seem only, and not to be, just; the words of&nbsp;<A NAME="185"></A>Aeschylus
may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just. For&nbsp;<A NAME="186"></A>the
unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not live with a view to appearances&nbsp;<A NAME="187"></A>--he
wants to be really unjust and not to seem only:--&nbsp;<A NAME="188"></A>

<P>His mind has a soil deep and fertile,&nbsp;<A NAME="189"></A>
<BR>Out of which spring his prudent counsels. In the first place, he is&nbsp;<A NAME="190"></A>thought
just, and therefore bears rule in the city; he can marry whom he&nbsp;<A NAME="191"></A>will,
and give in marriage to whom he will; also he can trade and deal&nbsp;<A NAME="192"></A>where
he likes, and always to his own advantage, because he has no misgivings&nbsp;<A NAME="193"></A>about
injustice and at every contest, whether in public or private, he&nbsp;<A NAME="194"></A>gets
the better of his antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is&nbsp;<A NAME="195"></A>rich,
and out of his gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies;&nbsp;<A NAME="196"></A>moreover,
he can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly&nbsp;<A NAME="197"></A>and
magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to&nbsp;<A NAME="198"></A>honour
in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely&nbsp;<A NAME="199"></A>to
be dearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men&nbsp;<A NAME="200"></A>are
said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life&nbsp;<A NAME="201"></A>of
the just.&nbsp;<A NAME="202"></A>

<P>Adeimantus -SOCRATES&nbsp;<A NAME="203"></A>

<P>I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus,&nbsp;<A NAME="204"></A>his
brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there&nbsp;<A NAME="205"></A>is
nothing more to be urged?&nbsp;<A NAME="206"></A>

<P>Why, what else is there? I answered.&nbsp;<A NAME="207"></A>
<BR>The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he&nbsp;<A NAME="208"></A>replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="209"></A>
<BR>Well, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother' --if&nbsp;<A NAME="210"></A>he
fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that Glaucon&nbsp;<A NAME="211"></A>has
already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take from me the&nbsp;<A NAME="212"></A>power
of helping justice.&nbsp;<A NAME="213"></A>

<P>Adeimantus&nbsp;<A NAME="214"></A>

<P>Nonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is another&nbsp;<A NAME="215"></A>side
to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice and&nbsp;<A NAME="216"></A>injustice,
which is equally required in order to bring out what I believe&nbsp;<A NAME="217"></A>to
be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their sons and&nbsp;<A NAME="218"></A>their
wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake of justice,&nbsp;<A NAME="219"></A>but
for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of obtaining&nbsp;<A NAME="220"></A>for
him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages, and the like&nbsp;<A NAME="221"></A>which
Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="222"></A>from
the reputation of justice. More, however, is made of appearances by&nbsp;<A NAME="223"></A>this
class of persons than by the others; for they throw in the good opinion&nbsp;<A NAME="224"></A>of
the gods, and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens,&nbsp;<A NAME="225"></A>as
they say, rain upon the pious; and this accords with the testimony of&nbsp;<A NAME="226"></A>the
noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of whom says, that the gods make&nbsp;<A NAME="227"></A>the
oaks of the just--&nbsp;<A NAME="228"></A>

<P>To hear acorns at their summit, and bees I the&nbsp;<A NAME="229"></A>middle;&nbsp;<A NAME="230"></A>
<BR>And the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces. and&nbsp;<A NAME="231"></A>many
other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And Homer has&nbsp;<A NAME="232"></A>a
very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame&nbsp;<A NAME="233"></A>is--&nbsp;<A NAME="234"></A>

<P>As the fame of some blameless king who, like a&nbsp;<A NAME="235"></A>god,&nbsp;<A NAME="236"></A>
<BR>Maintains justice to whom the black earth brings&nbsp;<A NAME="237"></A>forth&nbsp;<A NAME="238"></A>
<BR>Wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit,&nbsp;<A NAME="239"></A>
<BR>And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish. Still&nbsp;<A NAME="240"></A>grander
are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe to&nbsp;<A NAME="241"></A>the
just; they take them down into the world below, where they have the&nbsp;<A NAME="242"></A>saints
lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk, crowned with garlands;&nbsp;<A NAME="243"></A>their
idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest&nbsp;<A NAME="244"></A>meed
of virtue. Some extend their rewards yet further; the posterity, as&nbsp;<A NAME="245"></A>they
say, of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth&nbsp;<A NAME="246"></A>generation.
This is the style in which they praise justice. But about the&nbsp;<A NAME="247"></A>wicked
there is another strain; they bury them in a slough in Hades, and&nbsp;<A NAME="248"></A>make
them carry water in a sieve; also while they are yet living they bring&nbsp;<A NAME="249"></A>them
to infamy, and inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described&nbsp;<A NAME="250"></A>as
the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does&nbsp;<A NAME="251"></A>their
invention supply. Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring&nbsp;<A NAME="252"></A>the
other.&nbsp;<A NAME="253"></A>

<P>Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of&nbsp;<A NAME="254"></A>speaking
about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets,&nbsp;<A NAME="255"></A>but
is found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always&nbsp;<A NAME="256"></A>declaring
that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and toilsome;&nbsp;<A NAME="257"></A>and
that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment, and&nbsp;<A NAME="258"></A>are
only censured by law and opinion. They say also that honesty is for&nbsp;<A NAME="259"></A>the
most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they are quite ready&nbsp;<A NAME="260"></A>to
call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in public and private&nbsp;<A NAME="261"></A>when
they are rich or in any other way influential, while they despise&nbsp;<A NAME="262"></A>and
overlook those who may be weak and poor, even though acknowledging&nbsp;<A NAME="263"></A>them
to be better than the others. But most extraordinary of all is their&nbsp;<A NAME="264"></A>mode
of speaking about virtue and the gods: they say that the gods apportion&nbsp;<A NAME="265"></A>calamity
and misery to many good men, and good and happiness to the wicked.&nbsp;<A NAME="266"></A>And
mendicant prophets go to rich men's doors and persuade them that they&nbsp;<A NAME="267"></A>have
a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a&nbsp;<A NAME="268"></A>man's
own or his ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings&nbsp;<A NAME="269"></A>and
feasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust,&nbsp;<A NAME="270"></A>at
a small cost; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they&nbsp;<A NAME="271"></A>say,
to execute their will. And the poets are the authorities to whom they&nbsp;<A NAME="272"></A>appeal,
now smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod;&nbsp;<A NAME="273"></A>--&nbsp;<A NAME="274"></A>

<P>Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth&nbsp;<A NAME="275"></A>and
her dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil,&nbsp;<A NAME="276"></A>and
a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that the&nbsp;<A NAME="277"></A>gods
may be influenced by men; for he also says:&nbsp;<A NAME="278"></A>

<P>The gods, too, may he turned from their purpose; and men pray to&nbsp;<A NAME="279"></A>them
and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by&nbsp;<A NAME="280"></A>libations
and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed.&nbsp;<A NAME="281"></A>And
they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who were&nbsp;<A NAME="282"></A>children
of the Moon and the Muses --that is what they say --according&nbsp;<A NAME="283"></A>to
which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals,&nbsp;<A NAME="284"></A>but
whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by&nbsp;<A NAME="285"></A>sacrifices
and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at&nbsp;<A NAME="286"></A>the
service of the living and the dead; the latter sort they call mysteries,&nbsp;<A NAME="287"></A>and
they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect them no one&nbsp;<A NAME="288"></A>knows
what awaits us.&nbsp;<A NAME="289"></A>

<P>He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="290"></A>and
vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their&nbsp;<A NAME="291"></A>minds
likely to be affected, my dear Socrates, --those of them, I mean,&nbsp;<A NAME="292"></A>who
are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower,&nbsp;<A NAME="293"></A>and
from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner&nbsp;<A NAME="294"></A>of
persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would&nbsp;<A NAME="295"></A>make
the best of life? Probably the youth will say to himself in the words&nbsp;<A NAME="296"></A>of
Pindar--&nbsp;<A NAME="297"></A>

<P>Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier&nbsp;<A NAME="298"></A>tower
which may he a fortress to me all my days? For what men say is that,&nbsp;<A NAME="299"></A>if
I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none,&nbsp;<A NAME="300"></A>but
the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable. But if, though&nbsp;<A NAME="301"></A>unjust,
I acquire the reputation of justice, a heavenly life is promised&nbsp;<A NAME="302"></A>to
me. Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth&nbsp;<A NAME="303"></A>and
is lord of happiness, to appearance I must devote myself. I will describe&nbsp;<A NAME="304"></A>around
me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior&nbsp;<A NAME="305"></A>of
my house; behind I will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus,&nbsp;<A NAME="306"></A>greatest
of sages, recommends. But I hear some one exclaiming that the&nbsp;<A NAME="307"></A>concealment
of wickedness is often difficult; to which I answer, Nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="308"></A>great
is easy. Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we would be&nbsp;<A NAME="309"></A>happy,
to be the path along which we should proceed. With a view to concealment&nbsp;<A NAME="310"></A>we
will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs. And there are&nbsp;<A NAME="311"></A>professors
of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies;&nbsp;<A NAME="312"></A>and
so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall make unlawful&nbsp;<A NAME="313"></A>gains
and not be punished. Still I hear a voice saying that the gods cannot&nbsp;<A NAME="314"></A>be
deceived, neither can they be compelled. But what if there are no gods?&nbsp;<A NAME="315"></A>or,
suppose them to have no care of human things --why in either case should&nbsp;<A NAME="316"></A>we
mind about concealment? And even if there are gods, and they do care&nbsp;<A NAME="317"></A>about
us, yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of&nbsp;<A NAME="318"></A>the
poets; and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced&nbsp;<A NAME="319"></A>and
turned by 'sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings.' Let&nbsp;<A NAME="320"></A>us
be consistent then, and believe both or neither. If the poets speak&nbsp;<A NAME="321"></A>truly,
why then we had better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice;&nbsp;<A NAME="322"></A>for
if we are just, although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we&nbsp;<A NAME="323"></A>shall
lose the gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep&nbsp;<A NAME="324"></A>the
gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning, the&nbsp;<A NAME="325"></A>gods
will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished. 'But there is a&nbsp;<A NAME="326"></A>world
below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust&nbsp;<A NAME="327"></A>deeds.'
Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there are mysteries&nbsp;<A NAME="328"></A>and
atoning deities, and these have great power. That is what mighty cities&nbsp;<A NAME="329"></A>declare;
and the children of the gods, who were their poets and prophets,&nbsp;<A NAME="330"></A>bear
a like testimony.&nbsp;<A NAME="331"></A>

<P>On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather&nbsp;<A NAME="332"></A>than
the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful&nbsp;<A NAME="333"></A>regard
to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men,&nbsp;<A NAME="334"></A>in
life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest authorities&nbsp;<A NAME="335"></A>tell
us. Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has any superiority&nbsp;<A NAME="336"></A>of
mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour justice; or indeed&nbsp;<A NAME="337"></A>to
refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised? And even if there&nbsp;<A NAME="338"></A>should
be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words, and who&nbsp;<A NAME="339"></A>is
satisfied that justice is best, still he is not angry with the unjust,&nbsp;<A NAME="340"></A>but
is very ready to forgive them, because he also knows that men are not&nbsp;<A NAME="341"></A>just
of their own free will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom&nbsp;<A NAME="342"></A>the
divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or&nbsp;<A NAME="343"></A>who
has attained knowledge of the truth --but no other man. He only blames&nbsp;<A NAME="344"></A>injustice
who, owing to cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the&nbsp;<A NAME="345"></A>power
of being unjust. And this is proved by the fact that when he obtains&nbsp;<A NAME="346"></A>the
power, he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can&nbsp;<A NAME="347"></A>be.&nbsp;<A NAME="348"></A>

<P>The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning&nbsp;<A NAME="349"></A>of
the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were&nbsp;<A NAME="350"></A>to
find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice --beginning with&nbsp;<A NAME="351"></A>the
ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and ending&nbsp;<A NAME="352"></A>with
the men of our own time --no one has ever blamed injustice or praised&nbsp;<A NAME="353"></A>justice
except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits which&nbsp;<A NAME="354"></A>flow
from them. No one has ever adequately described either in verse or&nbsp;<A NAME="355"></A>prose
the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul,&nbsp;<A NAME="356"></A>and
invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of all the things&nbsp;<A NAME="357"></A>of
a man's soul which he has within him, justice is the greatest good,&nbsp;<A NAME="358"></A>and
injustice the greatest evil. Had this been the universal strain, had&nbsp;<A NAME="359"></A>you
sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards, we should not&nbsp;<A NAME="360"></A>have
been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong, but every&nbsp;<A NAME="361"></A>one
would have been his own watchman, because afraid, if he did wrong,&nbsp;<A NAME="362"></A>of
harbouring in himself the greatest of evils. I dare say that Thrasymachus&nbsp;<A NAME="363"></A>and
others would seriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating,&nbsp;<A NAME="364"></A>and
words even stronger than these about justice and injustice, grossly,&nbsp;<A NAME="365"></A>as
I conceive, perverting their true nature. But I speak in this vehement&nbsp;<A NAME="366"></A>manner,
as I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from you&nbsp;<A NAME="367"></A>the
opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority&nbsp;<A NAME="368"></A>which
justice has over injustice, but what effect they have on the possessor&nbsp;<A NAME="369"></A>of
them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him.&nbsp;<A NAME="370"></A>And
please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations; for unless&nbsp;<A NAME="371"></A>you
take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false,&nbsp;<A NAME="372"></A>we
shall say that you do not praise justice, but the appearance of it;&nbsp;<A NAME="373"></A>we
shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark, and&nbsp;<A NAME="374"></A>that
you really agree with Thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another's&nbsp;<A NAME="375"></A>good
and the interest of the stronger, and that injustice is a man's own&nbsp;<A NAME="376"></A>profit
and interest, though injurious to the weaker. Now as you have admitted&nbsp;<A NAME="377"></A>that
justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed&nbsp;<A NAME="378"></A>for
their results, but in a far greater degree for their own sakes --like&nbsp;<A NAME="379"></A>sight
or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural&nbsp;<A NAME="380"></A>and
not merely conventional good --I would ask you in your praise of justice&nbsp;<A NAME="381"></A>to
regard one point only: I mean the essential good and evil which justice&nbsp;<A NAME="382"></A>and
injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others praise justice&nbsp;<A NAME="383"></A>and
censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and&nbsp;<A NAME="384"></A>abusing
the other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them,&nbsp;<A NAME="385"></A>I
am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in&nbsp;<A NAME="386"></A>the
consideration of this question, unless I hear the contrary from your&nbsp;<A NAME="387"></A>own
lips, I expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only prove&nbsp;<A NAME="388"></A>to
us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they either&nbsp;<A NAME="389"></A>of
them do to the possessor of them, which makes the one to be a good and&nbsp;<A NAME="390"></A>the
other an evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and&nbsp;<A NAME="391"></A>men.&nbsp;<A NAME="392"></A>

<P>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS&nbsp;<A NAME="393"></A>

<P>I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but&nbsp;<A NAME="394"></A>on
hearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an illustrious&nbsp;<A NAME="395"></A>father,
that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the admirer&nbsp;<A NAME="396"></A>of
Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves&nbsp;<A NAME="397"></A>at
the battle of Megara:--&nbsp;<A NAME="398"></A>

<P>'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious&nbsp;<A NAME="399"></A>hero.'
The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine&nbsp;<A NAME="400"></A>in
being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice,&nbsp;<A NAME="401"></A>and
remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. And I do believe that&nbsp;<A NAME="402"></A>you
are not convinced --this I infer from your general character, for had&nbsp;<A NAME="403"></A>I
judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But now,&nbsp;<A NAME="404"></A>the
greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in knowing&nbsp;<A NAME="405"></A>what
to say. For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand I feel that&nbsp;<A NAME="406"></A>I
am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to me by the&nbsp;<A NAME="407"></A>fact
that you were not satisfied with the answer which I made to Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<A NAME="408"></A>proving,
as I thought, the superiority which justice has over injustice.&nbsp;<A NAME="409"></A>And
yet I cannot refuse to help, while breath and speech remain to me;&nbsp;<A NAME="410"></A>I
am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice&nbsp;<A NAME="411"></A>is
evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence. And therefore&nbsp;<A NAME="412"></A>I
had best give such help as I can.&nbsp;<A NAME="413"></A>

<P>Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question&nbsp;<A NAME="414"></A>drop,
but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the&nbsp;<A NAME="415"></A>truth,
first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,&nbsp;<A NAME="416"></A>about
their relative advantages. I told them, what I --really thought,&nbsp;<A NAME="417"></A>that
the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very good&nbsp;<A NAME="418"></A>eyes.
Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that we had&nbsp;<A NAME="419"></A>better
adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that a short-sighted&nbsp;<A NAME="420"></A>person
had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance;&nbsp;<A NAME="421"></A>and
it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place&nbsp;<A NAME="422"></A>which
was larger and in which the letters were larger --if they were the&nbsp;<A NAME="423"></A>same
and he could read the larger letters first, and then proceed to the&nbsp;<A NAME="424"></A>lesser
--this would have been thought a rare piece of good&nbsp;<A NAME="425"></A>fortune.&nbsp;<A NAME="426"></A>

<P>Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply&nbsp;<A NAME="427"></A>to
our enquiry?&nbsp;<A NAME="428"></A>

<P>I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our&nbsp;<A NAME="429"></A>enquiry,
is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual,&nbsp;<A NAME="430"></A>and
sometimes as the virtue of a State.&nbsp;<A NAME="431"></A>

<P>True, he replied.&nbsp;<A NAME="432"></A>
<BR>And is not a State larger than an individual?&nbsp;<A NAME="433"></A>
<BR>It is.&nbsp;<A NAME="434"></A>
<BR>Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and&nbsp;<A NAME="435"></A>more
easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature&nbsp;<A NAME="436"></A>of
justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and secondly&nbsp;<A NAME="437"></A>in
the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing&nbsp;<A NAME="438"></A>them.&nbsp;<A NAME="439"></A>

<P>That, he said, is an excellent proposal.&nbsp;<A NAME="440"></A>
<BR>And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the&nbsp;<A NAME="441"></A>justice
and injustice of the State in process of creation&nbsp;<A NAME="442"></A>also.&nbsp;<A NAME="443"></A>

<P>I dare say.&nbsp;<A NAME="444"></A>
<BR>When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of&nbsp;<A NAME="445"></A>our
search will be more easily discovered.&nbsp;<A NAME="446"></A>
<DIV ALIGN=right>Yes, far more easily.&nbsp;<A NAME="447"></A></DIV>
