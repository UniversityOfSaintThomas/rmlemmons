      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P align=left><I>Mr. President, <BR>Ladies and Gentlemen,</I></P>
      <P align=left>1. It is an honour for me to have the opportunity to address 
      this international Assembly and to join the men and women of every 
      country, race, language and culture in celebrating the fiftieth 
      anniversary of the founding of the United Nations Organization. In coming 
      before this distinguished Assembly, I am vividly aware that through you I 
      am in some way addressing the whole family of peoples living on the face 
      of the earth. My words are meant as a sign of the interest and esteem of 
      the Apostolic See and of the Catholic Church for this Institution. They 
      echo the voices of all those who see in the United Nations the hope of a 
      better future for human society.</P>
      <P align=left>I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude in the first place 
      to the Secretary General, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for having warmly 
      encouraged this visit. And I thank you, Mr. President, for your cordial 
      welcome. I greet all of you, the members of this General Assembly: I am 
      grateful for your presence and for your kind attention.</P>
      <P align=left>I come before you today with the desire to be able to 
      contribute to that thoughtful meditation on the history and role of this 
      Organization which should accompany and give substance to the anniversary 
      celebrations. The Holy See, in virtue of its specifically spiritual 
      mission, which makes it concerned for the integral good of every human 
      being, has supported the ideals and goals of the United Nations 
      Organization from the very beginning. Although their respective purposes 
      and operative approaches are obviously different, the Church and the 
      United Nations constantly find wide areas of cooperation on the basis of 
      their common concern for the human family. It is this awareness which 
      inspires my thoughts today; they will not dwell on any particular social, 
      political, or economic question; rather, I would like to reflect with you 
      on what the extraordinary changes of the last few years imply, not simply 
      for the present, but for the future of the whole human family.</P>
      <P align=left><B><I>A Common Human Patrimony</I></B></P>
      <P align=left>2. Ladies and Gentlemen! On the threshold of a new 
      millennium we are witnessing an extraordinary global acceleration of that 
      quest for freedom which is one of the great dynamics of human history. 
      This phenomenon is not limited to any one part of the world; nor is it the 
      expression of any single culture. Men and women throughout the world, even 
      when threatened by violence, have taken the risk of freedom, asking to be 
      given a place in social, political, and economic life which is 
      commensurate with their dignity as free human beings. This universal 
      longing for freedom is truly one of the distinguishing marks of our 
      time.</P>
      <P align=left>During my previous Visit to the United Nations on 2 October 
      1979, I noted that the quest for freedom in our time has its basis in 
      those universal rights which human beings enjoy by the very fact of their 
      humanity. It was precisely outrages against human dignity which led the 
      United Nations Organization to formulate, barely three years after its 
      establishment, that Universal Declaration of Human Rights which remains 
      one of the highest expressions of the human conscience of our time. In 
      Asia and Africa, in the Americas, in Oceania and Europe, men and women of 
      conviction and courage have appealed to this Declaration in support of 
      their claims for a fuller share in the life of society.</P>
      <P align=left>3. It is important for us to grasp what might be called the 
      inner structure of this worldwide movement. It is precisely its global 
      character which offers us its first and fundamental "key" and confirms 
      that there are indeed universal human rights, rooted in the nature of the 
      person, rights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of a 
      universal moral law. These are not abstract points; rather, these rights 
      tell us something important about the actual life of every individual and 
      of every social group. They also remind us that we do not live in an 
      irrational or meaningless world. On the contrary, there is a moral logic 
      which is built into human life and which makes possible dialogue between 
      individuals and peoples. If we want a century of violent coercion to be 
      succeeded by a century of persuasion, we must find a way to discuss the 
      human future intelligibly. The universal moral law written on the human 
      heart is precisely that kind of "grammar" which is needed if the world is 
      to engage this discussion of its future.</P>
      <P align=left>In this sense, it is a matter for serious concern that some 
      people today deny the universality of human rights, just as they deny that 
      there is a human nature shared by everyone. To be sure, there is no single 
      model for organizing the politics and economics of human freedom; 
      different cultures and different historical experiences give rise to 
      different institutional forms of public life in a free and responsible 
      society. But it is one thing to affirm a legitimate pluralism of "forms of 
      freedom", and another to deny any universality or intelligibility to the 
      nature of man or to the human experience. The latter makes the 
      international politics of persuasion extremely difficult, if not 
      impossible.</P>
      <P align=left><B><I>Taking the Risk of Freedom</I></B></P>
      <P align=left>4. The moral dynamics of this universal quest for freedom 
      clearly appeared in Central and Eastern Europe during the non-violent 
      revolutions of 1989. Unfolding in specific times and places, those 
      historical events nonetheless taught a lesson which goes far beyond a 
      specific geographical location. For the non-violent revolutions of 1989 
      demonstrated that the quest for freedom cannot be suppressed. It arises 
      from a recognition of the inestimable dignity and value of the human 
      person, and it cannot fail to be accompanied by a commitment on behalf of 
      the human person. Modern totalitarianism has been, first and foremost, an 
      assault on the dignity of the person, an assault which has gone even to 
      the point of denying the inalienable value of the individual's life. The 
      revolutions of 1989 were made possible by the commitment of brave men and 
      women inspired by a different, and ultimately more profound and powerful, 
      vision: the vision of man as a creature of intelligence and free will, 
      immersed in a mystery which transcends his own being and endowed with the 
      ability to reflect and the ability to choose — and thus capable of wisdom 
      and virtue. A decisive factor in the success of those non-violent 
      revolutions was the experience of social solidarity: in the face of 
      regimes backed by the power of propaganda and terror, that solidarity was 
      the moral core of the "power of the powerless", a beacon of hope and an 
      enduring reminder that it is possible for man's historical journey to 
      follow a path which is true to the finest aspirations of the human 
      spirit.</P>
      <P align=left>Viewing those events from this privileged international 
      forum, one cannot fail to grasp the connection between the values which 
      inspired those people's liberation movements and many of the moral 
      commitments inscribed in the United Nations Charter: I am thinking for 
      example of the commitment to "reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights 
      (and) in the dignity and worth of the human person"; and also the 
      commitment "to promote social progress and better standards of life in 
      larger freedom" (Preamble). The fifty-one States which founded this 
      Organization in 1945 truly lit a lamp whose light can scatter the darkness 
      caused by tyranny — a light which can show the way to freedom, peace, and 
      solidarity.</P>
      <P align=left><B><I>The Rights of Nations</I></B></P>
      <P align=left>5. The quest for freedom in the second half of the twentieth 
      century has engaged not only individuals but nations as well. Fifty years 
      after the end of the Second World War, it is important to remember that 
      that war was fought because of violations of the rights of nations. Many 
      of those nations suffered grievously for no other reason than that they 
      were deemed "other". Terrible crimes were committed in the name of lethal 
      doctrines which taught the "inferiority" of some nations and cultures. In 
      a certain sense, the United Nations Organization was born from a 
      conviction that such doctrines were antithetical to peace; and the 
      Charter's commitment to "save future generations from the scourge of war" 
      (Preamble) surely implied a moral commitment to defend every nation and 
      culture from unjust and violent aggression.</P>
      <P align=left>Unfortunately, even after the end of the Second World War, 
      the rights of nations continued to be violated. To take but one set of 
      examples, the Baltic States and extensive territories in Ukraine and 
      Belarus were absorbed into the Soviet Union, as had already happened to 
      Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia in the Caucasus. At the same time the 
      so-called "People's Democracies" of Central and Eastern Europe effectively 
      lost their sovereignty and were required to submit to the will dominating 
      the entire bloc. The result of this artificial division of Europe was the 
      "cold war", a situation of international tension in which the threat of a 
      nuclear holocaust hung over humanity. It was only when freedom was 
      restored to the nations of Central and Eastern Europe that the promise of 
      the peace which should have come with the end of the war began to be 
      realized for many of the victims of that conflict.</P>
      <P align=left>6. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 
      1948, spoke eloquently of the rights of persons; but no similar 
      international agreement has yet adequately addressed the rights of 
      nations. This situation must be carefully pondered, for it raises urgent 
      questions about justice and freedom in the world today.</P>
      <P align=left>In reality the problem of the full recognition of the rights 
      of peoples and nations has presented itself repeatedly to the conscience 
      of humanity, and has also given rise to considerable ethical and juridical 
      reflection. I am reminded of the debate which took place at the Council of 
      Constance in the fifteenth century, when the representatives of the 
      Academy of Krakow, headed by Pawel Wlodkowic, courageously defended the 
      right of certain European peoples to existence and independence. Still 
      better known is the discussion which went on in that same period at the 
      University of Salamanca with regard to the peoples of the New World. And 
      in our own century, how can I fail to mention the prophetic words of my 
      predecessor, Pope Benedict XV, who in the midst of the First World War 
      reminded everyone that "nations do not die", and invited them "to ponder 
      with serene conscience the rights and the just aspirations of peoples" 
      (<I>To the Peoples at War and their Leaders</I>, 28 July 1915)?</P>
      <P align=left>7. Today the problem of nationalities forms part of a new 
      world horizon marked by a great "mobility" which has blurred the ethnic 
      and cultural frontiers of the different peoples, as a result of a variety 
      of processes such as migrations, mass-media and the globalization of the 
      economy. And yet, precisely against this horizon of universality we see 
      the powerful re-emergence of a certain ethnic and cultural consciousness, 
      as it were an explosive need for identity and survival, a sort of 
      counterweight to the tendency toward uniformity. This is a phenomenon 
      which must not be underestimated or regarded as a simple left-over of the 
      past. It demands serious interpretation, and a closer examination on the 
      levels of anthropology, ethics and law.</P>
      <P align=left>This tension between the particular and the universal can be 
      considered immanent in human beings. By virtue of sharing in the same 
      human nature, people automatically feel that they are members of one great 
      family, as is in fact the case. But as a result of the concrete historical 
      conditioning of this same nature, they are necessarily bound in a more 
      intense way to particular human groups, beginning with the family and 
      going on to the various groups to which they belong and up to the whole of 
      their ethnic and cultural group, which is called, not by accident, a 
      "nation", from the Latin word "nasci": "to be born". This term, enriched 
      with another one, "patria" (fatherland/motherland), evokes the reality of 
      the family. The human condition thus finds itself between these two poles 
      — universality and particularity — with a vital tension between them; an 
      inevitable tension, but singularly fruitful if they are lived in a calm 
      and balanced way.</P>
      <P align=left>8. Upon this anthropological foundation there also rest the 
      "rights of nations", which are nothing but "human rights" fostered at the 
      specific level of community life. A study of these rights is certainly not 
      easy, if we consider the difficulty of defining the very concept of 
      "nation", which cannot be identified a priori and necessarily with the 
      State. Such a study must nonetheless be made, if we wish to avoid the 
      errors of the past and ensure a just world order.</P>
      <P align=left>A presupposition of a nation's rights is certainly its right 
      to exist: therefore no one — neither a State nor another nation, nor an 
      international organization — is ever justified in asserting that an 
      individual nation is not worthy of existence. This fundamental right to 
      existence does not necessarily call for sovereignty as a state, since 
      various forms of juridical aggregation between different nations are 
      possible, as for example occurs in Federal States, in Confederations or in 
      States characterized by broad regional autonomies. There can be historical 
      circumstances in which aggregations different from single state 
      sovereignty can even prove advisable, but only on condition that this 
      takes place in a climate of true freedom, guaranteed by the exercise of 
      the self-determination of the peoples concerned. Its right to exist 
      naturally implies that every nation also enjoys the right to its own 
      language and culture, through which a people expresses and promotes that 
      which I would call its fundamental spiritual "sovereignty". History shows 
      that in extreme circumstances (such as those which occurred in the land 
      where I was born) it is precisely its culture that enables a nation to 
      survive the loss of political and economic independence. Every nation 
      therefore has also the right to shape its life according to its own 
      traditions, excluding, of course, every abuse of basic human rights and in 
      particular the oppression of minorities. Every nation has the right to 
      build its future by providing an appropriate education for the younger 
      generation.</P>
      <P align=left>But while the "rights of the nation" express the vital 
      requirements of "particularity", it is no less important to emphasize the 
      requirements of universality, expressed through a clear awareness of the 
      duties which nations have vis-à-vis other nations and humanity as a whole. 
      Foremost among these duties is certainly that of living in a spirit of 
      peace, respect and solidarity with other nations. Thus the exercise of the 
      rights of nations, balanced by the acknowledgement and the practice of 
      duties, promotes a fruitful "exchange of gifts", which strengthens the 
      unity of all mankind.</P>
      <P align=left><B><I>Respect for Differences</I></B></P>
      <P align=left>9. During my pastoral pilgrimages to the communities of the 
      Catholic Church over the past seventeen years, I have been able to enter 
      into dialogue with the rich diversity of nations and cultures in every 
      part of the world. Unhappily, the world has yet to learn how to live with 
      diversity, as recent events in the Balkans and Central Africa have 
      painfully reminded us. The fact of "difference", and the reality of "the 
      other", can sometimes be felt as a burden, or even as a threat. Amplified 
      by historic grievances and exacerbated by the manipulations of the 
      unscrupulous, the fear of "difference" can lead to a denial of the very 
      humanity of "the other": with the result that people fall into a cycle of 
      violence in which no one is spared, not even the children. We are all very 
      familiar today with such situations; at this moment my heart and my 
      prayers turn in a special way to the sufferings of the sorely tried 
      peoples of Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
      <P align=left>From bitter experience, then, we know that the fear of 
      "difference", especially when it expresses itself in a narrow and 
      exclusive nationalism which denies any rights to "the other", can lead to 
      a true nightmare of violence and terror. And yet if we make the effort to 
      look at matters objectively, we can see that, transcending all the 
      differences which distinguish individuals and peoples, there is a 
      fundamental commonality. For different cultures are but different ways of 
      facing the question of the meaning of personal existence. And it is 
      precisely here that we find one source of the respect which is due to 
      every culture and every nation: every culture is an effort to ponder the 
      mystery of the world and in particular of the human person: it is a way of 
      giving expression to the transcendent dimension of human life. The heart 
      of every culture is its approach to the greatest of all mysteries: the 
      mystery of God.</P>
      <P align=left>10. Our respect for the culture of others is therefore 
      rooted in our respect for each community's attempt to answer the question 
      of human life. And here we can see how important it is to safeguard the 
      fundamental right to freedom of religion and freedom of conscience, as the 
      cornerstones of the structure of human rights and the foundation of every 
      truly free society. No one is permitted to suppress those rights by using 
      coercive power to impose an answer to the mystery of man.</P>
      <P align=left>To cut oneself off from the reality of difference — or, 
      worse, to attempt to stamp out that difference — is to cut oneself off 
      from the possibility of sounding the depths of the mystery of human life. 
      The truth about man is the unchangeable standard by which all cultures are 
      judged; but every culture has something to teach us about one or other 
      dimension of that complex truth. Thus the "difference" which some find so 
      threatening can, through respectful dialogue, become the source of a 
      deeper understanding of the mystery of human existence.</P>
      <P align=left>11. In this context, we need to clarify the essential 
      difference between an unhealthy form of nationalism, which teaches 
      contempt for other nations or cultures, and patriotism, which is a proper 
      love of one's country. True patriotism never seeks to advance the 
      well-being of one's own nation at the expense of others. For in the end 
      this would harm one's own nation as well: doing wrong damages both 
      aggressor and victim. Nationalism, particularly in its most radical forms, 
      is thus the antithesis of true patriotism, and today we must ensure that 
      extreme nationalism does not continue to give rise to new forms of the 
      aberrations of totalitarianism. This is a commitment which also holds 
      true, obviously, in cases where religion itself is made the basis of 
      nationalism, as unfortunately happens in certain manifestations of 
      so-called "fundamentalism". </P>
      <P align=left><B><I>Freedom and Moral Truth</I></B></P>
      <P align=left>12. Ladies and Gentlemen! Freedom is the measure of man's 
      dignity and greatness. Living the freedom sought by individuals and 
      peoples is a great challenge to man's spiritual growth and to the moral 
      vitality of nations. The basic question which we must all face today is 
      the responsible use of freedom, in both its personal and social 
      dimensions. Our reflection must turn then to the question of the moral 
      structure of freedom, which is the inner architecture of the culture of 
      freedom.</P>
      <P align=left>Freedom is not simply the absence of tyranny or oppression. 
      Nor is freedom a licence to do whatever we like. Freedom has an inner 
      "logic" which distinguishes it and ennobles it: freedom is ordered to the 
      truth, and is fulfilled in man's quest for truth and in man's living in 
      the truth. Detached from the truth about the human person, freedom 
      deteriorates into license in the lives of individuals, and, in political 
      life, it becomes the caprice of the most powerful and the arrogance of 
      power. Far from being a limitation upon freedom or a threat to it, 
      reference to the truth about the human person — a truth universally 
      knowable through the moral law written on the hearts of all — is, in fact, 
      the guarantor of freedom's future.</P>
      <P align=left>13. In the light of what has been said we understand how 
      utilitarianism, the doctrine which defines morality not in terms of what 
      is good but of what is advantageous, threatens the freedom of individuals 
      and nations and obstructs the building of a true culture of freedom. 
      Utilitarianism often has devastating political consequences, because it 
      inspires an aggressive nationalism on the basis of which the subjugation, 
      for example, of a smaller or weaker nation is claimed to be a good thing 
      solely because it corresponds to the national interest. No less grave are 
      the results of economic utilitarianism, which drives more powerful 
      countries to manipulate and exploit weaker ones.</P>
      <P align=left>Nationalistic and economic utilitarianism are sometimes 
      combined, a phenomenon which has too often characterized relations between 
      the "North" and the "South". For the emerging countries, the achievement 
      of political independence has too frequently been accompanied by a 
      situation of de facto economic dependence on other countries; indeed, in 
      some cases, the developing world has suffered a regression, such that some 
      countries lack the means of satisfying the essential needs of their 
      people. Such situations offend the conscience of humanity and pose a 
      formidable moral challenge to the human family. Meeting this challenge 
      will obviously require changes in both developing and developed countries. 
      If developing countries are able to offer sure guarantees of the proper 
      management of resources and of assistance received, as well as respect for 
      human rights, by replacing where necessary unjust, corrupt, or 
      authoritarian forms of government with participatory and democratic ones, 
      will they not in this way unleash the best civil and economic energies of 
      their people? And must not the developed countries, for their part, come 
      to renounce strictly utilitarian approaches and develop new approaches 
      inspired by greater justice and solidarity?</P>
      <P align=left>Yes, distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen! The international 
      economic scene needs an ethic of solidarity, if participation, economic 
      growth, and a just distribution of goods are to characterize the future of 
      humanity. The international cooperation called for by the Charter of the 
      United Nations for "solving international problems of an economic, social, 
      cultural, or humanitarian character" (art. 1.3) cannot be conceived 
      exclusively in terms of help and assistance, or even by considering the 
      eventual returns on the resources provided. When millions of people are 
      suffering from a poverty which means hunger, malnutrition, sickness, 
      illiteracy, and degradation, we must not only remind ourselves that no one 
      has a right to exploit another for his own advantage, but also and above 
      all we must recommit ourselves to that solidarity which enables others to 
      live out, in the actual circumstances of their economic and political 
      lives, the creativity which is a distinguishing mark of the human person 
      and the true source of the wealth of nations in today's world.</P>

      Freedom</I></B></P>
      <P align=left>14. As we face these enormous challenges, how can we fail to 
      acknowledge the role of the United Nations Organization? Fifty years after 
      its founding, the need for such an Organization is even more obvious, but 
      we also have a better understanding, on the basis of experience, that the 
      effectiveness of this great instrument for harmonizing and coordinating 
      international life depends on the international culture and ethic which it 
      supports and expresses. The United Nations Organization needs to rise more 
      and more above the cold status of an administrative institution and to 
      become a moral centre where all the nations of the world feel at home and 
      develop a shared awareness of being, as it were, a "family of nations". 
      The idea of "family" immediately evokes something more than simple 
      functional relations or a mere convergence of interests. The family is by 
      nature a community based on mutual trust, mutual support and sincere 
      respect. In an authentic family the strong do not dominate; instead, the 
      weaker members, because of their very weakness, are all the more welcomed 
      and served.</P>
      <P align=left>Raised to the level of the "family of nations", these 
      sentiments ought to be, even before law itself, the very fabric of 
      relations between peoples. The United Nations has the historic, even 
      momentous, task of promoting this qualitative leap in international life, 
      not only by serving as a centre of effective mediation for the resolution 
      of conflicts but also by fostering values, attitudes and concrete 
      initiatives of solidarity which prove capable of raising the level of 
      relations between nations from the "organizational" to a more "organic" 
      level, from simple "existence with" others to "existence for" others, in a 
      fruitful exchange of gifts, primarily for the good of the weaker nations 
      but even so, a clear harbinger of greater good for everyone.</P>
      <P align=left>15. Only on this condition shall we attain an end not only 
      to "wars of combat" but also to "cold wars". It will ensure not only the 
      legal equality of all peoples but also their active participation in the 
      building of a better future, and not only respect for individual cultural 
      identities, but full esteem for them as a common treasure belonging to the 
      cultural patrimony of mankind. Is this not the ideal held up by the 
      Charter of the United Nations when it sets as the basis of the 
      Organization "the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members" 
      (art. 2.1), or when it commits it to "develop friendly relations between 
      nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and of 
      self-determination" (art. 1.2)? This is the high road which must be 
      followed to the end, even if this involves, when necessary, appropriate 
      modifications in the operating model of the United Nations, so as to take 
      into account everything that has happened in this half century, with so 
      many new peoples experiencing freedom and legitimately aspiring to "be" 
      and to "count for" more.</P>
      <P align=left>None of this should appear an unattainable utopia. Now is 
      the time for new hope, which calls us to expel the paralyzing burden of 
      cynicism from the future of politics and of human life. The anniversary 
      which we are celebrating invites us to do this by reminding us of the idea 
      of "united nations", an idea which bespeaks mutual trust, security and 
      solidarity. Inspired by the example of all those who have taken the risk 
      of freedom, can we not recommit ourselves also to taking the risk of 
      solidarity — and thus the risk of peace?</P>
      <P align=left><B><I>Beyond Fear: the Civilization of Love</I></B></P>
      <P align=left>16. It is one of the great paradoxes of our time that man, 
      who began the period we call "modernity" with a self-confident assertion 
      of his "coming of age" and "autonomy", approaches the end of the twentieth 
      century fearful of himself, fearful of what he might be capable of, 
      fearful for the future. Indeed, the second half of the twentieth century 
      has seen the unprecedented phenomenon of a humanity uncertain about the 
      very likelihood of a future, given the threat of nuclear war. That danger, 
      mercifully, appears to have receded — and everything that might make it 
      return needs to be rejected firmly and universally; all the same, fear for 
      the future and of the future remains.</P>
      <P align=left>In order to ensure that the new millennium now approaching 
      will witness a new flourishing of the human spirit, mediated through an 
      authentic culture of freedom, men and women must learn to conquer fear. We 
      must learn not to be afraid, we must rediscover a spirit of hope and a 
      spirit of trust. Hope is not empty optimism springing from a naive 
      confidence that the future will necessarily be better than the past. Hope 
      and trust are the premise of responsible activity and are nurtured in that 
      inner sanctuary of conscience where "man is alone with God" (<A 
      href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html">Gaudium 
      et Spes</A>, 16) and he thus perceives that he is not alone amid the 
      enigmas of existence, for he is surrounded by the love of the Creator!</P>
      <P align=left>Hope and trust: these may seem matters beyond the purview of 
      the United Nations. But they are not. The politics of nations, with which 
      your Organization is principally concerned, can never ignore the 
      transcendent, spiritual dimension of the human experience, and could never 
      ignore it without harming the cause of man and the cause of human freedom. 
      Whatever diminishes man — whatever shortens the horizon of man's 
      aspiration to goodness — harms the cause of freedom. In order to recover 
      our hope and our trust at the end of this century of sorrows, we must 
      regain sight of that transcendent horizon of possibility to which the soul 
      of man aspires.</P>
      <P align=left>17. As a Christian, my hope and trust are centered on Jesus 
      Christ, the two thousandth anniversary of whose birth will be celebrated 
      at the coming of the new millennium. We Christians believe that in his 
      Death and Resurrection were fully revealed God's love and his care for all 
      creation. Jesus Christ is for us God made man, and made a part of the 
      history of humanity. Precisely for this reason, Christian hope for the 
      world and its future extends to every human person. Because of the radiant 
      humanity of Christ, nothing genuinely human fails to touch the hearts of 
      Christians. Faith in Christ does not impel us to intolerance. On the 
      contrary, it obliges us to engage others in a respectful dialogue. Love of 
      Christ does not distract us from interest in others, but rather invites us 
      to responsibility for them, to the exclusion of no one and indeed, if 
      anything, with a special concern for the weakest and the suffering. Thus, 
      as we approach the two thousandth anniversary of the birth of Christ, the 
      Church asks only to be able to propose respectfully this message of 
      salvation, and to be able to promote, in charity and service, the 
      solidarity of the entire human family.</P>
      <P align=left>Ladies and Gentlemen! I come before you, as did my 
      predecessor Pope Paul VI exactly thirty years ago, not as one who 
      exercises temporal power — these are his words — nor as a religious leader 
      seeking special privileges for his community. I come before you as a 
      witness: a witness to human dignity, a witness to hope, a witness to the 
      conviction that the destiny of all nations lies in the hands of a merciful 
      Providence.</P>
      <P align=left>18. We must overcome our fear of the future. But we will not 
      be able to overcome it completely unless we do so together. The "answer" 
      to that fear is neither coercion nor repression, nor the imposition of one 
      social "model" on the entire world. The answer to the fear which darkens 
      human existence at the end of the twentieth century is the common effort 
      to build the civilization of love, founded on the universal values of 
      peace, solidarity, justice, and liberty. And the "soul" of the 
      civilization of love is the culture of freedom: the freedom of individuals 
      and the freedom of nations, lived in self-giving solidarity and 
      responsibility.</P>
      <P align=left>We must not be afraid of the future. We must not be afraid 
      of man. It is no accident that we are here. Each and every human person 
      has been created in the "image and likeness" of the One who is the origin 
      of all that is. We have within us the capacities for wisdom and virtue. 
      With these gifts, and with the help of God's grace, we can build in the 
      next century and the next millennium a civilization worthy of the human 
      person, a true culture of freedom. We can and must do so! And in doing so, 
      we shall see that the tears of this century have prepared the ground for a 
      new springtime of the human spirit.</P>
