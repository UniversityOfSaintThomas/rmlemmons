BE CONCISE BUT MAKE ALL NECESSARY CONNECTIONS (length should be approximately
two typed pages total): (1) The dialogues of Plato contain arguments that
the friendship of lovers is worse than the friendship of non lovers. Explain
how Socrates/Plato argues this position and how Aquinas would argue against
it.&nbsp; (2) The chief problem for the Platonic understanding of love
is the problem of desire. If love is desire, then love is necessarily bent
upon self gratification; and, self gratification seems to involve selfishness
and treating the beloved as a means. How are Plato, Aristotle, Aelred and
Aquinas able to concede that love is desire while arguing that it need
not involve selfishness and treating the beloved as a means?&nbsp; (3)
Equality and reciprocity seem to be intrinsic to the the best forms of
interpersonal love. If this is the case, then friends receive what they
give and vice versa. How then is spousal friendship---within a traditional
relationship where the husband works and the wife cares for children---possible,
when the difference in functions means that neither receives what is given
and vice versa?&nbsp; Do the philosophers thus far studied offer<i> any</i>&nbsp;
way for enabling spouses to become great friends? (4) Aristotle argued
that friendship could not endure the distance between man and God; Aquinas
argued that friendship with God is possible. Imagine that Aristotle and
Aquinas were to meet in this life: how would Aristotle try to convince
Aquinas that friendship with God was impossible; how would Aquinas try
to convince Aristotle that friendship with God was possible?&nbsp; (5)
Racism and other forms of group prejudice express an attitude of &quot;us&quot; against
&quot;them.&quot;&nbsp; Aquinas argues that likeness is a cause of love; and so it
seems that racism as well as every form of group prejudice are loves caused
by the similarity of sharing some characteristic, e.g. race.&nbsp; Thus,
it seems that Thomistic thought provides no basis for overcoming racism
or any form of group prejudice.&nbsp; Explain how would Aquinas argue against
this pseudo-thomistic argument.</font></font></font></td>
