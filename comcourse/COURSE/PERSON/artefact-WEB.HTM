<P>This semester we have examined many issues concerning two
questions: What are we? What ought we strive for?  We have seen that
the answer to the second question reflects the first: materialists argue
that we ought to strive for the best comforts of this life, while dualists
and hylomorphists argue that we ought to strive for the highest
wisdom and goodness (even if it costs us worldly comforts).  Aquinas
argues that we love according to how we conceive of ourselves: if we
consider ourselves to be our bodies, we primarily on materialistic
values; if we consider ourselves to be our souls, we primarily focus on
spiritual values without neglecting bodily goods. But how does our
culture consider us? What values does it tell us to pursue? What
assumptions does it make about human nature?  </P>

<P>THE PRESENTATION: PLAN FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES</P>

<P>Select a cultural artefact that embodies any theme of this course.
Present it to the class through the medium that expresses that
artefact, i.e. play the song or the clip from a movie. On a handout, type
the words of any lyric or dialogue. Then, on that handout, present a
brief argument that your artefact does indeed reflect a theme from this
course and either a dominant or minority aspect of American culture.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>N.B. Be careful about identifying an artefact as presenting materialism
because since neither hylomorphism nor Cartesian dualism requires
abstention from life's pleasures, it is possible for an artefact to contain
materialistic values without being evidence that materialism
dominates American culture. </P>
