<b><font size=+2>THE HUMAN SOUL AS BOTH FORM AND INTELLECT</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I.76.1: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS UNITED TO THE BODY
AS ITS FORM?</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>N.B. This is an important question because if it is granted that
the intellect can act and exist independently of matter, then it is possible
that individual human beings could lack such an intellect and that as a
result individual human beings would not be immortal. This question was
big during the Middle Ages due to the influence of Arabic philosophers.
It is once again important for three reasons. First, if the intellect or
the intellectual soul is the form of the human body, then it would be impossible
for the human body to be alive apart from the animating presence of one's
personal soul. If this is the case, then it is relevant for various bio-ethical
questions, e.g. whether a person is still alive when his neocortex is destroyed.
Secondly, if it is the intellectual soul that animates matter into the
human body, then Cartesian dualism is mistaken. Thirdly, if Aquinas is
successful in identifying the intellect as being within the soul of each
person and if he is successful in identifying the human soul as the form
activating matter into the human body, then he proves both that human beings
can be personally immortal and that the transmigration of human souls into
different bodies is impossible. This proof begins in this article and is
completed in articles I.76.2-3-4-5-8]</i></b>
<p><b>I answer that, We must assert that the intellect which is the principle
of intellectual operation is the form of the human body. For that whereby
primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the act is to be
attributed: for instance, that whereby a body is primarily healed is health,
and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge; hence health is
a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the soul. The reason is
because nothing acts except so far as it is in act; therefore a thing acts
by that whereby it is in act. Now it is clear that the first thing by which
the body lives is the soul. And as life appears through various operations
in different degrees of living things, that whereby we primarily perform
each of all these vital actions is the soul. For the soul is the primary
principle of our nourishment, sensation, and local movement; and likewise
of our understanding. Therefore this principle by which we primarily understand,
whether it be called the intellect or the intellectual soul, is the form
of the body. This is the demonstration used by <i>Aristotle</i> (De Anima
ii, 2).</b>
<p><b>But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of
the body he must first explain how it is that this action of understanding
is the action of this particular man; for each one is conscious that it
is himself who understands. Now an action may be attributed to anyone in
three ways, as is clear from the Philosopher (Phys. v, 1); for a thing
is said to move or act, either by virtue of its whole self, for instance,
as a physician heals; or by virtue of a part, as a man sees by his eye;
or through an accidental quality, as when we say that something that is
white builds, because it is accidental to the builder to be white. So when
we say that Socrates or <i>Plato</i> understands, it is clear that this
is not attributed to him accidentally; since it is ascribed to him as man,
which is predicated of him essentially. We must therefore say either that
Socrates understands by virtue of his whole self, as <i>Plato</i> maintained,
holding that man is an intellectual soul; or that intelligence is a part
of Socrates. The first cannot stand, as was shown above (Q75, A4), for
this reason, that it is one and the same man who is conscious both that
he understands, and that he senses. But one cannot sense without a body:
therefore the body must be some part of man. It follows therefore that
the intellect by which Socrates understands is a part of Socrates, so that
in some way it is united to the body of Socrates.</b>
<p><b>Some, however, tried to maintain that the intellect is united to
the body as its motor; and hence that the intellect and body form one thing
so that the act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole. This
is, however, absurd for many reasons. . . .Thirdly, because the action
of a motor is never attributed to the thing moved, except as to an instrument;
as the action of a carpenter to a saw. Therefore if [the intellect is the
"motor" of a person's body, then the body is merely the instrument of the
intellect; if so, then personal identity is either the intellect or the
body but not both]. Fourthly, because, although the action of a part be
attributed to the whole, as the action of the eye is attributed to a man;
yet it is never attributed to another part, except perhaps indirectly;
for we do not say that the hand sees because the eye sees. Therefore if
the intellect and Socrates are united [as motor to a boat] . . . , the
action of the intellect cannot be attributed to Socrates. If, however,
Socrates be a whole composed of a union of the intellect with whatever
else belongs to Socrates, and still the intellect be united to those other
things only as a motor, it follows that Socrates is not one absolutely,
and consequently neither a being absolutely, for a thing is a being according
as it is one. There remains, therefore, no other explanation than that
given by Aristotle---namely, that this particular man understands, because
the intellectual principle is his form. Thus from the very operation of
the intellect it is made clear that the intellectual principle is united
to the body as its form.</b>
<p><b>But we must observe that the nobler a form is, the more it rises
above corporeal matter, the less it is merged in matter, and the more it
excels matter by its power and its operation; hence we find that the form
of a mixed body has another operation not caused by its elemental qualities.
And the higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find that
the power of the form excels the elementary matter; as the vegetative soul
excels the form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excels the vegetative
soul. Now the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms. Therefore
it excels corporeal matter in its power by the fact that it has an operation
and a power in which corporeal matter has no share whatever. This power
is called the intellect.</b>
<p><b>It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soul is composed
of matter and form, it would follow that in no way could the soul be the
form of the body. For since the form is an act, and matter is only in potentiality,
that which is composed of matter and form cannot itself be the form of
another by virtue of itself as a whole.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I.76.2: WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HUMAN BEINGS SHARE ONE INTELLECT?</b>
<p><b><i>N.B. If Aquinas were to claim that humans share one intellect,
then his philosophy would be analogous to various pantheistic beliefs,
e.g. the belief that human soul is Brahman.</i></b>
<p><b>I answer that, It is absolutely impossible for one intellect to belong
to all men. This is clear if, as <i>Plato</i> maintained, man is the intellect
itself. For it would follow that Socrates and <i>Plato</i> are one man;
and that they are not distinct from each other, except by something outside
the essence of each. The distinction between <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Plato</i>
would be no other than that of one man with a tunic and another with a
cloak; which is quite absurd.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It is likewise clear that this is impossible
if, according to the opinion of <i>Aristotle</i> (De Anima ii, 2), it is
supposed that the intellect is a part or a power of the soul which is the
form of man. For it is impossible for many distinct individuals to have
one form, as it is impossible for them to have one existence, for the form
is the principle of existence.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Again, this is clearly impossible, whatever one
may hold as to the manner of the union of the intellect to this or that
man. For it is manifest that .... if there is one intellect, no matter
how diverse may be all those things of which the intellect makes use as
instruments, in no way is it possible to say that <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Plato</i>
are otherwise than one understanding man. And if to this we add that to
understand, which is the act of the intellect, is not affected by any organ
other than the intellect itself; it will further follow that there is but
one agent and one action: that is to say that all men are but one . . .
and have but one act of understanding, in regard, that is, of one intelligible
object. .... It follows, therefore, that it is altogether impossible and
unreasonable to maintain that there exists one intellect for all men.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I. 76.3: WHETHER BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN OTHER
SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER?</b>
<p><b><i>ARTICLE COMMENTARY: If Aquinas is correct in arguing that every
human being has only one soul, then it is impossible for "humanoid animals"
to exist (i.e. no human body can live without the animating presence of
the intellectual soul). Death thus occurs when the soul ceases to animate
matter into a living body. This means that when some one suffers "neocortical
death" they are still alive even though the brain's destruction precludes
thought. It thus becomes matter of ethics to decide how to treat such persons
appropriately. See the following article for additional clarification.</i></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b>I answer that . . . . If we suppose, however, that the soul is united
to the body as its form, it is quite impossible for several essentially
different souls to be in one body. This can be made clear by <i>three different
reasons. </i>In the <i>first</i> place, an animal would not be absolutely
one, in which there were several souls. For nothing is absolutely one except
by one form, by which a thing has existence: because a thing has from the
same source both existence and unity; and therefore things which are denominated
by various forms are not absolutely one; as, for instance, "a white man."
If, therefore, man were 'living' by one form, the vegetative soul, and
'animal' by another form, the sensitive soul, and "man" by another form,
the intellectual soul, it would follow that man is not absolutely one.
Thus <i>Aristotle</i> argues, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6), against <i>Plato</i>,
that if the idea of an animal is distinct from the idea of a biped, then
a biped animal is not absolutely one. For this reason, against those who
hold that there are several souls in the body, he asks (De Anima i, 5),
"what contains them?"---that is, what makes them one? It cannot be said
that they are united by the one body; because rather does the soul contain
the body and make it one, than the reverse.</b>
<br><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly</i>, .... <i>Thirdly</i>, this is
shown to be impossible by the fact that when one operation of the soul
is intense it impedes another, which could never be the case unless the
principle of action were essentially one.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive
soul, the intellectual soul, and the nutritive soul are numerically one
soul. This can easily be explained, if we consider the differences of species
and forms. For we observe that the species and forms of things differ from
one another, as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the
animate are more perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect than
plants, and man than brute animals; and in each of these genera there are
various degrees. .... Thus, neither is
<i>Socrates</i> a man by one soul,
and animal by another; but by one and the same soul he is both animal and
man.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I.76.8: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IN EACH PART OF THE BODY?</b>
<p><b>I answer that [the soul is in each part of the body]. . . A proof
of which is, that <i>on the withdrawal of the soul, no part of the body
retains its proper action</i>; although that which retains its species,
retains the action of the species. But act is in that which it actuates:
<i>therefore</i> the soul must be in the whole body, and in each part thereof.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I.76.5: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS PROPERLY UNITED TO SUCH
A BODY?</b>
<p><b>I answer that, ... Now the intellectual soul, as we have seen above
(Q55, A2) in the order of nature, holds the lowest place among intellectual
substances; inasmuch as it is not naturally gifted with the knowledge of
truth, as the angels are; but has to gather knowledge from individual things
by way of the senses, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii). But nature never
fails in necessary things: therefore the intellectual soul had to be endowed
not only with the power of understanding, but also with the power of feeling.
Now the action of the senses is not performed without a corporeal instrument.
Therefore it behooved the intellectual soul to be united to a body fitted
to be a convenient organ of sense.</b>
