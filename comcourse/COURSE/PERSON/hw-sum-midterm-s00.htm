and seeks to instill a sense of the sacred and of mystery antithetical
to the dialectical arguments of Platonism that sought to clearly differentiate
concepts and establish the truthfulness of dualism. Perfection within early
Taoism---unlike Platonism---does not involve clarity and distinct argumentation;
neither is nonbearing to be understood as nonexistence within Taoism (non
being is rather the absence of clear and distinct beings].</font></font></td>

All Seasons" begins 15 minutes before class (if possible, please try to
make it). This movie is about Thomas More who was Chancellor of England
and who refused to surrender his beliefs about the sanctity of marriage.
Reflection questions: (1) Did More's lifestyle reflect dualist, hylomorphic
or materialistic views of the person? (2) Why did More refuse to take the
oath? Was he simply being stubborn? (3) How did Richard Rich's philosophy
of life differ from More's philosophy of life?&nbsp; (4) What did the life
and death of More model?</font></font></td>
