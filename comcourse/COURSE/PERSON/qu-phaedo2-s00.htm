<b><font face="Arial">PHAEDO AND THE ARGUMENTS FOR IMMORTALITY</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">* Read pp. 35-67 (84e-118a); Focus Questions:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">(1) Simmias argues that the body and soul are
like the lyre and harmony. How does this argument by analogy attempt to
show that the soul cannot be immortal?</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">(2) Cebes argues that the soul and the body are
like the weaver and his coat. How does this argument attempt to show that
the soul is not immortal?</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">(3) The effects of Simmias' and Cebes' arguments
against immortality were so strong that Socrates' followers began to despair
of ever proving the soul's immortality. What was Socrates' argument against
such despair?</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">(4) Identify one idea that Socrates uses to refute
Simmias' argument.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">(5) In this autobiographical digression, what
idea does Socrates use to argue against a materialistic view of the person?</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">(6) Identify one key idea that Socrates uses against
the argument of Cebes.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">(7) What surprised you while reading the <i>Phaedo</i>?</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">(8) <i>Reflection question: </i>If it weren't
for Socrates, philosophy may never have recovered from the monism of Parmenides
and the relativism of Protagoras. What was it about Socrates' convictions
that made it possible for philosophy to become <i>the</i> way in which
questions of soul, truth, beauty and goodness are investigated?</font></b>
