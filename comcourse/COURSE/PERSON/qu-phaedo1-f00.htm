<br>&nbsp;

<p><b>(3) Should a philosopher despise the body? Why is the body a prison?&nbsp;

be derived from unequal sensed objects?</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br><b>(6) Does the soul's knowledge of essences or perfections require
that the soul pre-exist the body? Why does the argument that answering

of what was encountered before one was placed in the body?</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>(7) If all knowledge in this life is recollected from one's pre-existing
state, then how come we do not know everything all the time?</b>
