and seeks to instill a sense of the sacred and of mystery antithetical
to the dialectical arguments of Platonism that sought to clearly differentiate
concepts and establish the truthfulness of dualism. Perfection within early
Taoism---unlike Platonism---does not involve clarity and distinct argumentation;
neither is nonbearing to be understood as nonexistence within Taoism (non
being is rather the absence of clear and distinct beings].</font></font></td>

All Seasons" begins 15 minutes before class (if possible, please try to
make it). This movie is about Thomas More who was Chancellor of England
and who refused to surrender his beliefs about the sanctity of marriage.
Reflection questions: (1) Did More's lifestyle reflect dualist, hylomorphic
or materialistic views of the person? (2) Why did More refuse to take the
oath? Was he simply being stubborn? (3) How did Richard Rich's philosophy
of life differ from More's philosophy of life?&nbsp; (4) What did the life
and death of More model?</font></font></td>

handout on "The Drive To Give Oneself Away," by Kavanaugh and "The Metaphysics

life resides in love and in self-giving. (1) What are their arguments?
Outline the key arguments.&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; What evidence can you think
of that would prove or disprove their cases? (3) What philosophies of person
are compatible with their claims? (4) Are their positions new or incompatible
with the philosophers already studied?&nbsp; [After this reading you are
ready to watch "First Knight" at your convenience and consider whether
the arguments of Kavanaugh and Wilhelmsen provide insight into the mindset
of Lancelot and how that mindset changes?&nbsp; Did King Arthur, in "First
Knight"&nbsp; tap into this pyschology of self-giving when he created the
Knights of the Round Table? Does Malagant, the evil knight and warlord,
defy this philosophy of self-giving?&nbsp; Answering these questions should
help prepare you to do the <a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/phil/lemmons/character-anal.htm">character
analysis</a> assignment which focuses upon the character of Lancelot in
