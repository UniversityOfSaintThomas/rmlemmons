<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the same time the Athenians sent thirty
ships to cruise round Locris and also to guard Euboea;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleopompus, son of Clinias, being in command.
Making descents from the fleet he ravaged certain places
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the sea-coast, and captured Thronium and
took hostages from it. He also defeated at Alope the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locrians that had assembled to resist him.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the summer the Athenians also expelled
the Aeginetans with their wives and children from Aegina,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the ground of their having been the chief
agents in bringing the war upon them. Besides, Aegina lies so
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near Peloponnese that it seemed safer to send
colonists of their own to hold it, and shortly afterwards the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; settlers were sent out. The banished Aeginetans
found an asylum in Thyrea, which was given to them by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacedaemon, not only on account of her quarrel
with Athens, but also because the Aeginetans had laid her
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under obligations at the time of the earthquake
and the revolt of the Helots. The territory of Thyrea is on
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the frontier of Argolis and Laconia, reaching
down to the sea. Those of the Aeginetans who did not settle
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here were scattered over the rest of Hellas.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same summer, at the beginning of a new
lunar month, the only time by the way at which it appears
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible, the sun was eclipsed after noon.
After it had assumed the form of a crescent and some of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stars had come out, it returned to its natural
shape.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the same summer Nymphodorus, son of
Pythes, an Abderite, whose sister Sitalces had married,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was made their proxenus by the Athenians and
sent for to Athens. They had hitherto considered him their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enemy; but he had great influence with Sitalces,
and they wished this prince to become their ally. Sitalces
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was the son of Teres and King of the Thracians.
Teres, the father of Sitalces, was the first to establish the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great kingdom of the Odrysians on a scale
quite unknown to the rest of Thrace, a large portion of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thracians being independent. This Teres is
in no way related to Tereus who married Pandion's daughter
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procne from Athens; nor indeed did they belong
to the same part of Thrace. Tereus lived in Daulis, part of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is now called Phocis, but which at that
time was inhabited by Thracians. It was in this land that the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women perpetrated the outrage upon Itys; and
many of the poets when they mention the nightingale call it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Daulian bird. Besides, Pandion in contracting
an alliance for his daughter would consider the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advantages of mutual assistance, and would
naturally prefer a match at the above moderate distance to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journey of many days which separates Athens
from the Odrysians. Again the names are different; and this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teres was king of the Odrysians, the first
by the way who attained to any power. Sitalces, his son, was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now sought as an ally by the Athenians, who
desired his aid in the reduction of the Thracian towns and of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perdiccas. Coming to Athens, Nymphodorus concluded
the alliance with Sitalces and made his son
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadocus an Athenian citizen, and promised
to finish the war in Thrace by persuading Sitalces to send the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athenians a force of Thracian horse and targeteers.
He also reconciled them with Perdiccas, and induced
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them to restore Therme to him; upon which
Perdiccas at once joined the Athenians and Phormio in an
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expedition against the Chalcidians. Thus Sitalces,
son of Teres, King of the Thracians, and Perdiccas, son
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Alexander, King of the Macedonians, became
allies of Athens.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile the Athenians in the hundred vessels
were still cruising round Peloponnese. After taking
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sollium, a town belonging to Corinth, and
presenting the city and territory to the Acarnanians of Palaira,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they stormed Astacus, expelled its tyrant
Evarchus, and gained the place for their confederacy. Next they
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sailed to the island of Cephallenia and brought
it over without using force. Cephallenia lies off Acarnania
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Leucas, and consists of four states, the
Paleans, Cranians, Samaeans, and Pronaeans. Not long
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; afterwards the fleet returned to Athens. Towards
the autumn of this year the Athenians invaded the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megarid with their whole levy, resident aliens
included, under the command of Pericles, son of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xanthippus. The Athenians in the hundred ships
round Peloponnese on their journey home had just
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reached Aegina, and hearing that the citizens
at home were in full force at Megara, now sailed over and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joined them. This was without doubt the largest
army of Athenians ever assembled, the state being still in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the flower of her strength and yet unvisited
by the plague. Full ten thousand heavy infantry were in the field,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all Athenian citizens, besides the three thousand
before Potidaea. Then the resident aliens who joined in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the incursion were at least three thousand
strong; besides which there was a multitude of light troops. They
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ravaged the greater part of the territory,
and then retired. Other incursions into the Megarid were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; afterwards made by the Athenians annually
during the war, sometimes only with cavalry, sometimes with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all their forces. This went on until the capture
of Nisaea. Atalanta also, the desert island off the Opuntian
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coast, was towards the end of this summer
converted into a fortified post by the Athenians, in order to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prevent privateers issuing from Opus and the
rest of Locris and plundering Euboea. Such were the events
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of this summer after the return of the Peloponnesians
from Attica.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ensuing winter the Acarnanian Evarchus,
wishing to return to Astacus, persuaded the Corinthians to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sail over with forty ships and fifteen hundred
heavy infantry and restore him; himself also hiring some
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mercenaries. In command of the force were
Euphamidas, son of Aristonymus, Timoxenus, son of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timocrates, and Eumachus, son of Chrysis,
who sailed over and restored him and, after failing in an
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attempt on some places on the Acarnanian coast
which they were desirous of gaining, began their voyage
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; home. Coasting along shore they touched at
Cephallenia and made a descent on the Cranian territory, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; losing some men by the treachery of the Cranians,
who fell suddenly upon them after having agreed to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; treat, put to sea somewhat hurriedly and returned
home.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same winter the Athenians gave a funeral
at the public cost to those who had first fallen in this war.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a custom of their ancestors, and the
manner of it is as follows. Three days before the ceremony, the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bones of the dead are laid out in a tent which
has been erected; and their friends bring to their relatives
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such offerings as they please. In the funeral
procession cypress coffins are borne in cars, one for each
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tribe; the bones of the deceased being placed
in the coffin of their tribe. Among these is carried one empty
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bier decked for the missing, that is, for
those whose bodies could not be recovered. Any citizen or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stranger who pleases, joins in the procession:
and the female relatives are there to wail at the burial. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead are laid in the public sepulchre in the
Beautiful suburb of the city, in which those who fall in war are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always buried; with the exception of those
slain at Marathon, who for their singular and extraordinary
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; valour were interred on the spot where they
fell. After the bodies have been laid in the earth, a man chosen
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the state, of approved wisdom and eminent
reputation, pronounces over them an appropriate
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; panegyric; after which all retire. Such is
the manner of the burying; and throughout the whole of the war,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whenever the occasion arose, the established
custom was observed. Meanwhile these were the first that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had fallen, and Pericles, son of Xanthippus,
was chosen to pronounce their eulogium. When the proper
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time arrived, he advanced from the sepulchre
to an elevated platform in order to be heard by as many of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the crowd as possible, and spoke as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Most of my predecessors in this place have
commended him who made this speech part of the law, telling
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us that it is well that it should be delivered
at the burial of those who fall in battle. For myself, I should have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thought that the worth which had displayed
itself in deeds would be sufficiently rewarded by honours also
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shown by deeds; such as you now see in this
funeral prepared at the people's cost. And I could have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wished that the reputations of many brave
men were not to be imperilled in the mouth of a single individual,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to stand or fall according as he spoke well
or ill. For it is hard to speak properly upon a subject where it is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even difficult to convince your hearers that
you are speaking the truth. On the one hand, the friend who is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; familiar with every fact of the story may
think that some point has not been set forth with that fullness
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which he wishes and knows it to deserve; on
the other, he who is a stranger to the matter may be led by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; envy to suspect exaggeration if he hears anything
above his own nature. For men can endure to hear
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others praised only so long as they can severally
persuade themselves of their own ability to equal the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actions recounted: when this point is passed,
envy comes in and with it incredulity. However, since our
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ancestors have stamped this custom with their
approval, it becomes my duty to obey the law and to try to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; satisfy your several wishes and opinions as
best I may.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall begin with our ancestors: it is both
just and proper that they should have the honour of the first
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mention on an occasion like the present. They
dwelt in the country without break in the succession from
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generation to generation, and handed it down
free to the present time by their valour. And if our more
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remote ancestors deserve praise, much more
do our own fathers, who added to their inheritance the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; empire which we now possess, and spared no
pains to be able to leave their acquisitions to us of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; present generation. Lastly, there are few
parts of our dominions that have not been augmented by those of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us here, who are still more or less in the
vigour of life; while the mother country has been furnished by us
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with everything that can enable her to depend
on her own resources whether for war or for peace. That
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part of our history which tells of the military
achievements which gave us our several possessions, or of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ready valour with which either we or our fathers
stemmed the tide of Hellenic or foreign aggression, is a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theme too familiar to my hearers for me to
dilate on, and I shall therefore pass it by. But what was the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; road by which we reached our position, what
the form of government under which our greatness grew,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what the national habits out of which it sprang;
these are questions which I may try to solve before I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proceed to my panegyric upon these men; since
I think this to be a subject upon which on the present
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occasion a speaker may properly dwell, and
to which the whole assemblage, whether citizens or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreigners, may listen with advantage.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our constitution does not copy the laws of
neighbouring states; we are rather a pattern to others than
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imitators ourselves. Its administration favours
the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford
equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standing, advancement in public life falls
to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty
bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hindered by the obscurity of his condition.
The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our ordinary life. There, far from exercising
a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon to be angry with our neighbour for doing
what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which cannot fail to be offensive, although
they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relations does not make us lawless as citizens.
Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the magistrates and the laws, particularly
such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually on the statute book, or belong to
that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without acknowledged disgrace.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Further, we provide plenty of means for the
mind to refresh itself from business. We celebrate games and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sacrifices all the year round, and the elegance
of our private establishments forms a daily source of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure and helps to banish the spleen; while
the magnitude of our city draws the produce of the world
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into our harbour, so that to the Athenian
the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as those of his
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we turn to our military policy, there also
we differ from our antagonists. We throw open our city to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world, and never by alien acts exclude foreigners
from any opportunity of learning or observing, although
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit
by our liberality; trusting less in system and policy than to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; native spirit of our citizens; while in education,
where our rivals from their very cradles by a painful
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discipline seek after manliness, at Athens
we live exactly as we please, and yet are just as ready to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encounter every legitimate danger. In proof
of this it may be noticed that the Lacedaemonians do not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invade our country alone, but bring with them
all their confederates; while we Athenians advance
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsupported into the territory of a neighbour,
and fighting upon a foreign soil usually vanquish with ease
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men who are defending their homes. Our united
force was never yet encountered by any enemy, because
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we have at once to attend to our marine and
to dispatch our citizens by land upon a hundred different
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; services; so that, wherever they engage with
some such fraction of our strength, a success against a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detachment is magnified into a victory over
the nation, and a defeat into a reverse suffered at the hands of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our entire people. And yet if with habits
not of labour but of ease, and courage not of art but of nature, we
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are still willing to encounter danger, we
have the double advantage of escaping the experience of hardships
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in anticipation and of facing them in the
hour of need as fearlessly as those who are never free from them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nor are these the only points in which our
city is worthy of admiration. We cultivate refinement without
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extravagance and knowledge without effeminacy;
wealth we employ more for use than for show, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place the real disgrace of poverty not in
owning to the fact but in declining the struggle against it. Our
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public men have, besides politics, their private
affairs to attend to, and our ordinary citizens, though
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occupied with the pursuits of industry, are
still fair judges of public matters; for, unlike any other nation,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regarding him who takes no part in these duties
not as unambitious but as useless, we Athenians are able
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to judge at all events if we cannot originate,
and, instead of looking on discussion as a stumbling-block in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the way of action, we think it an indispensable
preliminary to any wise action at all. Again, in our
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enterprises we present the singular spectacle
of daring and deliberation, each carried to its highest point,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and both united in the same persons; although
usually decision is the fruit of ignorance, hesitation of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reflection. But the palm of courage will surely
be adjudged most justly to those, who best know the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; difference between hardship and pleasure and
yet are never tempted to shrink from danger. In generosity
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we are equally singular, acquiring our friends
by conferring, not by receiving, favours. Yet, of course, the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doer of the favour is the firmer friend of
the two, in order by continued kindness to keep the recipient in his
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debt; while the debtor feels less keenly from
the very consciousness that the return he makes will be a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; payment, not a free gift. And it is only the
Athenians, who, fearless of consequences, confer their benefits
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not from calculations of expediency, but in
the confidence of liberality.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, I say that as a city we are the
school of Hellas, while I doubt if the world can produce a man
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who, where he has only himself to depend upon,
is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy a versatility, as the Athenian. And
that this is no mere boast thrown out for the occasion, but plain
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matter of fact, the power of the state acquired
by these habits proves. For Athens alone of her
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemporaries is found when tested to be
greater than her reputation, and alone gives no occasion to her
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assailants to blush at the antagonist by whom
they have been worsted, or to her subjects to question her
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; title by merit to rule. Rather, the admiration
of the present and succeeding ages will be ours, since we have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not left our power without witness, but have
shown it by mighty proofs; and far from needing a Homer for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our panegyrist, or other of his craft whose
verses might charm for the moment only for the impression
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which they gave to melt at the touch of fact,
we have forced every sea and land to be the highway of our
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daring, and everywhere, whether for evil or
for good, have left imperishable monuments behind us. Such is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Athens for which these men, in the assertion
of their resolve not to lose her, nobly fought and died; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well may every one of their survivors be ready
to suffer in her cause.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed if I have dwelt at some length upon
the character of our country, it has been to show that our
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stake in the struggle is not the same as theirs
who have no such blessings to lose, and also that the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; panegyric of the men over whom I am now speaking
might be by definite proofs established. That
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; panegyric is now in a great measure complete;
for the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heroism of these and their like have made
her, men whose fame, unlike that of most Hellenes, will be found
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be only commensurate with their deserts.
And if a test of worth be wanted, it is to be found in their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; closing scene, and this not only in cases
in which it set the final seal upon their merit, but also in those in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which it gave the first intimation of their
having any. For there is justice in the claim that steadfastness in his
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country's battles should be as a cloak to
cover a man's other imperfections; since the good action has
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blotted out the bad, and his merit as a citizen
more than outweighed his demerits as an individual. But none
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of these allowed either wealth with its prospect
of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hope of a day of freedom and riches to tempt
him to shrink from danger. No, holding that vengeance upon
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their enemies was more to be desired than
any personal blessings, and reckoning this to be the most
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glorious of hazards, they joyfully determined
to accept the risk, to make sure of their vengeance, and to let
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their wishes wait; and while committing to
hope the uncertainty of final success, in the business before them
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they thought fit to act boldly and trust in
themselves. Thus choosing to die resisting, rather than to live
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; submitting, they fled only from dishonour,
but met danger face to face, and after one brief moment, while
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the summit of their fortune, escaped, not
from their fear, but from their glory.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So died these men as became Athenians. You,
their survivors, must determine to have as unfaltering a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolution in the field, though you may pray
that it may have a happier issue. And not contented with ideas
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; derived only from words of the advantages
which are bound up with the defence of your country, though
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these would furnish a valuable text to a speaker
even before an audience so alive to them as the present,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you must yourselves realize the power of Athens,
and feed your eyes upon her from day to day, till love of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her fills your hearts; and then, when all
her greatness shall break upon you, you must reflect that it was by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; courage, sense of duty, and a keen feeling
of honour in action that men were enabled to win all this, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that no personal failure in an enterprise
could make them consent to deprive their country of their valour,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but they laid it at her feet as the most glorious
contribution that they could offer. For this offering of their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lives made in common by them all they each
of them individually received that renown which never grows
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; old, and for a sepulchre, not so much that
in which their bones have been deposited, but that noblest of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shrines wherein their glory is laid up to
be eternally remembered upon every occasion on which deed or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; story shall call for its commemoration. For
heroes have the whole earth for their tomb; and in lands far
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from their own, where the column with its
epitaph declares it, there is enshrined in every breast a record
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unwritten with no tablet to preserve it, except
that of the heart. These take as your model and, judging
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happiness to be the fruit of freedom and freedom
of valour, never decline the dangers of war. For it is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the miserable that would most justly be unsparing
of their lives; these have nothing to hope for: it is rather
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they to whom continued life may bring reverses
as yet unknown, and to whom a fall, if it came, would be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most tremendous in its consequences. And surely,
to a man of spirit, the degradation of cowardice must
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be immeasurably more grievous than the unfelt
death which strikes him in the midst of his strength and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patriotism!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Comfort, therefore, not condolence, is what
I have to offer to the parents of the dead who may be here.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numberless are the chances to which, as they
know, the life of man is subject; but fortunate indeed are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they who draw for their lot a death so glorious
as that which has caused your mourning, and to whom life
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has been so exactly measured as to terminate
in the happiness in which it has been passed. Still I know
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that this is a hard saying, especially when
those are in question of whom you will constantly be reminded
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by seeing in the homes of others blessings
of which once you also boasted: for grief is felt not so much for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the want of what we have never known, as for
the loss of that to which we have been long accustomed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet you who are still of an age to beget children
must bear up in the hope of having others in their stead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not only will they help you to forget those
whom you have lost, but will be to the state at once a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reinforcement and a security; for never can
a fair or just policy be expected of the citizen who does not,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like his fellows, bring to the decision the
interests and apprehensions of a father. While those of you who
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have passed your prime must congratulate yourselves
with the thought that the best part of your life was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fortunate, and that the brief span that remains
will be cheered by the fame of the departed. For it is only
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the love of honour that never grows old; and
honour it is, not gain, as some would have it, that rejoices the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heart of age and helplessness.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Turning to the sons or brothers of the dead,
I see an arduous struggle before you. When a man is gone,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all are wont to praise him, and should your
merit be ever so transcendent, you will still find it difficult not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; merely to overtake, but even to approach their
renown. The living have envy to contend with, while those
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who are no longer in our path are honoured
with a goodwill into which rivalry does not enter. On the other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand, if I must say anything on the subject
of female excellence to those of you who will now be in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; widowhood, it will be all comprised in this
brief exhortation. Great will be your glory in not falling short of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your natural character; and greatest will
be hers who is least talked of among the men, whether for good
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or for bad.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My task is now finished. I have performed
it to the best of my ability, and in word, at least, the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requirements of the law are now satisfied.
If deeds be in question, those who are here interred have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received part of their honours already, and
for the rest, their children will be brought up till manhood at the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public expense: the state thus offers a valuable
prize, as the garland of victory in this race of valour, for the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reward both of those who have fallen and their
survivors. And where the rewards for merit are greatest,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there are found the best citizens.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And now that you have brought to a close your
lamentations for your relatives, you may depart."
