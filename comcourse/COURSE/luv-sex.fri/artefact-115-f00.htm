understanding of the American cultural view of the philosophy of person. </strong></p>

<p><strong>For your first cultural artifact present to the class some manmade object that
represents either a dominant or a minority aspect of how American culture views the
meaning of life and the identity of one's destiny as a human being. Your presentation
should include a handout containing two arguments: (1) an argument that your artifact
reflects an American cultural perspective; and (2) an argument that that your cultural
artifact either promotes or hinders the truth about what it means to be a human being.
&nbsp; Your presentation should be insightful, reflective and well-argued. It should not
last for more than five minutes.</strong></p>
