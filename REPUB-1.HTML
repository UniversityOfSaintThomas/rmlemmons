<p><a NAME="start"></a><a NAME="10"></a>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<a NAME="11"></a>

<p>I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston,&nbsp;<a NAME="12"></a>that
I might offer up my prayers to the goddess; and also because I wanted&nbsp;<a NAME="13"></a>to
see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new&nbsp;<a NAME="14"></a>thing.
I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that&nbsp;<a NAME="15"></a>of
the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we ha
d finished&nbsp;<a NAME="16"></a>our
prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the&nbsp;<a NAME="17"></a>city;
and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch&nbsp;<a NAME="18"></a>sight
of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told&nbsp;<a NAME="19"></a>his
servant to run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me&nbsp;<a NAME="20"></a>by
the cloak behind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to&nbsp;<a NAME="21"></a>wait.&nbsp;<a NAME="22"></a>

<p>I turned round, and asked him where his master&nbsp;<a NAME="23"></a>was.&nbsp;<a NAME="24"></a>
<br>There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only&nbsp;<a NAME="25"></a>wait.&nbsp;<a NAME="26"></a>

<p>Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus&nbsp;<a NAME="27"></a>appeared,
and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus the son&nbsp;<a NAME="28"></a>of
Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.&nbsp;<a NAME="29"></a>

<p>Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS&nbsp;<a NAME="30"></a>

<p>Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and our&nbsp;<a NAME="31"></a>companion
are already on your way to the city.&nbsp;<a NAME="32"></a>

<p>You are not far wrong, I said.&nbsp;<a NAME="33"></a>
<br>But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?&nbsp;<a NAME="34"></a>
<br>Of course.&nbsp;<a NAME="35"></a>
<br>And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain&nbsp;<a NAME="36"></a>
where
you are.&nbsp;<a NAME="37"></a>

<p>May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade&nbsp;<a NAME="38"></a>you
to let us go?&nbsp;<a NAME="39"></a>

<p>But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he&nbsp;<a NAME="40"></a>said.&nbsp;<a NAME="41"></a>
<br>Certainly not, replied Glaucon.&nbsp;<a NAME="42"></a>
<br>Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be&nbsp;<a NAME="43"></a>assured.&nbsp;<a NAME="44"></a>
<br>Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the tor
ch-race on horseback&nbsp;<a NAME="45"></a>in
honour of the goddess which will take place in the&nbsp;<a NAME="46"></a>evening?&nbsp;<a NAME="47"></a>

<p>With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry&nbsp;<a NAME="48"></a>torches
and pass them one to another during the race?&nbsp;<a NAME="49"></a>

<p>Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will he&nbsp;<a NAME="50"></a>celebrated
at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon&nbsp;<a NAME="51"></a>after

supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young&nbsp;<a NAME="52"></a>men,
and we will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be&nbsp;<a NAME="53"></a>perverse.&nbsp;<a NAME="54"></a>

<p>Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we&nbsp;<a NAME="55"></a>must.&nbsp;<a NAME="56"></a>
<br>Very good, I replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="57"></a>

<p>Glaucon - CEPHALUS - SOCRATES&nbsp;<a NAME="58"></a>

<p>Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we&nbsp;<a NAME="59"></ A>found
his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the&nbsp;<a NAME="60"></a>Chalcedonian,
Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of Aristonymus.&nbsp;<a NAME="61"></a>There
too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I had not seen for&nbsp;<a NAME="62"></a>a
long time, and I thought him very much aged. He was seated on a cushioned&nbsp;<a NAME="63"></a>chair,
and had a garland on his head, for he had been sacrificing in the&nbsp;<a NAME="64"></a>court;
and there w
ere some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle,&nbsp;<a NAME="65"></a>upon
which we sat down by him. He saluted me eagerly, and then he said:&nbsp;<a NAME="66"></a>--&nbsp;<a NAME="67"></a>

<p>You don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I&nbsp;<a NAME="68"></a>were
still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But&nbsp;<a NAME="69"></a>at
my age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come oftener&nbsp;<a NAME="70"></a>to
the Piraeus. For
 let me tell you, that the more the pleasures of the&nbsp;<a NAME="71"></a>body
fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation.&nbsp;<a NAME="72"></a>Do
not then deny my request, but make our house your resort and keep company&nbsp;<a NAME="73"></a>with
these young men; we are old friends, and you will be quite at home&nbsp;<a NAME="74"></a>with
us.&nbsp;<a NAME="75"></a>

<p>I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus,&nbsp;<a NAME="76"></a>than
conv
ersing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who have&nbsp;<a NAME="77"></a>gone
a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to enquire,&nbsp;<a NAME="78"></a>whether
the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And this is&nbsp;<a NAME="79"></a>a
question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time&nbsp;<a NAME="80"></a>which
the poets call the 'threshold of old age' --Is life harder towards&nbsp;<a NAME="81"></a>the
end, or what report do you give of
 it?&nbsp;<a NAME="82"></a>

<p>I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men&nbsp;<a NAME="83"></a>of
my age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb&nbsp;<a NAME="84"></a>says;
and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is --I cannot&nbsp;<a NAME="85"></a>eat,
I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away: there&nbsp;<a NAME="86"></a>was
a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer life.&nbsp;<a NAME="87"></a>Some


complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations, and&nbsp;<a NAME="88"></a>they
will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause.&nbsp;<a NAME="89"></a>But
to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which is not&nbsp;<a NAME="90"></a>really
in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old, and every&nbsp;<a NAME="91"></a>other
old man, would have felt as they do. But this is not my own experience,&nbsp;<a NAME="92"></a>nor
that of others whom I have know
n. How well I remember the aged poet&nbsp;<a NAME="93"></a>Sophocles,
when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age,&nbsp;<a NAME="94"></a>Sophocles,
--are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most gladly&nbsp;<a NAME="95"></a>have
I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped&nbsp;<a NAME="96"></a>from
a mad and furious master. His words have often occurred to my mind&nbsp;<a NAME="97"></a>since,
and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttere
d them.&nbsp;<a NAME="98"></a>For
certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions&nbsp;<a NAME="99"></a>relax
their hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp&nbsp;<a NAME="100"></a>not
of one mad master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these&nbsp;<a NAME="101"></a>regrets,
and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed&nbsp;<a NAME="102"></a>to
the same cause, which is not old age, but men's characters and tempers;&nbsp;<a NAME="
103"></a>for
he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure&nbsp;<a NAME="104"></a>of
age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are&nbsp;<a NAME="105"></a>equally
a burden.&nbsp;<a NAME="106"></a>

<p>I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he&nbsp;<a NAME="107"></a>might
go on --Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in&nbsp;<a NAME="108"></a>general
are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old&nbsp;<a NAME="109"></a>age
sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but because&nbsp;<a NAME="110"></a>you
are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great&nbsp;<a NAME="111"></a>comforter.&nbsp;<a NAME="112"></a>

<p>You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is&nbsp;<a NAME="113"></a>something
in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I might&nbsp;<a NAME="114"></a>answer
them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him&nbsp;<a NAME="115
"></a>and
saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but because he was&nbsp;<a NAME="116"></a>an
Athenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours, neither&nbsp;<a NAME="117"></a>of
us would have been famous.' And to those who are not rich and are impatient&nbsp;<a NAME="118"></a>of
old age, the same reply may be made; for to the good poor man old age&nbsp;<a NAME="119"></a>cannot
be a light burden, nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with&nbsp;<a NAME="120"></a>himself.&nbsp;<a NAME="121"></a>

<p>May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part&nbsp;<a NAME="122"></a>inherited
or acquired by you?&nbsp;<a NAME="123"></a>

<p>Acquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In&nbsp;<a NAME="124"></a>the
art of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather:&nbsp;<a NAME="125"></a>for
my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of&nbsp;<a NAME="126"></a>his
patrimony, that which he inherited being much what
 I possess now; but&nbsp;<a NAME="127"></a>my
father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present: and&nbsp;<a NAME="128"></a>I
shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little&nbsp;<a NAME="129"></a>more
than I received.&nbsp;<a NAME="130"></a>

<p>That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see&nbsp;<a NAME="131"></a>that
you are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather&nbsp;<a NAME="132"></a>of
those who have inherited their fortune
s than of those who have acquired&nbsp;<a NAME="133"></a>them;
the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation&nbsp;<a NAME="134"></a>of
their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems,&nbsp;<a NAME="135"></a>or
of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for the&nbsp;<a NAME="136"></a>sake
of use and profit which is common to them and all men. And hence they&nbsp;<a NAME="137"></a>are
very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but the prais
es of&nbsp;<a NAME="138"></a>wealth.
That is true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="139"></a>

<p>Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question? What do&nbsp;<a NAME="140"></a>you
consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your&nbsp;<a NAME="141"></a>wealth?&nbsp;<a NAME="142"></a>

<p>One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others.&nbsp;<a NAME="143"></a>For
let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near&nbsp;<a NAME="144"></a>death,
fe
ars and cares enter into his mind which he never had before; the&nbsp;<a NAME="145"></a>tales
of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds&nbsp;<a NAME="146"></a>done
here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he is tormented with&nbsp;<a NAME="147"></a>the
thought that they may be true: either from the weakness of age, or&nbsp;<a NAME="148"></a>because
he is now drawing nearer to that other place, he has a clearer&nbsp;<a NAME="149"></a>view
of these things; suspicions and
 alarms crowd thickly upon him, and&nbsp;<a NAME="150"></a>he
begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others. And&nbsp;<a NAME="151"></a>when
he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many&nbsp;<a NAME="152"></a>a
time like a child start up in his sleep for fear, and he is filled with&nbsp;<a NAME="153"></a>dark
forebodings. But to him who is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as&nbsp;<a NAME="154"></a>Pindar
charmingly says, is the kind nurse of his age:&nbsp;<a NAME="155"></a>

<p>Hope, he says, cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and&nbsp;<a NAME="156"></a>holiness
and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey;&nbsp;<a NAME="157"></a>--hope
which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of&nbsp;<a NAME="158"></a>man.&nbsp;<a NAME="159"></a>

<p>How admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches,&nbsp;<a NAME="160"></a>I
do not say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion&nbsp;<a NAME="161"></a>to
dece
ive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;&nbsp;<a NAME="162"></a>and
when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about&nbsp;<a NAME="163"></a>offerings
due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to this peace&nbsp;<a NAME="164"></a>of
mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and therefore I say,&nbsp;<a NAME="165"></a>that,
setting one thing against another, of the many advantages which wealth&nbsp;<a NAME="166"></a>has
to give, to a man o
f sense this is in my opinion the&nbsp;<a NAME="167"></a>greatest.&nbsp;<a NAME="168"></a>

<p>Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what&nbsp;<a NAME="169"></a>is
it? --to speak the truth and to pay your debts --no more than this?&nbsp;<a NAME="170"></a>And
even to this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in&nbsp;<a NAME="171"></a>his
right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he&nbsp;<a NAME="172"></a>is
not in his right mind, ought I to giv
e them back to him? No one would&nbsp;<a NAME="173"></a>say
that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than they&nbsp;<a NAME="174"></a>would
say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his&nbsp;<a NAME="175"></a>condition.&nbsp;<a NAME="176"></a>

<p>You are quite right, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="177"></a>
<br>But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a&nbsp;<a NAME="178"></a>correct
definition of justice.&nbsp;<a NAME="179"></a>

<p>Cephalu
s - SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS&nbsp;<a NAME="180"></a>

<p>Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said Polemarchus&nbsp;<a NAME="181"></a>interposing.&nbsp;<a NAME="182"></a>

<p>I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after&nbsp;<a NAME="183"></a>the
sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the&nbsp;<a NAME="184"></a>company.&nbsp;<a NAME="185"></a>

<p>Is not Polemarchus your heir? I said.&nbsp;<a NAME="186"></a>
<br>To be sure, he answered, a
nd went away laughing to the&nbsp;<a NAME="187"></a>sacrifices.&nbsp;<a NAME="188"></a>

<p>Socrates - POLEMARCHUS&nbsp;<a NAME="189"></a>

<p>Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say,&nbsp;<a NAME="190"></a>and
according to you truly say, about justice?&nbsp;<a NAME="191"></a>

<p>He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so&nbsp;<a NAME="192"></a>he
appears to me to be right.&nbsp;<a NAME="193"></a>

<p>I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise
 and inspired&nbsp;<a NAME="194"></a>man,
but his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear&nbsp;<a NAME="195"></a>to
me. For he certainly does not mean, as we were now saying that I ought&nbsp;<a NAME="196"></a>to
return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks&nbsp;<a NAME="197"></a>for
it when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be&nbsp;<a NAME="198"></a>denied
to be a debt.&nbsp;<a NAME="199"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="200"></a>
<b R>Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no&nbsp;<a NAME="201"></a>means
to make the return?&nbsp;<a NAME="202"></a>

<p>Certainly not.&nbsp;<a NAME="203"></a>
<br>When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did&nbsp;<a NAME="204"></a>not
mean to include that case?&nbsp;<a NAME="205"></a>

<p>Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good&nbsp;<a NAME="206"></a>to
a friend and never evil.&nbsp;<a NAME="207"></a>

<p>You mean that 
the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury&nbsp;<a NAME="208"></a>of
the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of&nbsp;<a NAME="209"></a>a
debt, --that is what you would imagine him to say?&nbsp;<a NAME="210"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="211"></a>
<br>And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?&nbsp;<a NAME="212"></a>
<br>To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an enemy,&nbsp;<a NAME="213"></a>as
I take it, owes to an enemy that whic
h is due or proper to him --that&nbsp;<a NAME="214"></a>is
to say, evil.&nbsp;<a NAME="215"></a>

<p>Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have&nbsp;<a NAME="216"></a>spoken
darkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that&nbsp;<a NAME="217"></a>justice
is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he termed&nbsp;<a NAME="218"></a>a
debt.&nbsp;<a NAME="219"></a>

<p>That must have been his meaning, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="220"></a>
<br>By heaven! I rep
lied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing&nbsp;<a NAME="221"></a>is
given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would&nbsp;<a NAME="222"></a>make
to us?&nbsp;<a NAME="223"></a>

<p>He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink&nbsp;<a NAME="224"></a>to
human bodies.&nbsp;<a NAME="225"></a>

<p>And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to&nbsp;<a NAME="226"></a>what?&nbsp;<a NAME="227"></a>
<br>Seasoning to food.&nbsp;<a NAME="228"></a>

<br>And what is that which justice gives, and to whom?&nbsp;<a NAME="229"></a>
<br>If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding&nbsp;<a NAME="230"></a>instances,
then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil&nbsp;<a NAME="231"></a>to
enemies.&nbsp;<a NAME="232"></a>

<p>That is his meaning then?&nbsp;<a NAME="233"></a>
<br>I think so.&nbsp;<a NAME="234"></a>
<br>And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies&nbsp;<a NAME="235"></a>in


time of sickness?&nbsp;<a NAME="236"></a>

<p>The physician.&nbsp;<a NAME="237"></a>
<br>Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the&nbsp;<a NAME="238"></a>sea?&nbsp;<a NAME="239"></a>
<br>The pilot.&nbsp;<a NAME="240"></a>
<br>And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just&nbsp;<a NAME="241"></a>man
most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his&nbsp;<a NAME="242"></a>friends?&nbsp;<a NAME="243"></a>

<p>In going to war against the one and in making alliances wit
h the&nbsp;<a NAME="244"></a>other.&nbsp;<a NAME="245"></a>

<p>But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of&nbsp;<a NAME="246"></a>a
physician?&nbsp;<a NAME="247"></a>

<p>No.&nbsp;<a NAME="248"></a>
<br>And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?&nbsp;<a NAME="249"></a>
<br>No.&nbsp;<a NAME="250"></a>
<br>Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?&nbsp;<a NAME="251"></a>
<br>I am very far from thinking so.&nbsp;<a NAME="252"></a>
<br>You think that justice may
 be of use in peace as well as in&nbsp;<a NAME="253"></a>war?&nbsp;<a NAME="254"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="255"></a>
<br>Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?&nbsp;<a NAME="256"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="257"></a>
<br>Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes, --that is what you&nbsp;<a NAME="258"></a>mean?&nbsp;<a NAME="259"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="260"></a>
<br>And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of&nbsp;<a NAME="261"></a>peace?&nbsp;<a NAME="262"></ A>

<p>In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.&nbsp;<a NAME="263"></a>
<br>And by contracts you mean partnerships?&nbsp;<a NAME="264"></a>
<br>Exactly.&nbsp;<a NAME="265"></a>
<br>But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better&nbsp;<a NAME="266"></a>partner
at a game of draughts?&nbsp;<a NAME="267"></a>

<p>The skilful player.&nbsp;<a NAME="268"></a>
<br>And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful&nbsp;<a NAME="269"></a>or
better partner than the bui
lder?&nbsp;<a NAME="270"></a>

<p>Quite the reverse.&nbsp;<a NAME="271"></a>
<br>Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than&nbsp;<a NAME="272"></a>the
harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a&nbsp;<a NAME="273"></a>better
partner than the just man?&nbsp;<a NAME="274"></a>

<p>In a money partnership.&nbsp;<a NAME="275"></a>
<br>Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not&nbsp;<a NAME="276"></a>want
a just man to be your c
ounsellor the purchase or sale of a horse;&nbsp;<a NAME="277"></a>a
man who is knowing about horses would be better for that, would he&nbsp;<a NAME="278"></a>not?&nbsp;<a NAME="279"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="280"></a>
<br>And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would&nbsp;<a NAME="281"></a>be
better?&nbsp;<a NAME="282"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="283"></a>
<br>Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man&nbsp;<a NAME="284"></a>is
to be preferred?
&nbsp;<a NAME="285"></a>

<p>When you want a deposit to be kept safely.&nbsp;<a NAME="286"></a>
<br>You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to&nbsp;<a NAME="287"></a>lie?&nbsp;<a NAME="288"></a>
<br>Precisely.&nbsp;<a NAME="289"></a>
<br>That is to say, justice is useful when money is&nbsp;<a NAME="290"></a>useless?&nbsp;<a NAME="291"></a>
<br>That is the inference.&nbsp;<a NAME="292"></a>
<br>And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful&nbsp;<a NAME="293"></a>to
the 
individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then the&nbsp;<a NAME="294"></a>art
of the vine-dresser?&nbsp;<a NAME="295"></a>

<p>Clearly.&nbsp;<a NAME="296"></a>
<br>And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them,&nbsp;<a NAME="297"></a>you
would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then&nbsp;<a NAME="298"></a>the
art of the soldier or of the musician?&nbsp;<a NAME="299"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="300"></a>
<br>And so of all the other th
ings; --justice is useful when they are useless,&nbsp;<a NAME="301"></a>and
useless when they are useful?&nbsp;<a NAME="302"></a>

<p>That is the inference.&nbsp;<a NAME="303"></a>
<br>Then justice is not good for much. But let us consider this further&nbsp;<a NAME="304"></a>point:
Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any&nbsp;<a NAME="305"></a>kind
of fighting best able to ward off a blow?&nbsp;<a NAME="306"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="307"></a>
<br>And he who is most
 skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease&nbsp;<a NAME="308"></a>is
best able to create one?&nbsp;<a NAME="309"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="310"></a>
<br>And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march&nbsp;<a NAME="311"></a>upon
the enemy?&nbsp;<a NAME="312"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="313"></a>
<br>Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good&nbsp;<a NAME="314"></a>thief?&nbsp;<a NAME="315"></a>
<br>That, I suppose, is to be inferred.&nbsp;<a NAME="3
16"></a>
<br>Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing&nbsp;<a NAME="317"></a>it.&nbsp;<a NAME="318"></a>

<p>That is implied in the argument.&nbsp;<a NAME="319"></a>
<br>Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this&nbsp;<a NAME="320"></a>is
a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; for he,&nbsp;<a NAME="321"></a>speaking
of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a favourite&nbsp;<a NAME="322"></a>of
his, affirms tha
t&nbsp;<a NAME="323"></a>

<p>He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury. And so, you&nbsp;<a NAME="324"></a>and
Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft; to&nbsp;<a NAME="325"></a>be
practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies,'&nbsp;<a NAME="326"></a>--that
was what you were saying?&nbsp;<a NAME="327"></a>

<p>No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say;&nbsp;<a NAME="328"></a>but
I still stand by the latter words.&nbsp;
<a NAME="329"></a>

<p>Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean&nbsp;<a NAME="330"></a>those
who are so really, or only in seeming?&nbsp;<a NAME="331"></a>

<p>Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks&nbsp;<a NAME="332"></a>good,
and to hate those whom he thinks evil.&nbsp;<a NAME="333"></a>

<p>Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who&nbsp;<a NAME="334"></a>are
not good seem to be so, and conversely?&nbsp;<a NAME="335"></a>

<p>That is true.&nbsp;<a NAME="336"></a>
<br>Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends?&nbsp;<a NAME="337"></a>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="338"></a>

<p>And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and&nbsp;<a NAME="339"></a>evil
to the good?&nbsp;<a NAME="340"></a>

<p>Clearly.&nbsp;<a NAME="341"></a>
<br>But the good are just and would not do an injustice?&nbsp;<a NAME="342"></a>
<br>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="343"></a>
<br>Then according to your argument it 
is just to injure those who do no&nbsp;<a NAME="344"></a>wrong?&nbsp;<a NAME="345"></a>

<p>Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.&nbsp;<a NAME="346"></a>
<br>Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the&nbsp;<a NAME="347"></a>unjust?&nbsp;<a NAME="348"></a>

<p>I like that better.&nbsp;<a NAME="349"></a>
<br>But see the consequence: --Many a man who is ignorant of human nature&nbsp;<a NAME="350"></a>has
friends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm to&nbsp;;<a NAME="351"></a>them;
and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we&nbsp;<a NAME="352"></a>shall
be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the meaning&nbsp;<a NAME="353"></a>of
Simonides.&nbsp;<a NAME="354"></a>

<p>Very true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an error&nbsp;<a NAME="355"></a>into
which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and&nbsp;<a NAME="356"></a>'enemy.'&nbsp;<a NAME="357"></a>

<p>What was the error, Polema
rchus? I asked.&nbsp;<a NAME="358"></a>
<br>We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought&nbsp;<a NAME="359"></a>good.&nbsp;<a NAME="360"></a>

<p>And how is the error to be corrected?&nbsp;<a NAME="361"></a>
<br>We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems,&nbsp;<a NAME="362"></a>good;
and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and&nbsp;<a NAME="363"></a>is
not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.&nbsp;<a NAME="364"></a>

<p>You 
would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our&nbsp;<a NAME="365"></a>enemies?&nbsp;<a NAME="366"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="367"></a>
<br>And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to&nbsp;<a NAME="368"></a>do
good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say:&nbsp;<a NAME="369"></a>It
is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our&nbsp;<a NAME="370"></a>enemies
when they are evil?&nbsp;<a NAME="371"></a>

<p>Yes, that appears
 to me to be the truth.&nbsp;<a NAME="372"></a>
<br>But ought the just to injure any one at all?&nbsp;<a NAME="373"></a>
<br>Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his&nbsp;<a NAME="374"></a>enemies.&nbsp;<a NAME="375"></a>

<p>When horses are injured, are they improved or&nbsp;<a NAME="376"></a>deteriorated?&nbsp;<a NAME="377"></a>
<br>The latter.&nbsp;<a NAME="378"></a>
<br>Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not&nbsp;<a NAME="379"></a>of
dogs?&nbsp;
<a NAME="380"></a>

<p>Yes, of horses.&nbsp;<a NAME="381"></a>
<br>And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of&nbsp;<a NAME="382"></a>horses?&nbsp;<a NAME="383"></a>

<p>Of course.&nbsp;<a NAME="384"></a>
<br>And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the&nbsp;<a NAME="385"></a>proper
virtue of man?&nbsp;<a NAME="386"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="387"></a>
<br>And that human virtue is justice?&nbsp;<a NAME="388"></a>
<br>To be sure.&nbsp;<a NAME="389"></a>
<br>Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?&nbsp;<a NAME="390"></a>
<br>That is the result.&nbsp;<a NAME="391"></a>
<br>But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?&nbsp;<a NAME="392"></a>
<br>Certainly not.&nbsp;<a NAME="393"></a>
<br>Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?&nbsp;<a NAME="394"></a>
<br>Impossible.&nbsp;<a NAME="395"></a>
<br>And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can&nbsp;<a NAME="396"></a>the
good by virtue make
 them bad?&nbsp;<a NAME="397"></a>

<p>Assuredly not.&nbsp;<a NAME="398"></a>
<br>Any more than heat can produce cold?&nbsp;<a NAME="399"></a>
<br>It cannot.&nbsp;<a NAME="400"></a>
<br>Or drought moisture?&nbsp;<a NAME="401"></a>
<br>Clearly not.&nbsp;<a NAME="402"></a>
<br>Nor can the good harm any one?&nbsp;<a NAME="403"></a>
<br>Impossible.&nbsp;<a NAME="404"></a>
<br>And the just is the good?&nbsp;<a NAME="405"></a>
<br>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="406"></a>
<br>Then to injure a friend or any on
e else is not the act of a just man,&nbsp;<a NAME="407"></a>but
of the opposite, who is the unjust?&nbsp;<a NAME="408"></a>

<p>I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.&nbsp;<a NAME="409"></a>
<br>Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts,&nbsp;<a NAME="410"></a>and
that good is the debt which a man owes to his friends, and evil the&nbsp;<a NAME="411"></a>debt
which he owes to his enemies, --to say this is not wise; for it is&nbsp;<a NAME="412"></a>not
true, if, as 
has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be&nbsp;<a NAME="413"></a>in
no case just.&nbsp;<a NAME="414"></a>

<p>I agree with you, said Polemarchus.&nbsp;<a NAME="415"></a>
<br>Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes&nbsp;<a NAME="416"></a>such
a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other wise man or&nbsp;<a NAME="417"></a>seer?&nbsp;<a NAME="418"></a>

<p>I am quite ready to do battle at your side, he&nbsp;<a NAME="419"></a>said.&nbsp;<a NAME="
420"></a>
<br>Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?&nbsp;<a NAME="421"></a>
<br>Whose?&nbsp;<a NAME="422"></a>
<br>I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban,&nbsp;<a NAME="423"></a>or
some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own power,&nbsp;<a NAME="424"></a>was
the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends and harm&nbsp;<a NAME="425"></a>to
your enemies.'&nbsp;<a NAME="426"></a>

<p>Most true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="427"></a>
<br>Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what&nbsp;<a NAME="428"></a>other
can be offered?&nbsp;<a NAME="429"></a>

<p>Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had&nbsp;<a NAME="430"></a>made
an attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put&nbsp;<a NAME="431"></a>down
by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. But when Polemarchus&nbsp;<a NAME="432"></a>and
I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no longer
 hold&nbsp;<a NAME="433"></a>his
peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a wild beast,&nbsp;<a NAME="434"></a>seeking
to devour us. We were quite panic-stricken at the sight of&nbsp;<a NAME="435"></a>him.&nbsp;<a NAME="436"></a>

<p>Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS&nbsp;<a NAME="437"></a>

<p>He roared out to the whole company: What folly. Socrates, has taken&nbsp;<a NAME="438"></a>possession
of you all? And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one&nbsp;<a NAME="439"></a>another
?
I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you should&nbsp;<a NAME="440"></a>not
only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to yourself from&nbsp;<a NAME="441"></a>the
refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many&nbsp;<a NAME="442"></a>a
one who can ask and cannot answer. And now I will not have you say that&nbsp;<a NAME="443"></a>justice
is duty or advantage or profit or gain or interest, for this sort&nbsp;<a NAME="444"></a>of
nonsense will not do for
 me; I must have clearness and&nbsp;<a NAME="445"></a>accuracy.&nbsp;<a NAME="446"></a>

<p>I was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without&nbsp;<a NAME="447"></a>trembling.
Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him, I&nbsp;<a NAME="448"></a>should
have been struck dumb: but when I saw his fury rising, I looked&nbsp;<a NAME="449"></a>at
him first, and was therefore able to reply to him.&nbsp;<a NAME="450"></a>

<p>Thrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don't be hard 
upon us. Polemarchus&nbsp;<a NAME="451"></a>and
I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but I can&nbsp;<a NAME="452"></a>assure
you that the error was not intentional. If we were seeking for a&nbsp;<a NAME="453"></a>piece
of gold, you would not imagine that we were 'knocking under to one&nbsp;<a NAME="454"></a>another,'
and so losing our chance of finding it. And why, when we are&nbsp;<a NAME="455"></a>seeking
for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of gold, do&nbsp;<a N AME="456"></a>you
say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our utmost&nbsp;<a NAME="457"></a>to
get at the truth? Nay, my good friend, we are most willing and anxious&nbsp;<a NAME="458"></a>to
do so, but the fact is that we cannot. And if so, you people who know&nbsp;<a NAME="459"></a>all
things should pity us and not be angry with us.&nbsp;<a NAME="460"></a>

<p>How characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh;&nbsp;<a NAME="461"></a>--that's
your ironical style! D
id I not foresee --have I not already told&nbsp;<a NAME="462"></a>you,
that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony&nbsp;<a NAME="463"></a>or
any other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?&nbsp;<a NAME="464"></a>

<p>You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that&nbsp;<a NAME="465"></a>if
you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit&nbsp;<a NAME="466"></a>him
whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or s
ix&nbsp;<a NAME="467"></a>times
two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do&nbsp;<a NAME="468"></a>for
me,' --then obviously, that is your way of putting the question, no&nbsp;<a NAME="469"></a>one
can answer you. But suppose that he were to retort, 'Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<a NAME="470"></a>what
do you mean? If one of these numbers which you interdict be the true&nbsp;<a NAME="471"></a>answer
to the question, am I falsely to say some other number which is&nbsp;<a NAME="472"></a>not
th
e right one? --is that your meaning?' -How would you answer&nbsp;<a NAME="473"></a>him?&nbsp;<a NAME="474"></a>

<p>Just as if the two cases were at all alike! he&nbsp;<a NAME="475"></a>said.&nbsp;<a NAME="476"></a>
<br>Why should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, but only&nbsp;<a NAME="477"></a>appear
to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he&nbsp;<a NAME="478"></a>thinks,
whether you and I forbid him or not?&nbsp;<a NAME="479"></a>

<p>I presume then that you 
are going to make one of the interdicted&nbsp;<a NAME="480"></a>answers?&nbsp;<a NAME="481"></a>

<p>I dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection&nbsp;<a NAME="482"></a>I
approve of any of them.&nbsp;<a NAME="483"></a>

<p>But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better,&nbsp;<a NAME="484"></a>he
said, than any of these? What do you deserve to have done to&nbsp;<a NAME="485"></a>you?&nbsp;<a NAME="486"></a>

<p>Done to me! --as becomes the ignorant, I must le
arn from the wise&nbsp;<a NAME="487"></a>--that
is what I deserve to have done to me.&nbsp;<a NAME="488"></a>

<p>What, and no payment! a pleasant notion!&nbsp;<a NAME="489"></a>
<br>I will pay when I have the money, I replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="490"></a>

<p>Socrates - THRASYMACHUS - GLAUCON&nbsp;<a NAME="491"></a>

<p>But you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, need&nbsp;<a NAME="492"></a>be
under no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for&nbsp;<a NAME="493"></a>
Socrates.&nbsp;<a NAME="494"></a>

<p>Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does --refuse&nbsp;<a NAME="495"></a>to
answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one&nbsp;<a NAME="496"></a>else.&nbsp;<a NAME="497"></a>

<p>Why, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows,&nbsp;<a NAME="498"></a>and
says that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint&nbsp;<a NAME="499"></a>notions
of his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter th
em? The&nbsp;<a NAME="500"></a>natural
thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself who&nbsp;<a NAME="501"></a>professes
to know and can tell what he knows. Will you then kindly answer,&nbsp;<a NAME="502"></a>for
the edification of the company and of myself ?&nbsp;<a NAME="503"></a>

<p>Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<a NAME="504"></a>as
any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he thought that&nbsp;<a NAME="505"></a>he
had a
n excellent answer, and would distinguish himself. But at first&nbsp;<a NAME="506"></a>he
to insist on my answering; at length he consented to begin. Behold,&nbsp;<a NAME="507"></a>he
said, the wisdom of Socrates; he refuses to teach himself, and goes&nbsp;<a NAME="508"></a>about
learning of others, to whom he never even says thank&nbsp;<a NAME="509"></a>you.&nbsp;<a NAME="510"></a>

<p>That I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am&nbsp;<a NAME="511"></a>ungrateful
I wholly deny. Mon
ey I have none, and therefore I pay in praise,&nbsp;<a NAME="512"></a>which
is all I have: and how ready I am to praise any one who appears to&nbsp;<a NAME="513"></a>me
to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer; for I expect&nbsp;<a NAME="514"></a>that
you will answer well.&nbsp;<a NAME="515"></a>

<p>Listen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else&nbsp;<a NAME="516"></a>than
the interest of the stronger. And now why do you not me? But of course&nbsp;<a NAME="517"></a>yo
u
won't.&nbsp;<a NAME="518"></a>

<p>Let me first understand you, I replied. justice, as you say, is&nbsp;<a NAME="519"></a>the
interest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?&nbsp;<a NAME="520"></a>You
cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is stronger&nbsp;<a NAME="521"></a>than
we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength,&nbsp;<a NAME="522"></a>that
to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than&nbsp;<a NAME="5
23"></a>he
is, and right and just for us?&nbsp;<a NAME="524"></a>

<p>That's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense&nbsp;<a NAME="525"></a>which
is most damaging to the argument.&nbsp;<a NAME="526"></a>

<p>Not at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them;&nbsp;<a NAME="527"></a>and
I wish that you would be a little clearer.&nbsp;<a NAME="528"></a>

<p>Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ;&nbsp;<a NAME="529"></a>there
are tyrannie
s, and there are democracies, and there are&nbsp;<a NAME="530"></a>aristocracies?&nbsp;<a NAME="531"></a>

<p>Yes, I know.&nbsp;<a NAME="532"></a>
<br>And the government is the ruling power in each state?&nbsp;<a NAME="533"></a>
<br>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="534"></a>
<br>And the different forms of government make laws democratical, aristocratical,&nbsp;<a NAME="535"></a>tyrannical,
with a view to their several interests; and these laws, which&nbsp;<a NAME="536"></a>are
made by them for their own inte
rests, are the justice which they deliver&nbsp;<a NAME="537"></a>to
their subjects, and him who transgresses them they punish as a breaker&nbsp;<a NAME="538"></a>of
the law, and unjust. And that is what I mean when I say that in all&nbsp;<a NAME="539"></a>states
there is the same principle of justice, which is the interest of&nbsp;<a NAME="540"></a>the
government; and as the government must be supposed to have power, the&nbsp;<a NAME="541"></a>only
reasonable conclusion is, that everywhere there is one
 principle of&nbsp;<a NAME="542"></a>justice,
which is the interest of the stronger.&nbsp;<a NAME="543"></a>

<p>Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not&nbsp;<a NAME="544"></a>I
will try to discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you&nbsp;<a NAME="545"></a>have
yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. It&nbsp;<a NAME="546"></a>is
true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are&nbsp;<a NAME="547"></a>added.&nbsp;<a NAME="
548"></a>

<p>A small addition, you must allow, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="549"></a>
<br>Great or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether&nbsp;<a NAME="550"></a>what
you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice is&nbsp;<a NAME="551"></a>interest
of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger'; about this&nbsp;<a NAME="552"></a>addition
I am not so sure, and must therefore consider&nbsp;<a NAME="553"></a>further.&nbsp;<a NAME="554"></a>

<p>Proceed.&nbsp;<a NA ME="555"></a>
<br>I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just or subjects&nbsp;<a NAME="556"></a>to
obey their rulers?&nbsp;<a NAME="557"></a>

<p>I do.&nbsp;<a NAME="558"></a>
<br>But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they sometimes&nbsp;<a NAME="559"></a>liable
to err?&nbsp;<a NAME="560"></a>

<p>To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.&nbsp;<a NAME="561"></a>
<br>Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and&nbsp;<a NAME="562"></a>som
etimes
not?&nbsp;<a NAME="563"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="564"></a>
<br>When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest;&nbsp;<a NAME="565"></a>when
they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit&nbsp;<a NAME="566"></a>that?&nbsp;<a NAME="567"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="568"></a>
<br>And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects, --and&nbsp;<a NAME="569"></a>that
is what you call justice?&nbsp;<a NAME="570"></a>

<p>Doubtless.&nbsp;<a NAME="571
"></a>
<br>Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to&nbsp;<a NAME="572"></a>the
interest of the stronger but the reverse?&nbsp;<a NAME="573"></a>

<p>What is that you are saying? he asked.&nbsp;<a NAME="574"></a>
<br>I am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us consider:&nbsp;<a NAME="575"></a>Have
we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest&nbsp;<a NAME="576"></a>in
what they command, and also that to obey them is justice? Has n
ot that&nbsp;<a NAME="577"></a>been
admitted?&nbsp;<a NAME="578"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="579"></a>
<br>Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest&nbsp;<a NAME="580"></a>of
the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be done&nbsp;<a NAME="581"></a>which
are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice is the obedience&nbsp;<a NAME="582"></a>which
the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O wisest of&nbsp;<a NAME="583"></a>men,
is the
re any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded&nbsp;<a NAME="584"></a>to
do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the injury of the&nbsp;<a NAME="585"></a>stronger?&nbsp;<a NAME="586"></a>

<p>Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.&nbsp;<a NAME="587"></a>

<p>Socrates - CLEITOPHON - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS&nbsp;<a NAME="588"></a>

<p>Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his&nbsp;<a NAME="589"></a>witness.&nbsp;<a NAME="590"></a>

<p>B
ut there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus&nbsp;<a NAME="591"></a>himself
acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for&nbsp;<a NAME="592"></a>their
own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is&nbsp;<a NAME="593"></a>justice.&nbsp;<a NAME="594"></a>

<p>Yes, Polemarchus, --Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what&nbsp;<a NAME="595"></a>was
commanded by their rulers is just.&nbsp;<a NAME="596"></a>

<p>Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that jus
tice is the interest&nbsp;<a NAME="597"></a>of
the stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further&nbsp;<a NAME="598"></a>acknowledged
that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects&nbsp;<a NAME="599"></a>to
do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that justice is&nbsp;<a NAME="600"></a>the
injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.&nbsp;<a NAME="601"></a>

<p>But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger&nbsp;<a NAME="602"></a>w
hat
the stronger thought to be his interest, --this was what the weaker&nbsp;<a NAME="603"></a>had
to do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.&nbsp;<a NAME="604"></a>

<p>Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.&nbsp;<a NAME="605"></a>

<p>Socrates - THRASYMACHUS&nbsp;<a NAME="606"></a>

<p>Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept&nbsp;<a NAME="607"></a>his
statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what&nbsp;<a NAME="608"></a>the
stro
nger thought to be his interest, whether really so or&nbsp;<a NAME="609"></a>not?&nbsp;<a NAME="610"></a>

<p>Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken&nbsp;<a NAME="611"></a>the
stronger at the time when he is mistaken?&nbsp;<a NAME="612"></a>

<p>Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted&nbsp;<a NAME="613"></a>that
the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes&nbsp;<a NAME="614"></a>mistaken.&nbsp;<a NAME="615"></a>

<p>You argue like an i
nformer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example,&nbsp;<a NAME="616"></a>that
he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?&nbsp;<a NAME="617"></a>or
that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian&nbsp;<a NAME="618"></a>at
the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake? True,&nbsp;<a NAME="619"></a>we
say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake,&nbsp;<a NAME="620"></a>but
this is only a way of speaking; for
 the fact is that neither the grammarian&nbsp;<a NAME="621"></a>nor
any other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what&nbsp;<a NAME="622"></a>his
name implies; they none of them err unless their skill fails them,&nbsp;<a NAME="623"></a>and
then they cease to be skilled artists. No artist or sage or ruler errs&nbsp;<a NAME="624"></a>at
the time when he is what his name implies; though he is commonly said&nbsp;<a NAME="625"></a>to
err, and I adopted the common mode of speaking. But to
 be perfectly&nbsp;<a NAME="626"></a>accurate,
since you are such a lover of accuracy, we should say that the&nbsp;<a NAME="627"></a>ruler,
in so far as he is the ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring,&nbsp;<a NAME="628"></a>always
commands that which is for his own interest; and the subject is&nbsp;<a NAME="629"></a>required
to execute his commands; and therefore, as I said at first and&nbsp;<a NAME="630"></a>now
repeat, justice is the interest of the stronger.&nbsp;<a NAME="631"></a>

<p>Indeed, 
Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like&nbsp;<a NAME="632"></a>an
informer?&nbsp;<a NAME="633"></a>

<p>Certainly, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="634"></a>
<br>And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring&nbsp;<a NAME="635"></a>you
in the argument?&nbsp;<a NAME="636"></a>

<p>Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word --I know it; but you&nbsp;<a NAME="637"></a>will
be found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never&nbsp;<a NAME="638"></a>prevail.&nbsp;;<a NAME="639"></a>

<p>I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any misunderstanding&nbsp;<a NAME="640"></a>occurring
between us in future, let me ask, in what sense do you speak&nbsp;<a NAME="641"></a>of
a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were saying, he being the&nbsp;<a NAME="642"></a>superior,
it is just that the inferior should execute --is he a ruler in&nbsp;<a NAME="643"></a>the
popular or in the strict sense of the term?&nbsp;<a NAME="644"></a>

<p>In the strictest of
 all senses, he said. And now cheat and play&nbsp;<a NAME="645"></a>the
informer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never&nbsp;<a NAME="646"></a>will
be able, never.&nbsp;<a NAME="647"></a>

<p>And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and&nbsp;<a NAME="648"></a>cheat,
Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.&nbsp;<a NAME="649"></a>

<p>Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you&nbsp;<a NAME="650"></a>failed.&nbsp;<a NAME="651"></a>
<br>Enough, I
 said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should&nbsp;<a NAME="652"></a>ask
you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which&nbsp;<a NAME="653"></a>you
are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? And remember&nbsp;<a NAME="654"></a>that
I am now speaking of the true physician.&nbsp;<a NAME="655"></a>

<p>A healer of the sick, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="656"></a>
<br>And the pilot --that is to say, the true pilot --is he a captain of&nbsp;<a NAME="657"></a>sai
lors
or a mere sailor?&nbsp;<a NAME="658"></a>

<p>A captain of sailors.&nbsp;<a NAME="659"></a>
<br>The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into&nbsp;<a NAME="660"></a>account;
neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which he&nbsp;<a NAME="661"></a>is
distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant of&nbsp;<a NAME="662"></a>his
skill and of his authority over the sailors.&nbsp;<a NAME="663"></a>

<p>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="664"></a>

<br>Now, I said, every art has an interest?&nbsp;<a NAME="665"></a>
<br>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="666"></a>
<br>For which the art has to consider and provide?&nbsp;<a NAME="667"></a>
<br>Yes, that is the aim of art.&nbsp;<a NAME="668"></a>
<br>And the interest of any art is the perfection of it --this and nothing&nbsp;<a NAME="669"></a>else?&nbsp;<a NAME="670"></a>

<p>What do you mean?&nbsp;<a NAME="671"></a>
<br>I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.&nbsp;<a NAME="672"></a>Suppose
you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has wants,&nbsp;<a NAME="673"></a>I
should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body may be ill and&nbsp;<a NAME="674"></a>require
to be cured, and has therefore interests to which the art of medicine&nbsp;<a NAME="675"></a>ministers;
and this is the origin and intention of medicine, as you will&nbsp;<a NAME="676"></a>acknowledge.
Am I not right?&nbsp;<a NAME="677"></a>

<p>Quite right, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="678"></a>
<b R>But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in&nbsp;<a NAME="679"></a>any
quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the&nbsp;<a NAME="680"></a>ear
fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for&nbsp;<a NAME="681"></a>the
interests of seeing and hearing --has art in itself, I say, any similar&nbsp;<a NAME="682"></a>liability
to fault or defect, and does every art require another supplementary&nbsp;<a NAME="683"></a>art
to provide for its 
interests, and that another and another without&nbsp;<a NAME="684"></a>end?
Or have the arts to look only after their own interests? Or have they&nbsp;<a NAME="685"></a>no
need either of themselves or of another? --having no faults or defects,&nbsp;<a NAME="686"></a>they
have no need to correct them, either by the exercise of their own&nbsp;<a NAME="687"></a>art
or of any other; they have only to consider the interest of their subject-matter.&nbsp;<a NAME="688"></a>For
every art remains pure and faultl
ess while remaining true --that is&nbsp;<a NAME="689"></a>to
say, while perfect and unimpaired. Take the words in your precise sense,&nbsp;<a NAME="690"></a>and
tell me whether I am not right.&quot;&nbsp;<a NAME="691"></a>

<p>Yes, clearly.&nbsp;<a NAME="692"></a>
<br>Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the interest&nbsp;<a NAME="693"></a>of
the body?&nbsp;<a NAME="694"></a>

<p>True, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="695"></a>
<br>Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests o
f the art&nbsp;<a NAME="696"></a>of
horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts&nbsp;<a NAME="697"></a>care
for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that which&nbsp;<a NAME="698"></a>is
the subject of their art?&nbsp;<a NAME="699"></a>

<p>True, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="700"></a>
<br>But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of&nbsp;<a NAME="701"></a>their
own subjects?&nbsp;<a NAME="702"></a>

<p>To this he assented with a good deal
 of reluctance.&nbsp;<a NAME="703"></a>
<br>Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of&nbsp;<a NAME="704"></a>the
stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and&nbsp;<a NAME="705"></a>weaker?&nbsp;<a NAME="706"></a>

<p>He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally&nbsp;<a NAME="707"></a>acquiesced.&nbsp;<a NAME="708"></a>

<p>Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician,&nbsp;<a NAME="709"></a>considers
his own good in w
hat he prescribes, but the good of his patient;&nbsp;<a NAME="710"></a>for
the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject,&nbsp;<a NAME="711"></a>and
is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?&nbsp;<a NAME="712"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="713"></a>
<br>And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler&nbsp;<a NAME="714"></a>of
sailors and not a mere sailor?&nbsp;<a NAME="715"></a>

<p>That has been admitted.&nbsp;<a NAME="716"></a>
<br>And such a pi
lot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest&nbsp;<a NAME="717"></a>of
the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's&nbsp;<a NAME="718"></a>interest?&nbsp;<a NAME="719"></a>

<p>He gave a reluctant 'Yes.'&nbsp;<a NAME="720"></a>
<br>Then, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so&nbsp;<a NAME="721"></a>far
as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest,&nbsp;<a NAME="722"></a>but
always what is for the interest of his subject or su
itable to his art;&nbsp;<a NAME="723"></a>to
that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which he says&nbsp;<a NAME="724"></a>and
does.&nbsp;<a NAME="725"></a>

<p>When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw&nbsp;<a NAME="726"></a>that
the definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<a NAME="727"></a>instead
of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a&nbsp;<a NAME="728"></a>nurse?&nbsp;<a NAME="729"></a>

<p>Why do you ask such
 a question, I said, when you ought rather to&nbsp;<a NAME="730"></a>be
answering?&nbsp;<a NAME="731"></a>

<p>Because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she&nbsp;<a NAME="732"></a>has
not even taught you to know the shepherd from the&nbsp;<a NAME="733"></a>sheep.&nbsp;<a NAME="734"></a>

<p>What makes you say that? I replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="735"></a>
<br>Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the&nbsp;<a NAME="736"></a>sheep
or oxen with a view to their ow
n good and not to the good of himself&nbsp;<a NAME="737"></a>or
his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of states, if they&nbsp;<a NAME="738"></a>are
true rulers, never think of their subjects as sheep, and that they&nbsp;<a NAME="739"></a>are
not studying their own advantage day and night. Oh, no; and so entirely&nbsp;<a NAME="740"></a>astray
are you in your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know&nbsp;<a NAME="741"></a>that
justice and the just are in reality another's good; t
hat is to say,&nbsp;<a NAME="742"></a>the
interest of the ruler and stronger, and the loss of the subject and&nbsp;<a NAME="743"></a>servant;
and injustice the opposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly&nbsp;<a NAME="744"></a>simple
and just: he is the stronger, and his subjects do what is for his&nbsp;<a NAME="745"></a>interest,
and minister to his happiness, which is very far from being their&nbsp;<a NAME="746"></a>own.
Consider further, most foolish Socrates, that the just is always a&nbsp;<a N AME="747"></a>loser
in comparison with the unjust. First of all, in private contracts:&nbsp;<a NAME="748"></a>wherever
the unjust is the partner of the just you will find that, when&nbsp;<a NAME="749"></a>the
partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has always more and the just&nbsp;<a NAME="750"></a>less.
Secondly, in their dealings with the State: when there is an income&nbsp;<a NAME="751"></a>tax,
the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount&nbsp;<a NAME="752"></a>of
income; an
d when there is anything to be received the one gains nothing&nbsp;<a NAME="753"></a>and
the other much. Observe also what happens when they take an office;&nbsp;<a NAME="754"></a>there
is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other&nbsp;<a NAME="755"></a>losses,
and getting nothing out of the public, because he is just; moreover&nbsp;<a NAME="756"></a>he
is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them&nbsp;<a NAME="757"></a>in
unlawful ways. But all this is reve
rsed in the case of the unjust man.&nbsp;<a NAME="758"></a>I
am speaking, as before, of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage&nbsp;<a NAME="759"></a>of
the unjust is more apparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen&nbsp;<a NAME="760"></a>if
we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the criminal is the&nbsp;<a NAME="761"></a>happiest
of men, and the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice&nbsp;<a NAME="762"></a>are
the most miserable --that is to say tyranny, which by f
raud and force&nbsp;<a NAME="763"></a>takes
away the property of others, not little by little but wholesale;&nbsp;<a NAME="764"></a>comprehending
in one, things sacred as well as profane, private and public;&nbsp;<a NAME="765"></a>for
which acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating any one of them&nbsp;<a NAME="766"></a>singly,
he would be punished and incur great disgrace --they who do such&nbsp;<a NAME="767"></a>wrong
in particular cases are called robbers of temples, and man-stealers&nbsp;<a N AME="768"></a>and
burglars and swindlers and thieves. But when a man besides taking away&nbsp;<a NAME="769"></a>the
money of the citizens has made slaves of them, then, instead of these&nbsp;<a NAME="770"></a>names
of reproach, he is termed happy and blessed, not only by the citizens&nbsp;<a NAME="771"></a>but
by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice.&nbsp;<a NAME="772"></a>For
mankind censure injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of&nbsp;<a NAME="773"></a>it
and 
not because they shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have&nbsp;<a NAME="774"></a>shown,
Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more strength&nbsp;<a NAME="775"></a>and
freedom and mastery than justice; and, as I said at first, justice&nbsp;<a NAME="776"></a>is
the interest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit&nbsp;<a NAME="777"></a>and
interest.&nbsp;<a NAME="778"></a>

<p>Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bathman,&nbsp;<a NAME="779"></a>delu
ged
our ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company&nbsp;<a NAME="780"></a>would
not let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his position;&nbsp;<a NAME="781"></a>and
I myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us. Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<a NAME="782"></a>I
said to him, excellent man, how suggestive are your remarks! And are&nbsp;<a NAME="783"></a>you
going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether&nbsp;<a NAME="784"></a>they
are true or n
ot? Is the attempt to determine the way of man's life&nbsp;<a NAME="785"></a>so
small a matter in your eyes --to determine how life may be passed by&nbsp;<a NAME="786"></a>each
one of us to the greatest advantage?&nbsp;<a NAME="787"></a>

<p>And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the&nbsp;<a NAME="788"></a>enquiry?&nbsp;<a NAME="789"></a>

<p>You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about&nbsp;<a NAME="790"></a>us,
Thrasymachus --whether we live better or worse fro
m not knowing what&nbsp;<a NAME="791"></a>you
say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. Prithee, friend,&nbsp;<a NAME="792"></a>do
not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any benefit&nbsp;<a NAME="793"></a>which
you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own part I openly&nbsp;<a NAME="794"></a>declare
that I am not convinced, and that I do not believe injustice to&nbsp;<a NAME="795"></a>be
more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled and allowed to have&nbsp;<a NAME="796"></a>free
play. For, granting that there may be an unjust man who is able to&nbsp;<a NAME="797"></a>commit
injustice either by fraud or force, still this does not convince&nbsp;<a NAME="798"></a>me
of the superior advantage of injustice, and there may be others who&nbsp;<a NAME="799"></a>are
in the same predicament with myself. Perhaps we may be wrong; if so,&nbsp;<a NAME="800"></a>you
in your wisdom should convince us that we are mistaken in preferring&nbsp;<a NAME="801"></a>justice
to inj
ustice.&nbsp;<a NAME="802"></a>

<p>And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced&nbsp;<a NAME="803"></a>by
what I have just said; what more can I do for you? Would you have me&nbsp;<a NAME="804"></a>put
the proof bodily into your souls?&nbsp;<a NAME="805"></a>

<p>Heaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or,&nbsp;<a NAME="806"></a>if
you change, change openly and let there be no deception. For I must&nbsp;<a NAME="807"></a>remark,
Thrasymachus, if you 
will recall what was previously said, that&nbsp;<a NAME="808"></a>although
you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you&nbsp;<a NAME="809"></a>did
not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought&nbsp;<a NAME="810"></a>that
the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their&nbsp;<a NAME="811"></a>own
good, but like a mere diner or banqueter with a view to the pleasures&nbsp;<a NAME="812"></a>of
the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the 
market, and not as&nbsp;<a NAME="813"></a>a
shepherd. Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the&nbsp;<a NAME="814"></a>good
of his subjects; he has only to provide the best for them, since the&nbsp;<a NAME="815"></a>perfection
of the art is already ensured whenever all the requirements&nbsp;<a NAME="816"></a>of
it are satisfied. And that was what I was saying just now about the&nbsp;<a NAME="817"></a>ruler.
I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered as ruler, whether&nbsp;<a NAME="818"></a>in
a state or in private life, could only regard the good of his flock&nbsp;<a NAME="819"></a>or
subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states, that&nbsp;<a NAME="820"></a>is
to say, the true rulers, like being in authority.&nbsp;<a NAME="821"></a>

<p>Think! Nay, I am sure of it.&nbsp;<a NAME="822"></a>
<br>Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly&nbsp;<a NAME="823"></a>without
payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the advan
tage&nbsp;<a NAME="824"></a>not
of themselves but of others? Let me ask you a question: Are not the&nbsp;<a NAME="825"></a>several
arts different, by reason of their each having a separate function?&nbsp;<a NAME="826"></a>And,
my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we may make&nbsp;<a NAME="827"></a>a
little progress.&nbsp;<a NAME="828"></a>

<p>Yes, that is the difference, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="829"></a>
<br>And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one&amp;nb
sp;<a NAME="830"></a>--medicine,
for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea, and&nbsp;<a NAME="831"></a>so
on?&nbsp;<a NAME="832"></a>

<p>Yes, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="833"></a>
<br>And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but&nbsp;<a NAME="834"></a>we
do not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot&nbsp;<a NAME="835"></a>is
to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the pilot&nbsp;<a NAME="836"></a>may
be improved by a se
a voyage. You would not be inclined to say, would&nbsp;<a NAME="837"></a>you,
that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt&nbsp;<a NAME="838"></a>your
exact use of language?&nbsp;<a NAME="839"></a>

<p>Certainly not.&nbsp;<a NAME="840"></a>
<br>Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not&nbsp;<a NAME="841"></a>say
that the art of payment is medicine?&nbsp;<a NAME="842"></a>

<p>I should say not.&nbsp;<a NAME="843"></a>
<br>Nor would you say that medi
cine is the art of receiving pay because&nbsp;<a NAME="844"></a>a
man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?&nbsp;<a NAME="845"></a>

<p>Certainly not.&nbsp;<a NAME="846"></a>
<br>And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially&nbsp;<a NAME="847"></a>confined
to the art?&nbsp;<a NAME="848"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="849"></a>
<br>Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is&nbsp;<a NAME="850"></a>to
be attributed to something of which they all have t
he common&nbsp;<a NAME="851"></a>use?&nbsp;<a NAME="852"></a>

<p>True, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="853"></a>
<br>And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is&nbsp;<a NAME="854"></a>gained
by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art professed&nbsp;<a NAME="855"></a>by
him?&nbsp;<a NAME="856"></a>

<p>He gave a reluctant assent to this.&nbsp;<a NAME="857"></a>
<br>Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective&nbsp;<a NAME="858"></a>arts.

But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives health, and&nbsp;<a NAME="859"></a>the
art of the builder builds a house, another art attends them which is&nbsp;<a NAME="860"></a>the
art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting&nbsp;<a NAME="861"></a>that
over which they preside, but would the artist receive any benefit&nbsp;<a NAME="862"></a>from
his art unless he were paid as well?&nbsp;<a NAME="863"></a>

<p>I suppose not.&nbsp;<a NAME="864"></a>
<br>But doe
s he therefore confer no benefit when he works for&nbsp;<a NAME="865"></a>nothing?&nbsp;<a NAME="866"></a>
<br>Certainly, he confers a benefit.&nbsp;<a NAME="867"></a>
<br>Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts&nbsp;<a NAME="868"></a>nor
governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before&nbsp;<a NAME="869"></a>saying,
they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are&nbsp;<a NAME="870"></a>the
weaker and not the stronger --to their good t
hey attend and not to&nbsp;<a NAME="871"></a>the
good of the superior.&nbsp;<a NAME="872"></a>

<p>And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus, why, as I was just&nbsp;<a NAME="873"></a>now
saying, no one is willing to govern; because no one likes to take in&nbsp;<a NAME="874"></a>hand
the reformation of evils which are not his concern without remuneration.&nbsp;<a NAME="875"></a>For,
in the execution of his work, and in giving his orders to another,&nbsp;<a NAME="876"></a>the
true artist does not r
egard his own interest, but always that of his&nbsp;<a NAME="877"></a>subjects;
and therefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they&nbsp;<a NAME="878"></a>must
be paid in one of three modes of payment: money, or honour, or a penalty&nbsp;<a NAME="879"></a>for
refusing.&nbsp;<a NAME="880"></a>

<p>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<a NAME="881"></a>

<p>What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of&nbsp;<a NAME="882"></a>payment
are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I 
do not understand,&nbsp;<a NAME="883"></a>or
how a penalty can be a payment.&nbsp;<a NAME="884"></a>

<p>You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment&nbsp;<a NAME="885"></a>which
to the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know&nbsp;<a NAME="886"></a>that
ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a&nbsp;<a NAME="887"></a>disgrace?&nbsp;<a NAME="888"></a>

<p>Very true.&nbsp;<a NAME="889"></a>
<br>And for this reason, I said, money and honour have n
o attraction for&nbsp;<a NAME="890"></a>them;
good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing&nbsp;<a NAME="891"></a>and
so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves&nbsp;<a NAME="892"></a>out
of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being ambitious&nbsp;<a NAME="893"></a>they
do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them,&nbsp;<a NAME="894"></a>and
they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment. And this,&nbsp;;<a NAME="895"></a>as
I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness to take office, instead&nbsp;<a NAME="896"></a>of
waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst&nbsp;<a NAME="897"></a>part
of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled&nbsp;<a NAME="898"></a>by
one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive,&nbsp;<a NAME="899"></a>induces
the good to take office, not because they would, but because they&nbsp;<a NAME="900"></a>cannot


help --not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit&nbsp;<a NAME="901"></a>or
enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because they are not able&nbsp;<a NAME="902"></a>to
commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves,&nbsp;<a NAME="903"></a>or
indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a city were composed&nbsp;<a NAME="904"></a>entirely
of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of&nbsp;<a NAME="905"></a>contention
as to obtain offic
e is at present; then we should have plain&nbsp;<a NAME="906"></a>proof
that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest,&nbsp;<a NAME="907"></a>but
that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather&nbsp;<a NAME="908"></a>to
receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring&nbsp;<a NAME="909"></a>one.
So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the interest&nbsp;<a NAME="910"></a>of
the stronger. This latter question need not 
be further discussed at&nbsp;<a NAME="911"></a>present;
but when Thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more&nbsp;<a NAME="912"></a>advantageous
than that of the just, his new statement appears to me to&nbsp;<a NAME="913"></a>be
of a far more serious character. Which of us has spoken truly? And which&nbsp;<a NAME="914"></a>sort
of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?&nbsp;<a NAME="915"></a>

<p>I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous,&nbsp;<a NAME="916"></a>he
answered.
&nbsp;<a NAME="917"></a>

<p>Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus&nbsp;<a NAME="918"></a>was
rehearsing?&nbsp;<a NAME="919"></a>

<p>Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced&nbsp;<a NAME="920"></a>me.&nbsp;<a NAME="921"></a>
<br>Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that&nbsp;<a NAME="922"></a>he
is saying what is not true?&nbsp;<a NAME="923"></a>

<p>Most certainly, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="924"></a>
<br>If, I said, he makes a 
set speech and we make another recounting all&nbsp;<a NAME="925"></a>the
advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must&nbsp;<a NAME="926"></a>be
a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side,&nbsp;<a NAME="927"></a>and
in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed in our&nbsp;<a NAME="928"></a>enquiry
as we lately did, by making admissions to one another, we shall&nbsp;<a NAME="929"></a>unite
the offices of judge and advocate in our own pers
ons.&nbsp;<a NAME="930"></a>

<p>Very good, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="931"></a>
<br>And which method do I understand you to prefer? I&nbsp;<a NAME="932"></a>said.&nbsp;<a NAME="933"></a>
<br>That which you propose.&nbsp;<a NAME="934"></a>
<br>Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning&nbsp;<a NAME="935"></a>and
answer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect&nbsp;<a NAME="936"></a>justice?&nbsp;<a NAME="937"></a>

<p>Socrates - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS&amp;nbs
p;<a NAME="938"></a>

<p>Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my&nbsp;<a NAME="939"></a>reasons.&nbsp;<a NAME="940"></a>
<br>And what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue&nbsp;<a NAME="941"></a>and
the other vice?&nbsp;<a NAME="942"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="943"></a>
<br>I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice&nbsp;<a NAME="944"></a>vice?&nbsp;<a NAME="945"></a>
<br>What a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice&nbsp;<a NAME="946"></a>to
be profitable and justice not.&nbsp;<a NAME="947"></a>

<p>What else then would you say?&nbsp;<a NAME="948"></a>
<br>The opposite, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="949"></a>
<br>And would you call justice vice?&nbsp;<a NAME="950"></a>
<br>No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.&nbsp;<a NAME="951"></a>
<br>Then would you call injustice malignity?&nbsp;<a NAME="952"></a>
<br>No; I would rather say discretion.&nbsp;<a NAME="953"></a>
<br>And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and g
ood?&nbsp;<a NAME="954"></a>
<br>Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly&nbsp;<a NAME="955"></a>unjust,
and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but perhaps&nbsp;<a NAME="956"></a>you
imagine me to be talking of cutpurses.&nbsp;<a NAME="957"></a>

<p>Even this profession if undetected has advantages, though they&nbsp;<a NAME="958"></a>are
not to be compared with those of which I was just now&nbsp;<a NAME="959"></a>speaking.&nbsp;<a NAME="960"></a>

<p>I do 
not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<a NAME="961"></a>I
replied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice&nbsp;<a NAME="962"></a>with
wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.&nbsp;<a NAME="963"></a>

<p>Certainly I do so class them.&nbsp;<a NAME="964"></a>
<br>Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground;&nbsp;<a NAME="965"></a>for
if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had been&nbsp;<a NAME="966"></a>admitted
by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer might&nbsp;<a NAME="967"></a>have
been given to you on received principles; but now I perceive that&nbsp;<a NAME="968"></a>you
will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust you will&nbsp;<a NAME="969"></a>attribute
all the qualities which were attributed by us before to the just,&nbsp;<a NAME="970"></a>seeing
that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and&nbsp;<a NAME="971"></a>virtue.&nbsp;<a NAME="97
2"></a>

<p>You have guessed most infallibly, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="973"></a>
<br>Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument&nbsp;<a NAME="974"></a>so
long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are speaking&nbsp;<a NAME="975"></a>your
real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are not&nbsp;<a NAME="976"></a>amusing
yourself at our expense.&nbsp;<a NAME="977"></a>

<p>I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you? --to refute&nbsp;
<a NAME="978"></a>the
argument is your business.&nbsp;<a NAME="979"></a>

<p>Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so&nbsp;<a NAME="980"></a>good
as answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any&nbsp;<a NAME="981"></a>advantage
over the just?&nbsp;<a NAME="982"></a>

<p>Far otherwise; if he did would not be the simple, amusing creature&nbsp;<a NAME="983"></a>which
he is.&nbsp;<a NAME="984"></a>

<p>And would he try to go beyond just action?&nbsp;<a NAME="9
85"></a>
<br>He would not.&nbsp;<a NAME="986"></a>
<br>And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust;&nbsp;<a NAME="987"></a>would
that be considered by him as just or unjust?&nbsp;<a NAME="988"></a>

<p>He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but&nbsp;<a NAME="989"></a>he
would not be able.&nbsp;<a NAME="990"></a>

<p>Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point.&nbsp;<a NAME="991"></a>My
question is only whether the just man, w
hile refusing to have more than&nbsp;<a NAME="992"></a>another
just man, would wish and claim to have more than the&nbsp;<a NAME="993"></a>unjust?&nbsp;<a NAME="994"></a>

<p>Yes, he would.&nbsp;<a NAME="995"></a>
<br>And what of the unjust --does he claim to have more than the just man&nbsp;<a NAME="996"></a>and
to do more than is just&nbsp;<a NAME="997"></a>

<p>Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all&nbsp;<a NAME="998"></a>men.&nbsp;<a NAME="999"></a>
<br>And the unjust man will s
trive and struggle to obtain more than the&nbsp;<a NAME="1000"></a>unjust
man or action, in order that he may have more than&nbsp;<a NAME="1001"></a>all?&nbsp;<a NAME="1002"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="1003"></a>
<br>We may put the matter thus, I said --the just does not desire more&nbsp;<a NAME="1004"></a>than
his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more&nbsp;<a NAME="1005"></a>than
both his like and his unlike?&nbsp;<a NAME="1006"></a>

<p>Nothing, he said, can be better tha
n that statement.&nbsp;<a NAME="1007"></a>
<br>And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is&nbsp;<a NAME="1008"></a>neither?&nbsp;<a NAME="1009"></a>
<br>Good again, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1010"></a>
<br>And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike&nbsp;<a NAME="1011"></a>them?&nbsp;<a NAME="1012"></a>

<p>Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those&nbsp;<a NAME="1013"></a>who
are of a certain nature; he who is not, not.&nbsp;<a NAME="1014"></a>

<p>Each 
of them, I said, is such as his like is?&nbsp;<a NAME="1015"></a>
<br>Certainly, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="1016"></a>
<br>Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts:&nbsp;<a NAME="1017"></a>you
would admit that one man is a musician and another not a&nbsp;<a NAME="1018"></a>musician?&nbsp;<a NAME="1019"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1020"></a>
<br>And which is wise and which is foolish?&nbsp;<a NAME="1021"></a>
<br>Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is
&nbsp;<a NAME="1022"></a>foolish.&nbsp;<a NAME="1023"></a>

<p>And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he&nbsp;<a NAME="1024"></a>is
foolish?&nbsp;<a NAME="1025"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1026"></a>
<br>And you would say the same sort of thing of the&nbsp;<a NAME="1027"></a>physician?&nbsp;<a NAME="1028"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1029"></a>
<br>And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts&nbsp;<a NAME="1030"></a>the
lyre would desire or claim to ex
ceed or go beyond a musician in the&nbsp;<a NAME="1031"></a>tightening
and loosening the strings?&nbsp;<a NAME="1032"></a>

<p>I do not think that he would.&nbsp;<a NAME="1033"></a>
<br>But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?&nbsp;<a NAME="1034"></a>
<br>Of course.&nbsp;<a NAME="1035"></a>
<br>And what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and drinks&nbsp;<a NAME="1036"></a>would
he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of&nbsp;<a NAME="1037"></a>medicine?&amp;n
bsp;<a NAME="1038"></a>

<p>He would not.&nbsp;<a NAME="1039"></a>
<br>But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?&nbsp;<a NAME="1040"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1041"></a>
<br>And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think&nbsp;<a NAME="1042"></a>that
any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying&nbsp;<a NAME="1043"></a>or
doing more than another man who has knowledge. Would he not rather say&nbsp;<a NAME="1044"></a>or
do the same as his like in 
the same case?&nbsp;<a NAME="1045"></a>

<p>That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.&nbsp;<a NAME="1046"></a>
<br>And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either&nbsp;<a NAME="1047"></a>the
knowing or the ignorant?&nbsp;<a NAME="1048"></a>

<p>I dare say.&nbsp;<a NAME="1049"></a>
<br>And the knowing is wise?&nbsp;<a NAME="1050"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1051"></a>
<br>And the wise is good?&nbsp;<a NAME="1052"></a>
<br>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="1053"></a>
<br>Then the wise and goo
d will not desire to gain more than his like,&nbsp;<a NAME="1054"></a>but
more than his unlike and opposite?&nbsp;<a NAME="1055"></a>

<p>I suppose so.&nbsp;<a NAME="1056"></a>
<br>Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than&nbsp;<a NAME="1057"></a>both?&nbsp;<a NAME="1058"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1059"></a>
<br>But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both&nbsp;<a NAME="1060"></a>his
like and unlike? Were not these your words? They&nbsp;<a NAME="1061"></a>were
.&nbsp;<a NAME="1062"></a>

<p>They were.&nbsp;<a NAME="1063"></a>
<br>And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his&nbsp;<a NAME="1064"></a>unlike?&nbsp;<a NAME="1065"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1066"></a>
<br>Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil&nbsp;<a NAME="1067"></a>and
ignorant?&nbsp;<a NAME="1068"></a>

<p>That is the inference.&nbsp;<a NAME="1069"></a>
<br>And each of them is such as his like is?&nbsp;<a NAME="1070"></a>
<br>That was
 admitted.&nbsp;<a NAME="1071"></a>
<br>Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil&nbsp;<a NAME="1072"></a>and
ignorant.&nbsp;<a NAME="1073"></a>

<p>Thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as I repeat&nbsp;<a NAME="1074"></a>them,
but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's day, and the perspiration&nbsp;<a NAME="1075"></a>poured
from him in torrents; and then I saw what I had never seen before,&nbsp;<a NAME="1076"></a>Thrasymachus
blushing. As we were 
now agreed that justice was virtue and&nbsp;<a NAME="1077"></a>wisdom,
and injustice vice and ignorance, I proceeded to another&nbsp;<a NAME="1078"></a>point:&nbsp;<a NAME="1079"></a>

<p>Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were&nbsp;<a NAME="1080"></a>we
not also saying that injustice had strength; do you&nbsp;<a NAME="1081"></a>remember?&nbsp;<a NAME="1082"></a>

<p>Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of&nbsp;<a NAME="1083"></a>what
you are saying or 
have no answer; if however I were to answer, you&nbsp;<a NAME="1084"></a>would
be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit&nbsp;<a NAME="1085"></a>me
to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer&nbsp;<a NAME="1086"></a>'Very
good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes'&nbsp;<a NAME="1087"></a>and
'No.'&nbsp;<a NAME="1088"></a>

<p>Certainly not, I said, if contrary to your real&nbsp;<a NAME="1089"></a>opinion.&nbsp;<a NAME="1090
"></a>
<br>Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak.&nbsp;<a NAME="1091"></a>What
else would you have?&nbsp;<a NAME="1092"></a>

<p>Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will&nbsp;<a NAME="1093"></a>ask
and you shall answer.&nbsp;<a NAME="1094"></a>

<p>Proceed.&nbsp;<a NAME="1095"></a>
<br>Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order that&nbsp;<a NAME="1096"></a>our
examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be
&nbsp;<a NAME="1097"></a>carried
on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is stronger and&nbsp;<a NAME="1098"></a>more
powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified with&nbsp;<a NAME="1099"></a>wisdom
and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice, if injustice&nbsp;<a NAME="1100"></a>is
ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one. But I want to&nbsp;<a NAME="1101"></a>view
the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You would not deny that&nbsp;<a NAME="1102"></a>a
state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states,&nbsp;<a NAME="1103"></a>or
may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in&nbsp;<a NAME="1104"></a>subjection?&nbsp;<a NAME="1105"></a>

<p>True, he replied; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust&nbsp;<a NAME="1106"></a>state
will be most likely to do so.&nbsp;<a NAME="1107"></a>

<p>I know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further&nbsp;<a NAME="1108"></a>consider

is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior state&nbsp;<a NAME="1109"></a>can
exist or be exercised without justice.&nbsp;<a NAME="1110"></a>

<p>If you are right in you view, and justice is wisdom, then only&nbsp;<a NAME="1111"></a>with
justice; but if I am right, then without justice.&nbsp;<a NAME="1112"></a>

<p>I am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent&nbsp;<a NAME="1113"></a>and
dissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.&nbsp;<a NAME="1114"></a>


<p>That is out of civility to you, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="1115"></a>
<br>You are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to&nbsp;<a NAME="1116"></a>inform
me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of robbers&nbsp;<a NAME="1117"></a>and
thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if they injured&nbsp;<a NAME="1118"></a>one
another?&nbsp;<a NAME="1119"></a>

<p>No indeed, he said, they could not.&nbsp;<a NAME="1120"></a>
<br>But if they abstained from 
injuring one another, then they might act&nbsp;<a NAME="1121"></a>together
better?&nbsp;<a NAME="1122"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1123"></a>
<br>And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting,&nbsp;<a NAME="1124"></a>and
justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true,&nbsp;<a NAME="1125"></a>Thrasymachus?&nbsp;<a NAME="1126"></a>

<p>I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with&nbsp;<a NAME="1127"></a>you.&nbsp;<a NAME="1128"></a>
<br>How good of you, 
I said; but I should like to know also whether injustice,&nbsp;<a NAME="1129"></a>having
this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing, among slaves&nbsp;<a NAME="1130"></a>or
among freemen, will not make them hate one another and set them at variance&nbsp;<a NAME="1131"></a>and
render them incapable of common action?&nbsp;<a NAME="1132"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="1133"></a>
<br>And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and&nbsp;<a NAME="1134"></a>fight,
and become 
enemies to one another and to the&nbsp;<a NAME="1135"></a>just&nbsp;<a NAME="1136"></a>

<p>They will.&nbsp;<a NAME="1137"></a>
<br>And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom&nbsp;<a NAME="1138"></a>say
that she loses or that she retains her natural power?&nbsp;<a NAME="1139"></a>

<p>Let us assume that she retains her power.&nbsp;<a NAME="1140"></a>
<br>Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that&nbsp;<a NAME="1141"></a>wherever
she takes up her abo
de, whether in a city, in an army, in a family,&nbsp;<a NAME="1142"></a>or
in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered incapable of&nbsp;<a NAME="1143"></a>united
action by reason of sedition and distraction; and does it not become&nbsp;<a NAME="1144"></a>its
own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it, and with the just?&nbsp;<a NAME="1145"></a>Is
not this the case?&nbsp;<a NAME="1146"></a>

<p>Yes, certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="1147"></a>
<br>And is not injustice equally fatal when e
xisting in a single person;&nbsp;<a NAME="1148"></a>in
the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not&nbsp;<a NAME="1149"></a>at
unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to himself&nbsp;<a NAME="1150"></a>and
the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus?&nbsp;<a NAME="1151"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1152"></a>
<br>And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?&nbsp;<a NAME="1153"></a>
<br>Granted that they are.&nbsp;<a NAME="1154"></a>
<br>But if so, the
 unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will&nbsp;<a NAME="1155"></a>be
their friend?&nbsp;<a NAME="1156"></a>

<p>Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will&nbsp;<a NAME="1157"></a>not
oppose you, lest I should displease the company.&nbsp;<a NAME="1158"></a>

<p>Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder&nbsp;<a NAME="1159"></a>of
my repast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser&nbsp;<a NAME="1160"></a>and
better and ab
ler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable&nbsp;<a NAME="1161"></a>of
common action; nay ing at more, that to speak as we did of men who are&nbsp;<a NAME="1162"></a>evil
acting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for&nbsp;<a NAME="1163"></a>if
they had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one another;&nbsp;<a NAME="1164"></a>but
it is evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in&nbsp;<a NAME="1165"></a>them,
which enabled them to combine; i
f there had not been they would have&nbsp;<a NAME="1166"></a>injured
one another as well as their victims; they were but half --villains&nbsp;<a NAME="1167"></a>in
their enterprises; for had they been whole villains, and utterly unjust,&nbsp;<a NAME="1168"></a>they
would have been utterly incapable of action. That, as I believe, is&nbsp;<a NAME="1169"></a>the
truth of the matter, and not what you said at first. But whether the&nbsp;<a NAME="1170"></a>just
have a better and happier life than the unjust 
is a further question&nbsp;<a NAME="1171"></a>which
we also proposed to consider. I think that they have, and for the&nbsp;<a NAME="1172"></a>reasons
which to have given; but still I should like to examine further,&nbsp;<a NAME="1173"></a>for
no light matter is at stake, nothing less than the rule of human&nbsp;<a NAME="1174"></a>life.&nbsp;<a NAME="1175"></a>

<p>Proceed.&nbsp;<a NAME="1176"></a>
<br>I will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse&nbsp;<a NAME="1177"></a>has
some
 end?&nbsp;<a NAME="1178"></a>

<p>I should.&nbsp;<a NAME="1179"></a>
<br>And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could&nbsp;<a NAME="1180"></a>not
be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other&nbsp;<a NAME="1181"></a>thing?&nbsp;<a NAME="1182"></a>

<p>I do not understand, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1183"></a>
<br>Let me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?&nbsp;<a NAME="1184"></a>
<br>Certainly not.&nbsp;<a NAME="1185"></a>
<br>Or hear, except with the ear?
&nbsp;<a NAME="1186"></a>
<br>No.&nbsp;<a NAME="1187"></a>
<br>These then may be truly said to be the ends of these&nbsp;<a NAME="1188"></a>organs?&nbsp;<a NAME="1189"></a>
<br>They may.&nbsp;<a NAME="1190"></a>
<br>But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and&nbsp;<a NAME="1191"></a>in
many other ways?&nbsp;<a NAME="1192"></a>

<p>Of course.&nbsp;<a NAME="1193"></a>
<br>And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the&nbsp;<a NAME="1194"></a>purpose?&nbsp;<a NAME="11
95"></a>
<br>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="1196"></a>
<br>May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?&nbsp;<a NAME="1197"></a>
<br>We may.&nbsp;<a NAME="1198"></a>
<br>Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning&nbsp;<a NAME="1199"></a>when
I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which&nbsp;<a NAME="1200"></a>could
not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other&nbsp;<a NAME="1201"></a>thing?&nbsp;<a NAME="1202"></a>

<p>I understan
d your meaning, he said, and assent.&nbsp;<a NAME="1203"></a>
<br>And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need&nbsp;<a NAME="1204"></a>I
ask again whether the eye has an end?&nbsp;<a NAME="1205"></a>

<p>It has.&nbsp;<a NAME="1206"></a>
<br>And has not the eye an excellence?&nbsp;<a NAME="1207"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1208"></a>
<br>And the ear has an end and an excellence also?&nbsp;<a NAME="1209"></a>
<br>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="1210"></a>
<br>And the same is true of all oth
er things; they have each of them an&nbsp;<a NAME="1211"></a>end
and a special excellence?&nbsp;<a NAME="1212"></a>

<p>That is so.&nbsp;<a NAME="1213"></a>
<br>Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their&nbsp;<a NAME="1214"></a>own
proper excellence and have a defect instead?&nbsp;<a NAME="1215"></a>

<p>How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot&nbsp;<a NAME="1216"></a>see?&nbsp;<a NAME="1217"></a>
<br>You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, wh
ich is&nbsp;<a NAME="1218"></a>sight;
but I have not arrived at that point yet. I would rather ask the&nbsp;<a NAME="1219"></a>question
more generally, and only enquire whether the things which fulfil&nbsp;<a NAME="1220"></a>their
ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fall of fulfilling&nbsp;<a NAME="1221"></a>them
by their own defect?&nbsp;<a NAME="1222"></a>

<p>Certainly, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="1223"></a>
<br>I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper&amp;nbs
p;<a NAME="1224"></a>excellence
they cannot fulfil their end?&nbsp;<a NAME="1225"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="1226"></a>
<br>And the same observation will apply to all other&nbsp;<a NAME="1227"></a>things?&nbsp;<a NAME="1228"></a>
<br>I agree.&nbsp;<a NAME="1229"></a>
<br>Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for&nbsp;<a NAME="1230"></a>example,
to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. Are not&nbsp;<a NAME="1231"></a>these
functions proper to the soul, and 
can they rightly be assigned to&nbsp;<a NAME="1232"></a>any
other?&nbsp;<a NAME="1233"></a>

<p>To no other.&nbsp;<a NAME="1234"></a>
<br>And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the&nbsp;<a NAME="1235"></a>soul?&nbsp;<a NAME="1236"></a>
<br>Assuredly, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1237"></a>
<br>And has not the soul an excellence also?&nbsp;<a NAME="1238"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1239"></a>
<br>And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that&nbsp;<a NAME="1240"></a>excellen
ce?&nbsp;<a NAME="1241"></a>

<p>She cannot.&nbsp;<a NAME="1242"></a>
<br>Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent,&nbsp;<a NAME="1243"></a>and
the good soul a good ruler?&nbsp;<a NAME="1244"></a>

<p>Yes, necessarily.&nbsp;<a NAME="1245"></a>
<br>And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and&nbsp;<a NAME="1246"></a>injustice
the defect of the soul?&nbsp;<a NAME="1247"></a>

<p>That has been admitted.&nbsp;<a NAME="1248"></a>
<br>Then the just 
soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust&nbsp;<a NAME="1249"></a>man
will live ill?&nbsp;<a NAME="1250"></a>

<p>That is what your argument proves.&nbsp;<a NAME="1251"></a>
<br>And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the&nbsp;<a NAME="1252"></a>reverse
of happy?&nbsp;<a NAME="1253"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="1254"></a>
<br>Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?&nbsp;<a NAME="1255"></a>
<br>So be it.&nbsp;<a NAME="1256"></a>
<br>But happiness a
nd not misery is profitable.&nbsp;<a NAME="1257"></a>
<br>Of course.&nbsp;<a NAME="1258"></a>
<br>Then, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable&nbsp;<a NAME="1259"></a>than
justice.&nbsp;<a NAME="1260"></a>

<p>Let this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the&nbsp;<a NAME="1261"></a>Bendidea.&nbsp;<a NAME="1262"></a>
<br>For which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle&nbsp;<a NAME="1263"></a>towards
me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, I
 have not been well&nbsp;<a NAME="1264"></a>entertained;
but that was my own fault and not yours. As an epicure snatches&nbsp;<a NAME="1265"></a>a
taste of every dish which is successively brought to table, he not having&nbsp;<a NAME="1266"></a>allowed
himself time to enjoy the one before, so have I gone from one subject&nbsp;<a NAME="1267"></a>to
another without having discovered what I sought at first, the nature&nbsp;<a NAME="1268"></a>of
justice. I left that enquiry and turned away to consider whet
her justice&nbsp;<a NAME="1269"></a>is
virtue and wisdom or evil and folly; and when there arose a further&nbsp;<a NAME="1270"></a>question
about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice, I could&nbsp;<a NAME="1271"></a>not
refrain from passing on to that. And the result of the whole discussion&nbsp;<a NAME="1272"></a>has
been that I know nothing at all. For I know not what justice is, and&nbsp;<a NAME="1273"></a>therefore
I am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue, nor&nbsp;<a NAME="1274"></a>can
I say whether the just man is happy or unhappy.&nbsp;<a NAME="end"></a>
