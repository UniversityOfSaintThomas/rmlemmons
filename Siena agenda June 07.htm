argues that the fragmentation in our lives is

these forces interact dynamically to create
significant, if unnecessary problems for
women in professional life. Furthermore,
women academics are not the only ones in
this fragmentation, that it has dilatory effects
on our work, emotional and familial effects,
and spiritual effects. The solution requires
acknowledging the sacred nature of our
vocations as women and being guided by the
Church to a life of prayer and continual
discernment of God&#8217;s will for us. The Church
offers us essential tools to help us integrate more effectively our lives at work, at home and in

Sertillanges and Aquinas have much to
say on how anyone wishing to pursue the
life of the mind might do so in the midst
of the complexities of the active life. My
paper will consider the meaning of this
work for the professional woman seeking
to integrate the life of the intellect with
her vocation as woman and mother.
Especially important are Sertlillanges&#8217;s
arguments that the spiritual life plays an indispensable role in the pursuit of the true and the
good, that it is important to avoid being a dilettante and falling prey to an unbridled curiosity,
and that the &#8220;most valuable thing of all is will, a deeply rooted will.&#8221; In this session, we consider
several questions: can we admit that the fragmentation we experience is, at least in part,
attributable to a lack of will? If we grant that women are vital for reclaiming the culture of life,
what are the virtues that women pursuing an intellectual vocation need to acquire to fulfill their
destinies as women? How shall we live our lives so that we can fully occupy the place to which
God has called us?</span></span></p>

</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">In commenting on Blaise Pascal&#8217;s Pens&eacute;es, Thomas Morris emphasizes the importance of (a)
addressing ultimate philosophical and theological questions and (b) living an integrated life, a
life that integrates the intellectual, the spiritual, and the physical aspects of one&#8217;s experience.
Alfred Freddoso has also called attention to the importance of leading an integrated life. More
specifically, drawing on the Catholic
Intellectual Tradition, he argues that
in order to adequately and fully
address philosophical questions, one
must draw on theology, lead an
upright moral life, and cultivate a
rich spiritual life. Drawing on the
work of these philosophers, I have
reflected upon how one might
introduce students to questions about
the relationship between
philosophical inquiry and spiritual
practice. Some of these reflections
are contained within a recent paper
(that I distributed to the group), a paper in which I discuss ways of giving interested students
resources they could use in efforts to integrate their intellectual lives and their spiritual lives. In
addition to this paper, I distributed helpful material from the works of Pascal, Morris, and
Freddoso. </span></span></p>

<br>
</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">The fragmentation of woman&#8217;s lives can only be overcome by two kinds of contemplation. First
and foremost, we need the contemplation of which the philosophers speak,  namely, the
contemplation of God, who alone makes sense of our lives. But since this type of contemplation
requires solitude, it is interrupted by the exigencies of active lives. For this reason, we also need
the contemplation of Christ of which Mother Teresa speaks, whereby we contemplate the Christ
in the face of those who are suffering. Mother Teresa thus identifies the way in which the
contemplative and the active life can be united in love of
Christ.  Saint Therese of Lisieux also assists us to
understand this active form of contemplative love insofar
as she argues that any act can be an act of love. This
gender contribution to the proper understanding of
eudaimonia, however indispensable for integrating the
lives of women, does not suffice to end all types of
fragmentation. For there are three types of fragmentation
due to whether fragmentation is caused by the absence of meaning, the presence of intense
personal suffering, or overwhelming tasks. The first two types of fragmentation can be healed
through lovingly contemplating God; the last type requires one to integrate daily reflections that
enable her to realize that her life has a certain extension in time that puts her into contact with
eudaimonic goods&#8212;not simultaneously but sequentially. These contemplative reflections enable
one to realize that it is possible to organize life so that it has a certain form whereby one comes
into contact with eudaimonic goods. This is to contemplate the prudential relationship between
one&#8217;s actions and eudaimonia; it is to practice&#8212;what I call&#8212;&#8220;prudential contemplation.&#8221; 
Prudential contemplation heals the fragmentation caused by overwhelming tasks by enabling one
to realize that there is a rhythm to life that allows one&#8217;s life to be real and meaningful as long as
over time one attains to eudaimonic goods, i.e., those goods which makes life meaningful,
namely, loving God and neighbor either through intellectual or practical activities.  </span></span></p>
