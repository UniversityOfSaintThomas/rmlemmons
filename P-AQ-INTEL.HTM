<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;<p><b>I.76.1: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS BOTH FORM AND INTELLECT? </b>&nbsp;
 </p>
 
<p><b><i>N.B. This question was very important during the Middle Ages because
if the human soul is not both form and intellect, a human being would either
lack an intellect or a body. If human beings lack an intellect, then they
would be merely mortal animals. &nbsp;In today's world, this question is
important for three reasons. First, if the intellect or the intellectual soul
is the form of the human body, then it would be impossible for the human body
to be alive apart from the animating presence of one's personal soul. If
this is the case, then it is relevant for various bio-ethical questions, e.g.
whether a person is still alive when his neocortex is destroyed. Secondly, 
if it is the intellectual soul that animates matter into the human body, then
dualism is mistaken. Thirdly, if Aquinas is successful in identifying the
intellect as being within the soul of each person and if he is successful
in identifying the human soul as the form activating matter into the human
body, then he proves both that human beings can be personally immortal and
that the transmigration of human souls into different bodies is impossible.
This proof begins in this article and is completed in articles I.76.2-3-4-5-8]</i></b>
</p>
 
<p><b><big>I answer that,</big> We must assert that the [human soul is both 
form and intellect]. . . . The reason is because nothing acts except so far 
as it is in act. . . . Now it is clear that [life is the first act of the 
body and that the soul is the source of life]. [Understanding is also an activity
of life; hence, it too originates in the soul. If the human soul is the source
of life and understanding, then the soul is both form and intellect. The
human intellectual soul is thus the form of the body].</b> </p>
 
<p><b>But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of the 
body, he must first explain how it is that this action of understanding is 
the action of this particular man; for each one is conscious that it is himself 
who understands. . . . [If] it is one and the same man who is conscious both 
that he understands, and that he senses, then his intellectual soul is the 
form of the body, because none can sense without a body.<br>
 </b></p>
 
<p><b>[Furthermore, if none can sense without a body, then one who understands 
and senses must have both intellect and body. &nbsp;If so, then the form that
enables one to understand is the form of the body.]</b> </p>
 
<p><b>Some, however, tried to maintain that the intellect is united to the 
body as its motor; and hence that the intellect and body form one thing so 
that the act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole. This is, however,
absurd for many reasons. . . . Thirdly, because the action of a motor is
never attributed to the thing moved, except as to an instrument;  as the
action of a carpenter to a saw. Therefore if [the intellect were the  "motor"
of a person's body, then the body would be merely the instrument of the intellect;
if so, then personal identity is either the intellect or the body but not
both]. <br>
 </b></p>
 
<p><b>Fourthly, because, although the action of a part be attributed to the 
whole, as the action of the eye is attributed to a man; yet it is never attributed 
to another part, except perhaps indirectly; for we do not say that the hand 
sees because the eye sees. Therefore if the intellect and Socrates are united 
[as motor to a boat] . . . , the action of the intellect cannot be attributed 
to Socrates. <br>
 </b></p>
 
<p><b>[So if the human soul were not both intellect and the form of the body, 
then either the intellect or the body would be instruments of Socrates; and, 
Socrates would be unable to understand or to sense. Hence, the human soul 
is both intellect and form.] <br>
 </b></p>
 
<p><b>There remains, therefore, no other explanation than that given by Aristotle---namely, 
that this particular man understands, because the intellectual principle is
his form. Thus from the very operation of the intellect it is made clear that
the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form.</b> </p>
 
<p><b>But we must observe that the nobler a form is, the more it rises above 
corporeal matter, the less it is merged in matter, and the more it excels 
matter by its power and its operation; hence we find that the form of a mixed 
body has another operation not caused by its elemental qualities. And the 
higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find that the power 
of the form excels the elementary matter; as the vegetative soul excels the 
form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excels the vegetative soul. Now 
the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms. Therefore it excels corporeal 
matter in its power by the fact that it has an operation and a power in which 
corporeal matter has no share whatever. This power is called the intellect.</b>

<p><b>I. 76.3: WHETHER BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN OTHER
 SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER?</b> </p>
 
<p><b><i>ARTICLE COMMENTARY: If Aquinas is correct in arguing that every
human being has only one soul, then it is impossible for "humanoid animals"
to exist (i.e. no human body can live without the animating presence of the 
intellectual soul). Death thus occurs when the soul ceases to animate matter 
into a living body. This means that when some one suffers "neocortical death" 
they are still alive even though the brain's destruction precludes thought. 
It thus becomes matter of ethics to decide how to treat such persons appropriately. 
See the following article for additional clarification.</i></b> <br>
 &nbsp; <br>
 <b><big>I answer that</big> . . . . If we suppose, however, that the soul 
is united to the body as its form, it is quite impossible for several essentially
 different souls to be in one body. This can be made clear by <i>three different
 reasons. </i>In the <i>first</i> place, an animal would not be absolutely
 one, in which there were several souls. For nothing is absolutely one except
 by one form, by which a thing has existence: because a thing has from the
 same source both existence and unity; and therefore things which are denominated
 by various forms are not absolutely one; as, for instance, "a white man."
 If, therefore, man were 'living' by one form, the vegetative soul, and 'animal' 
by another form, the sensitive soul, and "man" by another form, the intellectual 
soul, it would follow that [no person would be unified. If this were so, then
there would be nothing unifying the parts of a human being into a person. 
If so, it would be impossible for anyone to be conscious of his parts as parts.
Nor would there be any personal identity that unifies parts into a self.]
. . .&nbsp; Thus <i>Aristotle . . . </i>asks (De Anima i, 5), "what contains
them?"---that is, what makes them one? It cannot be said that they are united
by the one body; because . . . the soul contain[s] the body and make[s] it
one, [rather] than the reverse.</b>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly</i>, .... <i>Thirdly</i>, this is shown 
to be impossible by the fact that when one operation of the soul is intense 
it impedes another, which could never be the case unless the principle of 
action were essentially one.</b> <br>
 </p>
 
<p>&nbsp; <b>We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul, the 
intellectual soul, and the nutritive soul are numerically one soul. This can
easily be explained, if we consider the differences of species and forms. 
For we observe that the species and forms of things differ from one another, 
as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the animate are more
perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect than plants, and man
than brute animals; and in each of these genera there are various degrees. 
.... Thus, neither is <i>Socrates</i> a man by one soul, and animal by another; 
but by one and the same soul he is both animal and man.</b> <br>
 &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; </p>
 
<p><b>I.76.8: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IN EACH PART OF THE BODY?</b> </p>
 
<p><b><big>I answer that</big> [the soul is in each part of the body]. . .
A proof of which is, that <i>on the withdrawal of the soul, no part of the
body retains its proper action</i>; although that which retains its species,
 retains the action of the species. But act is in that which it actuates:
<i>therefore</i> the soul must be in the whole body, and in each part thereof.</b>
<br>
 &nbsp; <br>
 <b></b>&nbsp;<b></b> </p>
 
<p><b>I.76.5: WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS PROPERLY UNITED TO SUCH A BODY?</b>
</p>
 
<p><b><big>I answer that</big>, ... Now the intellectual soul, as we have 
seen above (Q55, A2) in the order of nature, holds the lowest place among 
intellectual substances; inasmuch as it is not naturally gifted with the knowledge
of truth, as the angels are; but has to gather knowledge from individual things
by way of the senses, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii). But nature never
fails in necessary things: therefore the intellectual soul had to be endowed
not only with the power of understanding, but also with the power of feeling.
Now the action of the senses is not performed without a corporeal instrument.
Therefore it behooved the intellectual soul to be united to a body fitted
to be a convenient organ of sense.</b> </p>
