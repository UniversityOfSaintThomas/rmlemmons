<p><b>I.84.1: WHETHER THE SOUL KNOWS BODIES [OR PLATONIC FORMS]</b> <br>
<b>THROUGH THE INTELLECT?</b> </p>
<p><i>ON THE CONTRARY</i>, Science is in the intellect. If, <b>therefore</b>, 
the intellect does not know bodies, <b>it follows that</b> there is no science
of bodies; and <b>thus</b> perishes natural science, which treats of mobile
bodies. </p>
<p><b>I answer that . . . . </b><i>Plato</i>, who, wishing to save the <i>certitude</i> 
of our knowledge of truth through the intellect, maintained that, besides 
these things corporeal, there [are immaterial universals], . . .&nbsp; separate
from matter and movement [in the World of Forms], by participation of which
each one of these singular and sensible things is said to be either a man,
or a horse, or the like. <b>Therefore</b> he said that sciences and definitions,
and whatever appertains to the act of the intellect, are not referred to
these sensible bodies, but to those beings immaterial and separate: so that
according to this the soul does not understand these corporeal things, but
the separate [form] thereof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now <b>this may be shown to be false for two reasons</b>. 
<i>First</i>, <b>because</b>, [if Plato were right, then] <b>since</b> those
[separate forms] are immaterial and immovable, knowledge of movement and
matter would be excluded from science (which knowledge is proper to natural
science), and likewise all demonstration through moving and material causes.
<i>Secondly</i>, <b>because</b> it seems ridiculous, when we seek for knowledge
of things which are to us manifest, to introduce [the World of Forms]&nbsp;
which . . . differ from them essentially: so [even if recollection were true
and] we have a knowledge of those separate substances, we [would not know
the singular, changing, sensible thing.] <b></b><br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.84.2: WHETHER ... KNOWLEDGE IS MATERIAL?</b> </p>
<p><b>I answer that</b>, ... knowledge cannot be material; . . .if it were 
necessary for the thing known to exist materially in the knower, there would
be no reason why things which have a material existence outside the soul
should be devoid of knowledge; why, <b>for</b> instance, if by fire the soul
knows fire, that fire also which is outside the soul should not have knowledge
of fire. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must conclude, <b>therefore</b>, that material things
known must needs exist in the knower, not materially, but immaterially. <b>The 
reason of this</b> is, <b>because</b> the act of knowledge extends to things 
outside the knower: <b>for</b> we know things even that are external to us.
Now [matter individuates so that it is] by matter that the form of a thing
is determined to some one thing. <b>Therefore</b> [to know another as other
requires some degree of immateriality]. Hence it is clear that knowledge
is in inverse ratio of materiality.<br>
</p>
<p> And <b>consequently</b> things that are not receptive of forms save materially,
have no power of knowledge whatever---such as plants, as the Philosopher
says (De Anima ii, 12). But the more immaterially a thing receives the form
of the thing known, the more perfect is its knowledge. <b>Therefore</b> the
intellect which abstracts the species not only from matter, but also from
the individuating conditions of matter, has more perfect knowledge than the
senses, which receive the form of the thing known, without matter indeed,
but subject to material conditions. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.84.3: WHETHER THE SOUL UNDERSTANDS ALL THINGS THROUGH <i>INNATE IDEAS</i>?</b> 
</p>
<p>OBJ 3: Further, no one can answer the truth except concerning what he knows.
But even a person untaught and devoid of acquired knowledge, answers the
truth to every question if put to him in orderly fashion, as we find related
in the <i>Meno</i> (xv seqq.) of <i>Plato</i>, concerning a certain individual. 
<b>Therefore</b> we have some knowledge of things even before we acquire
knowledge; which would not be the case unless we had <i>innate ideas</i>.
<b>Therefore</b> the soul understands corporeal things through <i>innate ideas</i>. 
</p>
<p><i>ON THE CONTRARY</i>, The Philosopher, speaking of the intellect, says
(De Anima iii, 4) that it is like "a tablet on which nothing is written." 
</p>
<p><b>I answer that</b>, . . .[innate ideas are unreasonable]. </p>
<p><i>First</i>, <b>because</b>, if [the soul understands through innate ideas,
then the soul has a natural knowledge of all things, [and] it seems impossible
for the soul so far to forget the existence of such knowledge as not to know
itself to be possessed thereof, . . .And especially unreasonable does this
seem if we suppose that it is natural to the soul to be united to the body,
as we have established above (Q76, A1): <b>for</b> it is unreasonable that
the natural operation of a thing be totally hindered by that which belongs
to it naturally. </p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, the falseness of this opinion [that the soul understands 
through innate ideas] is clearly proved from the fact that if a sense be wanting,
the knowledge of what is apprehended through that sense is wanting also:
<b>for</b> instance, a man who is born blind can have no knowledge of colors.
This would not be the case if the soul had innate images of all intelligible
things. We must <b>therefore</b> conclude that the soul does not know corporeal
things through <i>innate ideas</i>. </p>
<p>Reply OBJ 3: If questions be put in an orderly fashion they proceed from
universal self-evident principles to what is particular. Now by such a process
knowledge is produced in the mind of the learner. <b>Therefore</b> when he
answers the truth to a subsequent question, this is not <b>because</b> he
had knowledge previously, but <b>because</b> he <b>thus</b> learns for the
first time. <b>For</b> it matters not whether the teacher proceed from universal
principles to conclusions by questioning or by asserting; <b>for</b> in either
case the mind of the listener is assured of what follows by that which preceded. 
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.84.4: WHETHER THE [SOUL'S CONCEPTS] ARE DERIVED BY THE SOUL FROM CERTAIN
SEPARATE FORMS? [ whether human knowledge must originate with the senses?]</b> 
</p>
<p><i>ON THE CONTRARY</i>, If this were true we should not need the senses 
in order to understand. And this is proved to be false especially from the
fact that if a man be wanting in a sense, he cannot have any knowledge of
the sensibles corresponding to that sense. </p>
<p><b>I answer that</b>, . . .[if the soul did not learn from the senses], 
then no sufficient reason can be assigned for the soul being united to the
body, . . .<b>since</b> [its existence is not dependent upon the body].&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Neither is Avicenna correct in holding] that the senses are necessary
to the soul, <b>because</b> by them it is aroused to turn to [some divine
being] from which it receives the species. . . . [For if Avicenna were right,]<b>then
it [would] follow that</b> . . . the soul of an individual wanting in one
of the senses can turn to this [divinity and] ... receive the intelligible
species of which the corresponding sensible species are wanting. And <b>thus</b>
a man born blind could have knowledge of colors; which is clearly untrue.
We must <b>therefore</b> conclude that the [concepts] by which our soul understands,
are [derived from the senses]. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.84.7: WHETHER THE INTELLECT ALWAYS REQUIRES [SENSE IMAGES AND THE 
BRAIN] IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND?</b> </p>
<p><i>ON THE CONTRARY</i>, The Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 7) that "the
soul understands nothing without a sense image." </p>
<p><b>I answer that</b>, In the present state of life, . . . it is impossible 
for our intellect to understand anything actually, except by turning to the
sense images. <i>First</i> of all <b>because</b> the intellect, being a power
that does not make use of a corporeal organ, would in no way be hindered
in its act through the lesion of a corporeal organ, if for its act there
were not required the act of some power that does make use of a corporeal
organ. <br>
</p>
<p>Secondly, . . . when anyone tries to understand something, he forms certain
sense images to serve him by way of examples, in which as it were he examines
what he is desirous of understanding. <b>For this reason</b> it is that when
we wish to help someone to understand something, we lay examples before him,
from which he forms sense images for the purpose of understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now <b>the reason of this</b> is that ...the nature of a stone or any
material thing cannot be known completely and truly, except in as much as
it is known as existing in the individual. Now we apprehend the individual
through the senses and the imagination. And, <b>therefore</b>,<i> for the
intellect to understand actually its proper object, it must of necessity
turn to the sense images in order to perceive the universal nature existing
in the individual</i>. But if the proper object of our intellect were a separate
form; or if, as the Platonists say, the natures of sensible things subsisted
apart from the individual; there would be no need for the intellect to turn
to the sense images whenever it understands. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.85.1: WHETHER OUR INTELLECT UNDERSTANDS CORPOREAL AND MATERIAL THINGS
BY ABSTRACTION FROM SENSE IMAGES?</b> </p>
<p><b>I answer that</b>, As stated above (Q84, A7), the object of knowledge 
is proportionate to the power of knowledge. Now there are three grades of
the cognitive powers. <b>For</b> one cognitive power, namely, the sense, is
the act of a corporeal organ. And <b>therefore</b> the object of every sensitive
power is a form as existing in corporeal matter. <i>And <b>since</b> such
matter is the principle of individuality, <b>therefore</b> every power of
the sensitive part can only have knowledge of the individual.</i> There is
another grade of cognitive power which is neither the act of a corporeal organ,
nor in any way connected with corporeal matter; such is the angelic intellect,
the object of whose cognitive power is <b>therefore</b> a form existing apart
from matter: <b>for</b> although angels know material things, yet they do
not know them save in something immaterial, namely, either in themselves
or in God. But the human intellect holds a middle place: <b>for</b> it is
not the act of an organ; yet it is a power of the soul which is the form
the body, as is clear from what we have said above (Q76, A1). And <b>therefore</b>
it is proper to it to know a form existing individually in corporeal matter,
but not as existing in this individual matter. But to know what is in individual
matter, not as existing in such matter, is to abstract the form from individual
matter which is represented by the sense images. <b>Therefore</b> we must
needs say that our intellect understands material things by abstracting from
the sense images; and through material things <b>thus</b> considered we acquire
some knowledge of immaterial things. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>I.85.2: [WHETHER INTELLECTUAL KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO IDEAS?]</b> </p>
<p><i>ON THE CONTRARY</i>, The [idea] is to the intellect what the sensible 
image is to the sense. But the sensible image is not what is perceived, but
rather that by which sense perceives. <b>Therefore</b> the [idea] is not
<i>what</i> is actually understood, but that <i>by which</i> the intellect 
understands. </p>
<p><b>I answer that</b>, Some have asserted that our intellectual faculties 
know only the impression made on them; as, <b>for</b> example, that sense 
is cognizant only of the impression made on its own organ. According to this
theory, the intellect understands only its own impression, namely, the [idea]
which it has received, so that [the idea] is what is understood. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is, however, manifestly false <b>for</b> <i>two 
reasons. First</i>, <b>because</b> the things we understand are the objects 
of science; <b>therefore</b> if what we understand is merely the [idea] in
the soul, <b>it would follow</b> that every science would not be concerned 
with objects outside the soul, but only with the [idea] within the soul; <b>thus</b>,
according to the teaching of the Platonists all science is about ideas [existing
in the World of Forms], which they held to be actually understood [*Q84,
A1]. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Secondly,</i> it is untrue, <b>because</b> it would
lead to the opinion of the ancients who maintained that "whatever seems,
is true" [*Aristotle, Metaph. iii. 5], and that <b>consequently</b> contradictories
are true simultaneously. <b>For</b> if the faculty knows its own impression
only, it can judge of that only. Now a thing seems according to the impression
made on the cognitive faculty. <b>Consequently</b> the cognitive faculty
will always judge of its own impression as such; and so every judgment will
be true. . .. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Therefore</b> it must be said that the [idea] is
related to the intellect as that by which it understands <b>. . . So since</b>
the intellect reflects upon itself, by such reflection it understands both
its own act of intelligence, and the [idea] by which it understands. <b>Thus</b>
the [idea] is that which is understood secondarily; but that which is primarily
understood is the object, of which the [idea] is the likeness. <br>
