 sexual equality in the belief that men and women really are equal to each

vocation–including the man’s. For since the human vocation requires all to use 
whatever opportunities they can to fight injustice through a love understood as 
a providential and collaborative care, all are obligated to fight the oppression 
of women, since Original Sin makes the oppression of women is 
omnipresent.</SPAN></P>

 <SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;"><I></I>Sexual equality is not only required by 
this text, it is also required by the theology of imaging God. For 
<I>Genesis</I> 1:27 claims not only that men and women equally image God, but 
that they image Him as male and female. But in what way does heterosexuality 
image God?</SPAN></P>
<P style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">If  . . . we wish 
to draw also from the narrative of the Yahwist text the concept of “image of 
God,” we can then deduce that man became the “image and likeness” of God not 
only through his own humanity, but also through the communion of persons which 
man and woman form right from the beginning. The function of the image is to 
reflect the one who is the model, to reproduce its own prototype. Man becomes 
the image of God not so much in the moment of solitude as in the moment of 
communion. He is . . . essentially an image of the inscrutable divine communion 
of Persons.</SPAN> <A href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote3', WPFootnote3 )"><IMG

<P style="line-height: 0.416in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">Accordingly, 
heterosexual love and spousal oneness image nothing less than the love and
 oneness of the Trinity, wherein the distinction of persons—and roles---preclude 
neither unity nor equality. The spousal unification in love excels in imaging 
the triune God in the following ways: (1) by being a unit constituted by love; 
(2) by being fertile in the generation of new life; and (3) by being a unit of 
<I>distinct </I> equals.</SPAN> <A href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote4', WPFootnote4 )"><IMG

<P style="line-height: 0.416in;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 12pt;"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>Hence, 
the human vocation to love in the image of the Trinity bestows upon femininity 
and masculinity their proper meanings: self-transcendence through a fruitful
 love between distinct equals. Sexuality is for facilitating a fruitful 
Trinitarian-like love. As a result, any inequality would thus distort this 
sacred Trinitarian image. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P style="line-height: 0.416in;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 12pt;"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>On 
the other hand, it has been argued---on the basis of Scripture---that marriage
 institutionalizes sexual inequality. In this regard, two passages are cited 
most frequently:<I>Genesis</I> 2:18-25 in which God declares that Adam will 
receive a helper fit for him; and <I>Eph.</I> 5:22-23 in which wives are told to 
be submissive to their husbands.  Being a helper and being submissive can be 
understood either as a gender role peculiar to wives or as a spousal role common 
to both men and women. The first interpretation establishes an inequality that 
contradicts the equality required by <I>Genesis</I> 1:27. It also misunderstands
 the story of Adam and Eve. According to John Paul II, the <I>Genesis</I> text 
that brings woman forth from Adam’s rib confirms her equality.</SPAN> <A href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote6', WPFootnote6 )"><IMG

 <SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">  Taking these texts as his guide, John Paul II

 submissive are to be understood as identifying spousal roles, rather than 
gender roles. As such, these texts require not only the man to be the wife’s 
helper,</SPAN> <A href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote7', WPFootnote7 )"><IMG

 <SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;"> In the words of John Paul II: </SPAN></P>
<P style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">The author of the 
Letter to the Ephesians . . . ‘Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the 
Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife’ (5:22-23) . . . knows that this 
way of speaking, so profoundly rooted in the customs and religious tradition of 
the time, is to be understood and carried out in a new way: as a “<I>mutual
 subjection out of reverence for Christ”</I> (cf. Eph. 5:21). . . . in the 
relationship between husband and wife the ‘subjection’ is not one-sided but 
mutual.  </SPAN></P>
<P style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">In relation to the 
‘old’ this is evidently something ‘new’: it is an innovation of the Gospel.

<P style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">All of the reasons

women. <I>Genesis</I> 3:16 is quite explicit that some penalties of Original Sin 
are gender-specific, affecting even the spousal union of love:  “Your desire 
shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.”  In other words, 
Original Sin left woman with the desire to close her love in upon her husband 
and make him the lord, while Original Sin left men with the desire to dominate 
women. Yielding to either desire is the wellspring of sexual inequality and 
oppression. </SPAN></P>

gender ramifications of Original Sin have yet to be fully recognized. The 
<I>Genesis</I> punishments, writes John Paul II,  “refer directly to marriage,

being a woman.”</SPAN> <A href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote10', WPFootnote10 )"><IMG

<P style="line-height: 0.416in;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 12pt;"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>Male 
domination has been responsible for much suffering on the part of woman valued 
as existing only for the sake of man—and not for her own sake. This is
 particularly the case since lust gives male domination its particular color. A 
man’s lust confirms his dominating tendency and prevents the woman from being 
seen as man’s equal; she is, for the man, an object of sexual gratification. As 
a result, lust and its presuppositions of inequality are especially destructive 
of spousal love which requires each spouse to be a gift of love for the other. 
Lust and inequality block the ability of the husband to recognize the wife’s 
acts of love as gifts; rather, such husbands treat any act of love as 
acknowledgment of his superiority. In such relationships, there is nothing the
 woman can do that can be recognized as a spousal love-gift; her initiatives are
 misunderstood as attempts to gain power over the man; they are not perceived 
as<I> inviting</I> <I>an equal</I> to a union of love. As a writer to Ann 
Landers complained:</SPAN> <A href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote11', WPFootnote11 )"><IMG

<P style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">The truth is, 
there is not a woman on the planet who can fully satisfy the needs of a powerful 
male. When women quit asking men to make them the center of their universe and 
learn to accept a strong man’s desire for more than one female companion, 
families will live together longer, more happily and with less 
rancor.</SPAN></P><BR>
<P style="line-height: 0.416in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">The prejudice, 
shown in this letter, shows how blinding male chauvinism can be. For this
 reason, chauvinism is not merely selfishness but a destroyer of interpersonal 
love between equals. As the Pope points out: </SPAN></P>
<P style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">. . . “domination” 
indicates the disturbance and loss of the stability of that fundamental equality 
which the man and the woman possess in the “unity of the two” and this is 
especially to the disadvantage of the woman, whereas <I>only the equality 
</I>resulting from their dignity as persons can give to their mutual
 relationship the character of an <I>authentic</I> “communio personarum.”  
<I>Mulieris Dignitatem</I>  n. 10 (emphasis mine)</SPAN></P><BR>
<P style="line-height: 0.416in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">Equality, thus, 
for John Paul II, is a necessary presupposition to marital love.  Unless a man 
<I>first</I> affirms that a woman is his equal, her love can neither be 
recognized as a gift nor reciprocated; without reciprocation, an “authentic” 
spousal communion cannot be established. In other words, the man’s affirmation 
of a woman’s equality necessarily precedes her ability to be a gift of love to 
the man as well as the man’s ability to be a gift of love to the woman.

John Paul II—in order to protect the conditions necessary for spousal
 love—denounces sexual inequality----and encourages all to resist the on-going

that interpersonal relations are not folder for egotistical power games but for 
altruistic love. Altruistic love transcends the self; it, thereby, frees the

<P style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">When we base 
ourselves on this disquieting model [of Christ crucified], we are able with all 
humility to show mercy to others, knowing that Christ accepts it as if it were 
shown to himself (Mt 25:43-40). An act of merciful love is only really such when 
we are deeply convinced at the moment that we perform it that we are at the same 
time receiving mercy from the people who are accepting it from us. (<I>DM</I> 
14.30).</SPAN></P>
<P style="line-height: 0.416in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">The awareness of 
mercy’s mutuality precludes prideful self-righteousness and arrogance by 
reinforcing the sacredness of the other that is so necessary for recognizing the

style="font-size: 12pt;"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>The 
mutuality of merciful love is experienced through collaboration. As a result,
 the obligation to counter the effects of Original Sin makes collaboration a 
universal duty. As John Paul II points out:</SPAN></P>
<P style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt;">Collaboration in 
the development of the whole person and of every human being is in fact <SPAN 
style="font-weight: bold;">a duty of all toward all</SPAN> . . .  If, on the 
contrary, people try to achieve it in only one part, or in only one world, they 
do so at the expense of the others; and , precisely because the others are 
ignored, their own development becomes exaggerated and misdirected.

interdependent race: the confined heart is deformed and enslaved by selfish
 desires. Self-development and flourishing requires being other-centered. 
Other-centeredness caring about the other’s perspective and needs; it requires 
listening to the other; it thus requires collaboration. Collaboration expresses 
a caring, providential love. Collaborative and providential love is the means 
for achieving the common good.  Such love humanizes the world.</SPAN> <A href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote17', WPFootnote17 )"><IMG

obligation to humanize the world requires a commitment not only to end the
 oppression of all, but also the obligation to end the oppression of women. As 
such, it is the obligation to be a feminist. The obligation to end the 
oppression of women---through merciful love and collaboration—honors maternal 
relationships. It finds the killing of her offspring, whether born or unborn, 
morally reprehensible and demeaning. Feminism must be pro-life in order to be 
truly supportive of women’s reality and her vocation to self-transcendent love. 
Pro-life feminism, moreover, requires human reproduction to occur through 
heterosexual love unions, since cloning or asexual reproduction is inseparable
 from the destruction of embryonic human life.  Pro-life feminism thus requires 
all to be a complementarian or personalist feminist. </SPAN></P>
<P style="line-height: 0.416in;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 12pt;"><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>In 
other words, personalist feminism argues that heterosexual reproduction of the
 human race, not only identifies complementarity as essential to sexuality, but 
also identifies the continuation of the race with self-transcendence through 
union with others. But since there is no self-transcendence without love, 
personalist feminism argues that the human destiny is achieved through love. 
Thus, personalist feminism holds that self-transcendence through love should 
characterize all human interactions–even those at work.  Self-transcendence at 
work is achieved when providential and collaborative work aims at advancing the 
common good. Thus, heterosexual complementarity marks each of us as designed by 
the Creator for love at all times and places.</SPAN> <A href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote18', WPFootnote18 )"><IMG

professionals build economic, educational, medical, political, legal, and other

 promote their happiness, they are not likely to do so. We are a fallen race. 
Careful review of our institutions are thus needed to ensure that they do not

transcendent truth, in obedience to which a person achieves his full identity, 
then there is no sure principle for guaranteeing just relations between people. 
Their self-interest as a class, group or nation would inevitably set them in
 opposition to one another. If one does not acknowledge transcendent truth, then
 the force of power takes over, and each person tends to make full use of the 
means at his disposal in order to impose his own interests or his own opinion, 
with no regard for the rights of others. People are then respected only to the
