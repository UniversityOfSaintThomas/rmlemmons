ÁÁ”Rediscovering Eudaimonistic Teleology•, R. Mary Hayden.
This paper undertakes three tasks: (1) to argue that the loss ofeudaimonistic ethics©©©especially as formulated by Aristotle andAquinas©©©to mainstream ethical discourse is not properly due toany Humean or Kantian revelations of inadequacies inherent in itsteleological structure; (2) to argue that ethical dilemmas areresolvable by eudaimonistic teleology; and, (3) to argue thateudaimonistic teleology has the capacity to restore unity to thediaspora of contemporary ethics©©©once it is rediscovered.
