"Natural Inclinations and Moral Absolutes: A MediatedCorrespondence for Aquinas," Mary Hayden

The traditional ways in which natural inclinations serve as thebasis for moral absolutes fail to fully capture the nuances ofAquinas' natural law. Mistaken explications include "TheCorrespondence Theory" which simply posits that every naturalinclination immediately generates a moral absolute and "CognitiveVoluntarism" which holds that the goods prescribed by moralabsolutes are obligatory only because they are desired©©©albeitnaturally. After these positions are shown to be inadequate, Iexplicate through the fact of nonapplicability the proper ways inwhich natural inclinations support moral absolutes.
