”Rediscovering Eudaimonistic Teleology•, R. Mary Hayden. Due toHumean and Kantian criticisms eudaimonistic ethics©©©especiallyas formulated by Aristotle and Aquinas©©©has been lost tomainstream ethical discourse which in turn has lost its coherenceand its ability to resolve ethical dilemmas. This paper arguesthat not only does eudaimonistic ethics escape unscathed Humeanand Kantian charges but that its capacity, for example, toresolve ethical dilemmas shows that it can restore unity to thediaspora of contemporary ethics.
