L 214: INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS
<br>FALL 2003
<br>Dr. Lemmons

<br>&nbsp;
<br>Ethics is the philosophical study of morality. It seeks not only to
identify basic principles, norms, values and virtues, but also to evaluate
<br>systematically the morality of acts as well as the veracity of various
systems. It does so by focusing on arguments as the way to truth. No
<br>error is so complete as to be without insight just as no human perspective
is so perfect as to leave no room for growth. This course, while
<br>seeking to understand morality within and across cultures – emphasizes
the insights of Aquinas into the personal and public morality of
<br>natural law.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10% Attentive
and Responsive Class Attendance
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15% Rolling
Reading Analyses. The six steps of analysis are 1) identifying the reading’s
main point; 2) identifying the key
<br>reasons why the author asserts the main point; 3) identifying the key
objections to the main point that are in the text or that need to be
<br>addressed; 4) identifying how the author meets those objections or
how the logic of the author’s position would meet those objections; 5)
<br>evaluating whether the author’s argument or the objections are stronger;
and 6) constructing an argument proving your evaluation. Every
<br>student ought to complete the requisite steps for each assignment,
but will be responsible for handing in their analyses only when
<br>assigned – approximately once every three weeks.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25% Web
discussion. There are three main objectives for the web discussion. The
first is to provide a student focused forum that
<br>allows the further exploration of issues covered in class as well as
to explore issues not covered in class. The second is to facilitate
<br>developing the philosophical attitude as well as the skills of analysis
and persuasion. The third is to facilitate the development of tact while
<br>discussing controversial issues with those who disagree. In this regard,
we will use disagreements to see if our reasoning commits any
<br>fallacies, such as, hasty generalization, overlooking alternatives,
begging the question. At all times, we will avoid disrespectful language,
<br>loaded arguments, and ad hominem attacks. And, we will remember that
sincere disagreement on the basis of pertinent reasons is a form
<br>of deep respect.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To earn
a C grade for your postings, you need to meet the minimal requirement of
posting a weekly comment. Those posting more
<br>frequently – with questions that evoke discussions and with comments
that use course materials with insightful and tactful arguments –
<br>earn higher grades.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Postings
are graded at the end of every month. Grading requires submitting a portfolio
of your messages for that month. The easy
<br>way to make this portfolio is to simply print your comments as you
post them. If you post a discussion question, which promotes much
<br>discussion, print the web page showing the resulting links to your
message.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25% Midterm
paper. Approximately 6-8 typed pages. Due Monday, October 20th. Analysis
of the Ethical Adequacy of Darrell
<br>Scott”s Chain Reaction: A Call to Compassionate Revolution. (Required
Text). This assignment requires using class materials to argue
<br>about whether Rachel’s ethics – as interpreted by her father – is adequate
or whether it needs to be modified for the 21st century. An
<br>argument outline is required.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25% Final
Paper. (approximately 6-8 typed pages). Due Friday, Dec. 19th. Choose one
of the following two topics. TOPIC ONE:
<br>Requisite Social Norms and Principles. This topic requires arguing
that a moral society requires a particular ethics. Your argument must
<br>respond to objections. An argument outline is required. TOPIC TWO:
Issue Analysis and Policy Recommendation. This topic requires
<br>undertaking a normative analysis of some societal evil that (a) examines
the moral values at stake and identifies the historical origins of
<br>the evil; (b) argues that despite the prevalence of this evil practice
and arguments in its favor, it ought to end; (c) formulates a
<br>recommendation for removing the evil from society (this argument need
not involve legislation); and (d) argues that this recommendation
<br>ought to be followed. An argument outline is to be attached to the
paper.
