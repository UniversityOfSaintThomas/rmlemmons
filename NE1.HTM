<p><b>BOOK I</b>

<p>&nbsp;1 <b>Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and
choice, is thought to aim at some good</b>; and for this reason the good
has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim. But a certain
difference is found among ends; some are activities, others are products
apart from the activities that produce them. Where there are ends apart
from the actions, it is the nature of the products to be better than the
activities. Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding
a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics wealth. But where
such arts fall under a single capacity--as bridle-making and the other
arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding,
and this and every military action under strategy, in the same way other
arts fall under yet others--in all of these the ends of the master arts
are to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is for the sake
of the former that the latter are pursued. It makes no difference whether
the activities themselves are the ends of the actions, or something else
apart from the activities, as in the case of the sciences just mentioned.

<p>&nbsp;2 If, then, there is some end of the things we do, which we desire
for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this),
and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for
at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would
be empty and vain), clearly <b>this must be the good and the chief good.
Will not the knowledge of it, then, have a great influence on life?</b>
Shall we not, like archers who have a mark to aim at, be more likely to
hit upon what we should? If so, we must try, in outline at least, to determine
what it is, and of which of the sciences or capacities it is the object.
It would seem to belong to the most authoritative art and that which is
most truly the master art. And politics appears to be of this nature; for
it is this that ordains which of the sciences should be studied in a state,
and which each class of citizens should learn and up to what point they
should learn them; and we see even the most highly esteemed of capacities
to fall under this, e.g. strategy, economics, rhetoric; now, since politics
uses the rest of the sciences, and since, again, it legislates as to what
we are to do and what we are to abstain from, the end of this science must
include those of the others, so that this end must be the good for man.
For even if the end is the same for a single man and for a state, that
of the state seems at all events something greater and more complete both
to attain and to preserve; for though it is worth while to attain the end
merely for one man, it is finer and more godlike to attain it for a nation
or for city-states. These, then, are the ends at which our inquiry, being
concerned with politics, aims.

<p>&nbsp;Our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as
the subject-matter admits of; for precision is not to be sought for alike
in all discussions, any more than in all the products of the crafts. Now
fine and just actions, which political science investigates, exhibit much
variety and fluctuation, so that they may be thought to exist only by convention,
and not by nature. And goods also exhibit a similar fluctuation because
they bring harm to many people; for before now men have been undone by
reason of their wealth, and others by reason of their courage. We must
be content, then, in speaking of such subjects and with such premisses
to indicate the truth roughly and in outline, and in speaking about things
which are only for the most part true and with premisses of the same kind
to reach conclusions that are no better. In the same spirit, therefore,
should each of our statements be received; for it is the mark of an educated
man to look for precision in each class of things just so far as the nature
of the subject admits: it is evidently equally foolish to accept probable
reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician demonstrative
proofs.

<p><b>&nbsp;Now each man judges well the things he knows, and of these
he is a good judge</b>. And so the man who has been educated in a subject
is a good judge of that subject, and the man who has received an all-round
education is a good judge in general. Hence a young man is not a proper
hearer of lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the
actions that occur in life, but its discussions start from these and are
about these; and, further, since he tends to follow his passions, his study
will be vain and unprofitable, because the end aimed at is not knowledge
but action. And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or
youthful in character; the defect does not depend on time, but on his living
and pursuing each successive object as passion directs. For to such persons,
as to the incontinent, knowledge brings no profit; but to those who desire
and act in accordance with a rational principle knowledge about such matters
will be of great benefit.

<p>&nbsp;These remarks about the student, the way in which our statements
should be received, and the purpose of the inquiry, may be taken as our
preface.

<p>&nbsp;Let us resume our inquiry and state, in view of the fact that
all knowledge and choice aims at some good, what it is that we say political
science aims at and what is the highest of all goods achievable by action.
Verbally there is very general agreement; for both the general run of men
and people of superior refinement say that<i> it is happiness, and identify
living well and faring well with being happy; but with regard to what happiness
is they differ,</i> and the many do not give the same account as the wise.
For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing, like pleasure,
wealth, or honour; they differ, however, from one another--and often even
the same man identifies it with different things, with health when he is
ill, with wealth when he is poor; but, conscious of their ignorance, they
admire those who proclaim some great thing that is above their comprehension.
Now some thought that apart from these many goods there is another which
is good in itself and causes the goodness of all these as well. To examine
all the opinions that have been held would no doubt be somewhat fruitless:
it is enough to examine those that are most prevalent or that seem to have
some reason in their favour.

<p>&nbsp;Let us not fail to notice, however, that there is a difference
between arguments from and those to the first principles. For <b>Plato,</b>
too, was right in raising this question and asking, as he used to do, 'are
we on the way from or to the first principles?' There is a difference,
as there is in a race-course between the course from the judges to the
turning-point and the way back. For, while we must begin with what is familiar,
things are so in two ways--some to us, some without qualification. Presumably,
then, we must begin with things familiar to us. Hence any one who is to
listen intelligently to lectures about what is noble and just and, generally,
about the subjects of political science must have been brought up in good
habits. For the facts are the starting-point, and if they are sufficiently
plain to him, he will not need the reason as well; and the man who has
been well brought up has or can easily get starting-points. And as for
him who neither has nor can get them, let him hear the words of Hesiod:^1

<p>&nbsp;Far best is he who knows all things himself;
<br>&nbsp;Good, he that hearkens when men counsel right;
<br>&nbsp;But he who neither knows, nor lays to heart
<br>&nbsp;Another's wisdom, is a useless wight.

<p>&nbsp;5&nbsp; Let us, however, resume our discussion from the point
at which we digressed. To judge from the lives that men lead, most men,
and men of the most vulgar type, seem (not without some reason) to identify
the good, or happiness, with pleasure; which is the reason why they love
the life of enjoyment. For there are, we may say, <b>three prominent types
of life</b>--that just mentioned, the political, and thirdly the contemplative
life. Now the mass of mankind are evidently quite slavish in their tastes,
preferring a life suitable to beasts, but they get some reason for their
view from the fact that many of those in high places share the tastes of
Sardanapallus. But people of superior refinement and of active disposition
identify happiness with honour; for this is, roughly speaking, the end
of the political life. But it seems too superficial to be what we are looking
for, since it is thought to depend on those who bestow honour rather than
on him who receives it, but the good we divine to be something of one's
own and not easily taken from one. Further, men seem to pursue honour in
order that they may be assured of their merit; at least it is by men of
practical wisdom that they seek to be honoured, and among those who know
them, and on the ground of their excellence; clearly, then, according to
them, at any rate, excellence is better. And perhaps one might even suppose
this to be, rather than honour, the end of the political life. But even
this appears somewhat incomplete; for possession of excellence seems actually
compatible with being asleep, or with lifelong inactivity, and, further,
with the greatest sufferings and misfortunes; but a man who was living
so no one would call happy, unless he were maintaining a thesis at all
costs. But enough of this; for the subject has been sufficiently treated
even in ordinary discussions. Third comes <b>the contemplative life</b>,
which we shall consider later.

<p>&nbsp;The<b> life of money-making is one undertaken under compulsion,
and wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful
and for the sake of something else</b>. And so one might rather take the
aforenamed objects to be ends; for they are loved for themselves. But it
is evident that not even these are ends--although many arguments have been
thrown away in support of them. Let us then dismiss them.

<p>&nbsp;6 We had perhaps better consider the universal good and discuss
thoroughly what is meant by it, although such an inquiry is made an uphill
one by the fact that the Forms have been introduced by friends of our own.
Yet it would perhaps be thought to be better, indeed to be our duty, for
the sake of maintaining the truth even to destroy what touches us closely,
especially as we are philosophers; for, while both are dear, piety requires
us to honour truth above our friends.

<p>[text omitted]

<p>&nbsp;7 Let us again return to the good we are seeking, and ask what
it can be. It seems different in different actions and arts; it is different
in medicine, in strategy, and in the other arts likewise. What then is
the good of each? Surely that for whose sake everything else is done. In
medicine this is health, in strategy victory, in architecture a house,
in any other sphere something else, and in every action and choice the
end; for it is for the sake of this that all men do whatever else they
do. Therefore, if there is an end for all that we do, this will be the
good achievable by action, and if there are more than one, these will be
the goods achievable by action.

<p>&nbsp;So the argument has by a different course reached the same point;
but we must try to state this even more clearly. Since there are evidently
more than one end, and we choose some of these (e.g. wealth, flutes, and
in general instruments) for the sake of something else, clearly not all
ends are complete ends; <b>but the chief good is evidently something complete.</b>
Therefore, if there is only one complete end, this will be what we are
seeking, and if there are more than one, the most complete of these will
be what we are seeking. Now we call that which is in itself worthy of pursuit
more complete than that which is worthy of pursuit for the sake of something
else, and that which is never desirable for the sake of something else
more complete than the things that are desirable both in themselves and
for the sake of that other thing, and <i>therefore we call complete without
qualification that which is always desirable in itself and never for the
sake of something else.</i>

<p>&nbsp;Now such a thing happiness, above all else, is held to be; for
this we choose always for itself and never for the sake of something else,
but honour, pleasure, reason, and every excellence we choose indeed for
themselves (for if nothing resulted from them we should still choose each
of them), but we choose them also for the sake of happiness, judging that
through them we shall be happy. <b>Happiness, on the other hand, no one
chooses for the sake of these, nor, in general, for anything other than
itself.</b>

<p>&nbsp;From the point of view of <b>self-sufficiency</b> the same result
seems to follow; for the complete good is thought to be self-sufficient.
Now by self-sufficient we do not mean that which is sufficient for a man
by himself, for one who lives a solitary life, but also for parents, children,
wife, and in general for his friends and fellow citizens, since man is
sociable by nature. But some limit must be set to this; for if we extend
our requirement to ancestors and descendants and friends' friends we are
in for an infinite series. Let us examine this question, however, on another
occasion; the s<i>elf-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated
makes life desirable and lacking in nothing;</i> and such we think happiness
to be; and further we think it most desirable of all things, without being
counted as one good thing among others--if it were so counted it would
clearly be made more desirable by the addition of even the least of goods;
for that which is added becomes an excess of goods, and of goods the greater
is always more desirable.<b> Happiness, then, is something complete and
self-sufficient, and is the end of action.</b>

<p>&nbsp;<b>Presumably, however, to say that happiness is the chief good
seems a platitude, and a clearer account of what it is is still desired.
This might perhaps be given, if we could first ascertain the function of
man.</b> For just as for a flute-player, a sculptor, or any artist, and,
in general, for all things that have a function or activity, the good and
the 'well' is thought to reside in the function, so would it seem to be
for man, if he has a function. Have the carpenter, then, and the tanner
certain functions or activities, and has man none? Is he naturally functionless?
Or as eye, hand, foot, and in general each of the parts evidently has a
function, may one lay it down that man similarly has a function apart from
all these? What then can this be? Life seems to be common even to plants,
but we are seeking what is peculiar to man. Let us exclude, therefore,
the life of nutrition and growth. Next there would be a life of perception,
but it also seems to be common even to the horse, the ox, and every animal.
There remains, then, an active life of the element that has a rational
principle (of this, one part has such a principle in the sense of being
obedient to one, the other in the sense of possessing one and exercising
thought); and as this too can be taken in two ways, we must state that
life in the sense of activity is what we mean; for this seems to be the
more proper sense of the term. Now if the function of man is an activity
of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational principle, and if
we say a so-and-so and a good so-and-so have a function which is the same
in kind, e.g. a lyre-player and a good lyre-player, and so without qualification
in all cases, eminence in respect of excellence being added to the function
(for the function of a lyre-player is to play the lyre, and that of a good
lyre-player is to do so well): if this is the case, [and we state the function
of man to be a certain kind of life, and this to be an activity or actions
of the soul implying a rational principle, and the function of a good man
to be the good and noble performance of these, and if any action is well
performed when it is performed in accordance with the appropriate excellence:
if this is the case,]^2<b> human good turns out to be activity of soul
in conformity with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence,
in conformity with the best and most complete.</b>

<p>&nbsp;But <b>we must add 'in a complete life'.</b> For one swallow does
not make a summer, nor does one day; and so too one day, or a short time,
does not make a man blessed and happy.

<p>&nbsp;Let this serve as an outline of the good; for we must presumably
first sketch it roughly, and then later fill in the details. But it would
seem that any one is capable of carrying on and articulating what has once
been well outlined, and that time is a good discoverer or partner in such
a work; to which facts the advances of the arts are due; for any one can
add what is lacking. And we must also remember what has been said before,
and not look for precision in all things alike, but in each class of things
such precision as accords with the subject-matter, and so much as is appropriate
to the inquiry. For a carpenter and a geometer look for right angles in
different ways; the former does so in so far as the right angle is useful
for his work, while the latter inquires what it is or what sort of thing
it is; for he is a spectator of the truth. We must act in the same way,
then, in all other matters as well, that our main task may not be subordinated
to minor questions. Nor must we demand the cause in all matters alike;
it is enough in some cases that the fact be well established, as in the
case of the first principles; the fact is a primary thing or first principle.
Now of first principles we see some by induction, some by perception, some
by a certain habituation, and others too in other ways. But each set of
principles we must try to investigate in the natural way, and we must take
pains to determine them correctly, since they have a great influence on
what follows. For the beginning is thought to be more than half of the
whole, and many of the questions we ask are cleared up by it.

<p>&nbsp;8 ú <b>We must consider it, however, in the light not only
of our conclusion and our premisses, but also of what is commonly said
about it; for with a true view all the facts harmonize, but with a false
one they soon clash</b>. Now goods have been divided into three classes,
and some are described as external, others as relating to soul or to body;
and we call those that relate to soul most properly and truly goods. But
we are positing actions and activities relating to soul. Therefore our
account must be sound, at least according to this view, which is an old
one and agreed on by philosophers. It is correct also in that we identify
the end with certain actions and activities; for thus it falls among goods
of the soul and not among external goods. Another belief which harmonizes
with our account is that the happy man lives well and fares well; for we
have practically defined happiness as a sort of living and faring well.
The characteristics that are looked for in happiness seem also, all of
excellence, some with practical wisdom, others with a kind of philosophic
wisdom, others with these, or one of these, accompanied by pleasure or
not without pleasure; while others include also external prosperity. Now
some of these views have been held by many men and men of old, others by
a few persons; and it is not probable that either of these should be entirely
mistaken, but rather that they should be right in at least some one respect
or even in most respects.

<p>&nbsp;With those who identify happiness with excellence or some one
excellence our account is in harmony; for to excellence belongs activity
in accordance with excellence. But it makes, perhaps, no small difference
whether we place the chief good in possession or in use, in state or in
activity. For the state may exist without producing any good result, as
in a man who is asleep or in some other way quite inactive, but the activity
cannot; for one who has the activity will of necessity be acting, and acting
well. And as in the Olympic Games it is not the most beautiful and the
strongest that are crowned but those who compete (for it is some of these
that are victorious), so those who act rightly win the noble and good things
in life.

<p>&nbsp;Their life is also in itself pleasant. For pleasure is a state
of soul, and to each man that which he is said to be a lover of is pleasant;
e.g. not only is a horse pleasant to the lover of horses, and a spectacle
to the lover of sights, but also in the same way just acts are pleasant
to the lover of justice and in general excellent acts to the lover of excellence.
Now for most men their pleasures are in conflict with one another because
these are not by nature pleasant, but the lovers of what is noble find
pleasant the things that are by nature pleasant; and excellent actions
are such, so that these are pleasant for such men as well as in their own
nature. Their life, therefore, has no further need of pleasure as a sort
of adventitious charm, but has its pleasure in itself. For, besides what
we have said, the man who does not rejoice in noble actions is not even
good; since no one would call a man just who did not enjoy acting justly,
nor any man liberal who did not enjoy liberal actions; and similarly in
all other cases. If this is so, excellent actions must be in themselves
pleasant. But they are also good and noble, and have each of these attributes
in the highest degree, since the good man judges well about these attributes
and he judges in the way we have described. Happiness then is the best,
noblest, and most pleasant thing, and these attributes are not severed
as in the inscription at Delos--

<p>&nbsp;Most noble is that which is justest, and best is health;
<br>&nbsp;But pleasantest is it to win what we love.

<p>For all these properties belong to the best activities; and these, or
one--the best--of these, we identify with happiness.

<p>&nbsp;Yet evidently, as we said,<b> it needs the external goods as well</b>;
for it is impossible, or not easy, to do noble acts without the proper
equipment. In many actions we use friends and riches and political power
as instruments; and there are some things the lack of which takes the lustre
from blessedness, as good birth, satisfactory children, beauty; for the
man who is very ugly in appearance or ill-born or solitary and childless
is hardly happy, and perhaps a man would be still less so if he had thoroughly
bad children or friends or had lost good children or friends by death.
As we said, then, happiness seems to need this sort of prosperity in addition;
for which reason some identify happiness with good fortune, though others
identify it with excellence.

<p>&nbsp;9 ú For this reason also the question is asked, whether
happiness is to be acquired by learning or by habituation or some other
sort of training, or comes in virtue of some divine providence or again
by chance. Now if there is any gift of the gods to men, it is reasonable
that happiness should be god-given, and most surely god-given of all human
things inasmuch as it is the best. But this question would perhaps be more
appropriate to another inquiry; happiness seems, however, even if it is
not god-sent but comes as a result of excellence and some process of learning
or training, to be among the most godlike things; for that which is the
prize and end of excellence seems to be the best thing and something godlike
and blessed.

<p>&nbsp;It will also on this view be very generally shared; for all who
are not maimed as regards excellence may win it by a certain kind of study
and care. But if it is better to be happy thus than by chance, it is reasonable
that the facts should be so, since everything that depends on the action
of nature is by nature as good as it can be, and similarly everything that
depends on art or any cause, and especially if it depends on the best of
all causes. <i>To entrust to chance what is greatest and most noble would
be a very defective arrangement.</i>

<p>&nbsp;The answer to the question we are asking is plain also from the
definition; for it has been said to be a certain kind of activity of soul.
Of the remaining goods, some are necessary and others are naturally co-operative
and useful as instruments. And this will be found to agree with what we
said at the outset; for we stated the end of political science to be the
best end, and political science spends most of its pains on making the
citizens to be of a certain character, viz. good and capable of noble acts.

<p>&nbsp;It is natural, then, that we call neither ox nor horse nor any
other of the animals happy; for none of them is capable of sharing in such
activity. For this reason also a boy is not happy; for he is not yet capable
of such acts, owing to his age; and boys who are called happy are being
congratulated by reason of the hopes we have for them. For there is required,
as we said, not only complete excellence but also a complete life, since
many changes occur in life, and all manner of chances, and the most prosperous
may fall into great misfortunes in old age, as is told of Priam in the
Trojan Cycle; and one who has experienced such chances and has ended wretchedly
no one calls happy.

<p>&nbsp;10 ú Must no one at all, then, be called happy while he
lives; must we, as Solon says, see the end? Even if we are to lay down
this doctrine, is it also the case that a man is happy when he is dead?
Or is not this quite absurd, especially for us who say that happiness is
an activity? But if we do not call the dead man happy, and if Solon does
not mean this, but that one can then safely call a man blessed as being
at last beyond evils and misfortunes, this also affords matter for discussion;
for both evil and good are thought to exist for a dead man, as much as
for one who is alive but not aware of them; e.g. honours and dishonours
and the good or bad fortunes of children and in general of descendants.
And this also presents a problem; for though a man has lived blessedly
up to old age and has had a death worthy of his life, many reverses may
befall his descendants--some of them may be good and attain the life they
deserve, while with others the opposite may be the case; and clearly too
the degrees of relationship between them and their ancestors may vary indefinitely.
It would be odd, then, if the dead man were to share in these changes and
become at one time happy, at another wretched; while it would also be odd
if the fortunes of the descendants did not for some time have some effect
on the happiness of their ancestors.

<p>&nbsp;But we must return to our first difficulty; for perhaps by a consideration
of it our present problem might be solved. Now if we must see the end and
only then call a man blessed, not as being blessed but as having been so
before, surely it is odd that when he is happy the attribute that belongs
to him is not to be truly predicated of him because we do not wish to call
living men happy, on account of the changes that may befall them, and because
we have assumed happiness to be something permanent and by no means easily
changed, while a single man may suffer many turns of fortune's wheel. For
clearly if we were to follow his fortunes, we should often call the same
man happy and again wretched, making the happy man out to be a 'chameleon
and insecurely based'. Or is this following his fortunes quite wrong? Success
or failure in life does not depend on these, but human life, as we said,
needs these as well, while excellent activities or their opposites are
what determine happiness or the reverse.

<p>&nbsp;The question we have now discussed confirms our definition. For
no function of man has so much permanence as excellent activities (these
are thought to be more durable even than knowledge), and of these themselves
the most valuable are more durable because those who are blessed spend
their life most readily and most continuously in these; for this seems
to be the reason why we do not forget them. The attribute in question,
then, will belong to the happy man, and he will be happy throughout his
life; for always, or by preference to everything else, he will do and contemplate
what is excellent, and he will bear the chances of life most nobly and
altogether decorously, if he is 'truly good' and 'foursquare beyond reproach'.

<p>&nbsp;Now many events happen by chance, and events differing in importance;
small pieces of good fortune or of its opposite clearly do not weigh down
the scales of life one way or the other, but a multitude of great events
if they turn out well will make life more blessed (for not only are they
themselves such as to add beauty to life, but the way a man deals with
them may be noble and good), while if they turn out ill they crush and
maim blessedness; for they both bring pain with them and hinder many activities.
Yet even in these nobility shines through, when a man bears with resignation
many great misfortunes, not through insensibility to pain but through nobility
and greatness of soul.

<p><b>&nbsp;If activities are, as we said, what determines the character
of life, no blessed man can become miserable; for he will never do the
acts that are hateful and mean.</b> For the man who is truly good and wise,
we think, bears all the chances of life becomingly and always makes the
best of circumstances, as a good general makes the best military use of
the army at his command and a shoemaker makes the best shoes out of the
hides that are given him; and so with all other craftsmen. And if this
is the case, the happy man can never become miserable--though he will not
reach blessedness, if he meet with fortunes like those of Priam.

<p>&nbsp;Nor, again, is he many-coloured and changeable; for neither will
he be moved from his happy state easily or by any ordinary misadventures,
but only by many great ones, nor, if he has had many great misadventures,
will he recover his happiness in a short time, but if at all, only in a
long and complete one in which he has attained many splendid successes.

<p>&nbsp;<b>Why then should we not say that he is happy who is active in
conformity with complete excellence and is sufficiently equipped with external
goods, not for some chance period but throughout a complete life?</b> Or
must we add 'and who is destined to live thus and die as befits his life'?
Certainly the future is obscure to us, while happiness, we claim, is an
end and something in every way final. If so, we shall call blessed those
among living men in whom these conditions are, and are to be, fulfilled--but
blessed men. So much for these questions.

<p>[text omitted]

<p>&nbsp;12 ú These questions having been answered, <i>let us consider
whether happiness is among the things that are praised or rather among
the things that are prized; for clearly it is not to be placed among potentialities</i>.
Everything that is praised seems to be praised because it is of a certain
kind and is related somehow to something else; for we praise the just or
brave man and in general both the good man and excellence itself because
of the actions and functions involved, and we praise the strong man, the
good runner, and so on, because he is of a certain kind and is related
in a certain way to something good and important. This is clear also from
the praises of the gods; for it seems absurd that the gods should be referred
to our standard, but this is done because praise involves a reference,
as we said, to something else. But if praise is for things such as we have
described, clearly what applies to the best things is not praise, but something
greater and better, as is indeed obvious; for what we do to the gods and
the most godlike of men is to call them blessed and happy. And so too with
good things; no one praises happiness as he does justice, but rather calls
it blessed, as being something more divine and better.

<p>&nbsp;Eudoxus also seems to have been right in his method of advocating
the supremacy of pleasure; he thought that the fact that, though a good,
it is not praised indicated it to be better than the things that are praised,
and that this is what God and the good are; for by reference to these all
other things are judged. Praise is appropriate to excellence; for as a
result of excellence men tend to do noble deeds (encomia are bestowed on
acts, whether of the body or of the soul--but perhaps nicety in these matters
is more proper to those who have made a study of encomia); but to us it
is clear from what has been said that happiness is among the things that
are prized and complete. It seems to be so also from the fact that it is
a first principle; for it is for the sake of this that we all do everything
else, and the first principle and cause of goods is, we claim, something
prized and divine.

<p>&nbsp;13&nbsp; <b>Since happiness is an activity of soul in accordance
with complete excellence, we must consider the nature of excellence; for
perhaps we shall thus see better the nature of happiness</b>. The true
student of politics, too, is thought to have studied this above all things;
for he wishes to make his fellow citizens good and obedient to the laws.
As an example of this we have the lawgivers of the Cretans and the Spartans,
and any others of the kind that there may have been. And if this inquiry
belongs to political science, clearly the pursuit of it will be in accordance
with our original plan. But clearly the excellence we must study is human
excellence; for the good we were seeking was human good and the happiness
human happiness. By human excellence we mean not that of the body but that
of the soul; and happiness also we call an activity of soul. But if this
is so, clearly the student of politics must know somehow the facts about
soul, as the man who is to heal the eyes must know about the whole body
also; and all the more since politics is more prized and better than medicine;
but even among doctors the best educated spend much labour on acquiring
knowledge of the body. The student of politics, then, must study the soul,
and must study it with these objects in view, and do so just to the extent
which is sufficient for the questions we are discussing; for further precision
is perhaps something more laborious than our purposes require.

<p>&nbsp;<b>Excellence too is distinguished into kinds in accordance with
this difference; for we say that some excellences are intellectual and
others moral</b>, philosophic wisdom and understanding and practical wisdom
being intellectual, liberality and temperance moral. For in speaking about
a man's character we do not say that he is wise or has understanding but
that he is good-tempered or temperate; yet we praise the wise man also
with respect to his state; and of states we call those which merit praise
excellences.
