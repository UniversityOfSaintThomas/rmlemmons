First 
Seminar 
of 
the 
Catholic-Muslim 
Forum 
Rome, 
4-6 
November 
2008 


Final 
Declaration 


The 
Catholic-Muslim 
Forum 
was 
formed 
by 
the 
Pontifical 
Council 
for 
Interreligious 
Dialogue 
and 
a 
delegation 
of 
the 
138 
Muslim 
signatories 
of 
the 
open 
letter 
called 
A 
Common 
Word, 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
same 
document 
and 
the 
response 
of 
His 
Holiness 
Benedict 
XVI 
through 
his 
Secretary 
of 
State, 
Cardinal 
Tarcisio 
Bertone. 
Its 
first 
Seminar 
was 
held 
in 
Rome 
from 
4-6 
November 
2008. 
Twenty-four 
participants 
and 
five 
advisors 
from 
each 
religion 
took 
part 
in 
the 
meeting. 
The 
theme 
of 
the 
Seminar 
was "Love 
of 
God, 
Love 
of 
Neighbour". 


The 
discussion, 
conducted 
in 
a 
warm 
and 
convivial 
spirit, 
focused 
on 
two 
great 
themes: "Theological 
and 
Spiritual 
Foundations" 
and "Human 
Dignity 
and 
Mutual 
Respect". 
Points 
of 
similarity 
and 
of 
diversity 
emerged, 
reflecting 
the 
distinctive 
specific 
genius 
of 
the 
two 
religions. 


1. 
For 
Christians 
the 
source 
and 
example 
of 
love 
of 
God 
and 
neighbour 
is 
the 
love 
of 
Christ 
for 
his 
Father, 
for 
humanity 
and 
for 
each 
person. "God 
is 
Love" (1 
Jn 
4, 
16) 
and 
“God 
so 
loved 
the 
world 
that 
He 
gave 
his 
only 
Son 
so 
that 
whoever 
believes 
in 
him 
shall 
not 
perish 
but 
have 
eternal 
life” 
(Jn 
3,16). 
God’s 
love 
is 
placed 
in 
the 
human 
heart 
through 
the 
Holy 
Spirit. 
It 
is 
God 
who 
first 
loves 
us 
thereby 
enabling 
us 
to 
love 
Him 
in 
return. 
Love 
does 
not 
harm 
one's 
neighbour 
but 
rather 
seeks 
to 
do 
to 
the 
other 
what 
one 
would 
want 
done 
to 
oneself 
(Cf. 
1 
Cor 
13, 
4-7). 
Love 
is 
the 
foundation 
and 
sum 
of 
all 
the 
commandments 
(Cf. 
Gal 
5, 
14). 
Love 
of 
neighbour 
cannot 
be 
separated 
from 
love 
of 
God, 
because 
it 
is 
an 
expression 
of 
our 
love 
for 
God. 
This 
is 
the 
new 
commandment, "Love 
one 
another 
as 
I 
have 
loved 
you." (Jn 
15, 
12) 
Grounded 
in 
Christ’s 
sacrificial 
love, 
Christian 
love 
is 
forgiving 
and 
excludes 
no 
one; 
it 
therefore 
also 
includes 
one's 

enemies. 
It 
should 
be 
not 
just 
words 
but 
deeds 
(Cf. 
1 
Jn, 
4, 
18). 
This 
is 
the 
sign 
of 
its 
genuineness. 


For 
Muslims, 
as 
set 
out 
in 
A 
Common 
Word, 
love 
is 
a 
timeless 
transcendent 
power 
which 
guides 
and 
transforms 
human 
mutual 
regard. 
This 
love, 
as 
indicated 
by 
the 
Holy 
and 
Beloved 
Prophet 
Muhammad, 
is 
prior 
to 
the 
human 
love 
for 
the 
One 
True 
God. 
A 
Hadith 
indicates 
that 
God’s 
loving 
compassion 
for 
humanity 
is 
even 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
a 
mother 
for 
her 
child 
(Muslim, 
Bab 
al-
Tawba: 
21); 
it 
therefore 
exists 
before 
and 
independently 
of 
the 
human 
response 
to 
the 
One 
who 
is 
‘The 
Loving’. 
So 
immense 
is 
this 
love 
and 
compassion 
that 
God 
has 
intervened 
to 
guide 
and 
save 
humanity 
in 
a 
perfect 
way 
many 
times 
and 
in 
many 
places, 
by 
sending 
prophets 
and 
scriptures. 
The 
last 
of 
these 
books, 
the 
Qur’an, 
portrays 
a 
world 
of 
signs, 
a 
marvellous 
cosmos 
of 
Divine 
artistry, 
which 
calls 
forth 
our 
utter 
love 
and 
devotion, 
so 
that 
‘those 
who 
have 
faith, 
have 
most 
love 
of 
God’ 
(2:165), 
and 
‘those 
that 
believe, 
and 
do 
good 
works, 
the 
Merciful 
shall 
engender 
love 
among 
them.’ 
(19:96) 
In 
a 
Hadith 
we 
read 
that 
‘Not 
one 
of 
you 
has 
faith 
until 
he 
loves 
for 
his 
neighbour 
what 
he 
loves 
for 
himself’ 
(Bukhari, 
Bab 
al-Iman: 
13). 


2. 
Human 
life 
is 
a 
most 
precious 
gift 
of 
God 
to 
each 
person. 
It 
should 
therefore 
be 
preserved 
and 
honoured 
in 
all 
its 
stages. 
3. 
Human 
dignity 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
every 
human 
person 
is 
created 
by 
a 
loving 
God, 
and 
has 
been 
endowed 
with 
the 
gifts 
of 
reason 
and 
free 
will, 
and 
therefore 
enabled 
to 
love 
God 
and 
others. 
On 
the 
firm 
basis 
of 
these 
principles, 
the 
person 
requires 
the 
respect 
of 
his 
or 
her 
original 
dignity 
and 
his 
or 
her 
human 
vocation. 
Therefore, 
he 
or 
she 
is 
entitled 
to 
full 
recognition 
of 
his 
or 
her 
identity 
and 
freedom 
by 
individuals, 
communities 
and 
governments, 
supported 
by 
civil 
legislation 
that 
assures 
equal 
rights 
and 
full 
citizenship. 
4. 
We 
affirm 
that 
God’s 
creation 
of 
humanity 
has 
two 
great 
aspects: 
the 
male 
and 
the 
female 
human 
person, 
and 
we 
commit 

ourselves 
jointly 
to 
ensuring 
that 
human 
dignity 
and 
respect 
are 
extended 
on 
an 
equal 
basis 
to 
both 
men 
and 
women. 


5. 
Genuine 
love 
of 
neighbour 
implies 
respect 
of 
the 
person 
and 
her 
or 
his 
choices 
in 
matters 
of 
conscience 
and 
religion. 
It 
includes 
the 
right 
of 
individuals 
and 
communities 
to 
practice 
their 
religion 
in 
private 
and 
public. 
6. 
Religious 
minorities 
are 
entitled 
to 
be 
respected 
in 
their 
own 
religious 
convictions 
and 
practices. 
They 
are 
also 
entitled 
to 
their 
own 
places 
of 
worship, 
and 
their 
founding 
figures 
and 
symbols 
they 
consider 
sacred 
should 
not 
be 
subject 
to 
any 
form 
of 
mockery 
or 
ridicule. 
7. 
As 
Catholic 
and 
Muslim 
believers, 
we 
are 
aware 
of 
the 
summons 
and 
imperative 
to 
bear 
witness 
to 
the 
transcendent 
dimension 
of 
life, 
through 
a 
spirituality 
nourished 
by 
prayer, 
in 
a 
world 
which 
is 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
secularized 
and 
materialistic. 
8. 
We 
affirm 
that 
no 
religion 
and 
its 
followers 
should 
be 
excluded 
from 
society. 
Each 
should 
be 
able 
to 
make 
its 
indispensable 
contribution 
to 
the 
good 
of 
society, 
especially 
in 
service 
to 
the 
most 
needy. 
9. 
We 
recognize 
that 
God’s 
creation 
in 
its 
plurality 
of 
cultures, 
civilizations, 
languages 
and 
peoples 
is 
a 
source 
of 
richness 
and 
should 
therefore 
never 
become 
a 
cause 
of 
tension 
and 
conflict. 
10. 
We 
are 
convinced 
that 
Catholics 
and 
Muslims 
have 
the 
duty 
to 
provide 
a 
sound 
education 
in 
human, 
civic, 
religious 
and 
moral 
values 
for 
their 
respective 
members 
and 
to 
promote 
accurate 
information 
about 
each 
other’s 
religions. 
11.We 
profess 
that 
Catholics 
and 
Muslims 
are 
called 
to 
be 
instruments 
of 
love 
and 
harmony 
among 
believers, 
and 
for 
humanity 
as 
a 
whole, 
renouncing 
any 
oppression, 
aggressive 



violence 
and 
terrorism, 
especially 
that 
committed 
in 
the 
name 
of 
religion, 
and 
upholding 
the 
principle 
of 
justice 
for 
all. 


12. 
We 
call 
upon 
believers 
to 
work 
for 
an 
ethical 
financial 
system 
in 
which 
the 
regulatory 
mechanisms 
consider 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
disadvantaged, 
both 
as 
individuals, 
and 
as 
indebted 
nations. 
We 
call 
upon 
the 
privileged 
of 
the 
world 
to 
consider 
the 
plight 
of 
those 
afflicted 
most 
severely 
by 
the 
current 
crisis 
in 
food 
production 
and 
distribution, 
and 
ask 
religious 
believers 
of 
all 
denominations 
and 
all 
people 
of 
good 
will 
to 
work 
together 
to 
alleviate 
the 
suffering 
of 
the 
hungry, 
and 
to 
eliminate 
its 
causes. 
13.Young 
people 
are 
the 
future 
of 
religious 
communities 
and 
of 
societies 
as 
a 
whole. 
Increasingly, 
they 
will 
be 
living 
in 
multicultural 
and 
multireligious 
societies. 
It 
is 
essential 
that 
they 
be 
well 
formed 
in 
their 
own 
religious 
traditions 
and 
well 
informed 
about 
other 
cultures 
and 
religions. 


14.We 
have 
agreed 
to 
explore 
the 
possibility 
of 
establishing 
a 
permanent 
Catholic-Muslim 
committee 
to 
coordinate 
responses 
to 
conflicts 
and 
other 
emergency 
situations. 


15. 
We 
look 
forward 
to 
the 
second 
Seminar 
of 
the 
Catholic-Muslim 
Forum 
to 
be 
convened 
in 
approximately 
two 
years 
in 
a 
Muslim-
majority 
country 
yet 
to 
be 
determined. 
All 
participants 
felt 
gratitude 
to 
God 
for 
the 
gift 
of 
their 
time 
together 
and 
for 
an 
enriching 
exchange. 


At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Seminar 
His 
Holiness 
Pope 
Benedict 
XVI 
received 
the 
participants 
and, 
following 
addresses 
by 
Professor 
Dr. 
Seyyed 
Hossein 
Nasr 
and 
H.E. 
Grand 
Mufti 
Dr. 
Mustafa 
Ceric, 
spoke 
to 
the 
group. 
All 
present 
expressed 
satisfaction 
with 
the 
results 
of 
the 
Seminar 
and 
their 
expectation 
for 
further 
productive 
dialogue.
