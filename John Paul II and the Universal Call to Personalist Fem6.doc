{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Accordingly, heterosexual love and spousal oneness image nothing less than the love and oneness of the Trinity, \softline
wherein the distinction of persons{\u8212\'97}and roles---preclude neither unity nor equality. As a result, any inequality \softline
between man and woman would distort this sacred Trinitarian image. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab The spousal unification in love excels in imaging the triune God in the following ways: (1) by being a unit \softline

}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Hence, the human vocation to love in the image of the Trinity bestows upon femininity and masculinity \softline
their proper meanings: self-transcendence through a fruitful love between distinct equals. This is the nuptial meaning \softline
of the human body: sexuality is for facilitating a fruitful Trinitarian-like love. Sex is for self-giving love. This is not \softline
to say however that sexual love is the fulfillment of love. It is rather to say that the fulfillment of love is finding a \softline
way to seek the good of others. The second basic truth is thus that women }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 (and men), find fulfillment in and through \softline
love.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Third basic truth: Male Oppression of Women Continues}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab John Paul II argues that due to Original Sin, men routinely oppress women and that Christ accordingly \softline
sought to restore woman to the equality, respect and dignity that was hers in the beginning, that is, before Original \softline
Sin.{}{\plain \fs24 \super 8{\footnote \pard \fs20\sa240

dismay of others recorded in Jn 4:27 and Lk 7:39; hence also, the revolutionary character of his teaching against \softline
stoning women adulterers, divorce and lust recorded  in Jn 8:3-11, Mt. 19:3-8 and Mt 5:28, respectively.}}}
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  Original Sin, moreover, not only ruptured the relationship of human beings to God but also the relationship \softline
between men and women. }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Genesis}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  3:16 is quite explicit that some penalties of Original Sin are gender-specific, \softline
affecting even the spousal union of love:  {\u8220\'93}Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.{\u8221\'94}  In \softline
other words, Original Sin left woman with the desire to close her love in upon her husband and make him the source \softline
of her happiness, while Original Sin left men with the desire to dominate women. Yielding to either desire is the \softline
wellspring of sexual inequality and oppression. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab The gender ramifications of Original Sin have yet to be fully recognized. Even some Christian marriages \softline
embody spousal inequality by unilaterally subordinating the wife to the husband.  In this regard, two passages are \softline
cited most frequently:}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20  Genesis}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  2:18-25 in which God declares that Adam will receive a helper fit for him; and }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Eph.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  \softline
5:22-23 in which wives are told to be submissive to their husbands.  Being a helper and being submissive can be \softline
understood either as a gender role peculiar to wives or as a spousal role common to both men and women. The first \softline
interpretation establishes an inequality that contradicts the equality required by }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Genesis}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  1:27. It also misunderstands \softline
the story of Adam and Eve. According to John Paul II, the }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Genesis}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  text that brings woman forth from Adam{\u8217\'92}s rib 
confirms her equality.{}{\plain \fs24 \super 9{\footnote \pard \fs24\sa240

}{\plain \fs20 \super\fs20 }{\plain \fs20 \fs20   Taking these texts as his guide, John Paul II argues that the Scriptural texts identifying the \softline

}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Ninth Basic Truth: Personalist Feminism is pro-life and pro-maternity. }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab At all times, personalist feminism takes as its principle of specification, or proper action, the truths about \softline
women{\u8212\'97}including her ability to conceive and nurture new life. To kill her offspring, whether unborn or born, is thus \softline
to attack her femininity and demean her value as a woman as well as to destroy a new human life; it is utterly \softline
morally reprehensible. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Women are also attacked and trivialized whenever her reproductive powers are isolated and manipulated \softline
through biotechnology that farms her eggs for }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 in vitro}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  fertilizations and implants those fertilized eggs into the \softline
wombs of strangers. The reduction of maternity to a form of living biotechnology asserts that maternity is not a \softline
personal act whereby a woman{\u8217\'92}s love nurtures the little one but a productive act that lacks intrinsic value. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Such trivialization of maternity not only insults women (and thereby the Creator) but makes the child a \softline
product of technology. Thus, }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 in vitro}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  fertilization technologies trivialize the preciousness of human life and distort \softline
the basic truths of womanhood. In other words, since}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  women bring new life into the world, to be anti-life is to be \softline
anti-woman----just as, adopting artificial means of reproduction is also to be anti-woman. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Denigrating the value of new human life and maternity (both physical and spiritual) disorient women and \softline

sexual complementarity, spousal oneness and children.{}{\plain \fs24 \super 30{\footnote \pard \fs24\sa240

}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Tenth Truth: The Feminine Genius for Love Extends to the Spirit.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab The maternal orientation is the source of what John Paul II calls their feminine genius insofar as women not \softline
only are sensitive to the truth about others but also insofar as women can {\u8220\'93}ensure sensitivity for human beings in \softline
every circumstance.{\u8221\'94}{}{\plain \fs24 \super 31{\footnote \pard \fs20\sa240

}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  And since it takes sensitivity to love effectively, it takes the genius of women to figure out \softline
how to best love others and enable them achieve ultimate fulfillment by union with God. For this reason, John Paul \softline
II speaks of women having a prophetic femininity that makes {\u8220\'93}manifest that very human being is loved by God in \softline
Christ.{\u8221\'94}{}{\plain \fs24 \super 32{\footnote \pard \fs20\sa240

}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  This means that women can be not only mothers in the flesh but also mothers in the spirit, as explained by \softline
John Paul II: \par

{\plain \fs20 \fs20 }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Each and every time that motherhood is repeated in human history, it is always related to the Covenant \softline
which God established with the human race through the motherhood of the Mother of God. Does not Jesus \softline
bear witness to this reality which he answers the exclamation of that woman in the crowd who blessed him 
for Mary{\u8217\'92}s motherhood: {\u8216\'91}Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts that you sucked{\u33\'21}{\u8221\'94}? Jesus \softline
replies: {\u8220\'93}Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it{\u8221\'94} (Lk 11:27-28).  Jesus confirms the \softline
meaning of motherhood in reference to the body, but at the same time he indicates an even deeper meaning, \softline
which is connected with the order of the spirit: it is a sign of the Covenant with God who {\u8216\'91}is spirit{\u8217\'92} (Jn \softline
4:24). . . .  The motherhood of every woman, understood in light of the Gospel, is similarly not only {\u8216\'91}of \softline
flesh and blood{\u8221\'94}: it expresses a profound {\u8216\'91}listening to the word of the living God{\u8217\'92} and a readiness to \softline
{\u8216\'91}safeguard{\u8217\'92} this Word.  }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Mulieris Dignitatem }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 #19.\par

{\plain \fs20 \fs20 In this way, Christ himself revealed the basic truth that women are to be spiritual mothers and bring God{\u8217\'92}s word to \softline
life in the world. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 This revelation is a great gift to all women but especially to those who are single or infertile because it \softline
reassures them that not only does the world need their maternal genius for love but so does God: just as God counted \softline
on the Virgin Mary, so God counts on women to light the world with His love. \par

}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Eleventh Truth: Men Need to be Personalist Feminists}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Women cannot fully exercise their feminine genius for promoting human dignity when men do not seek \softline
their collaboration or otherwise fail to respect the basic truths about women. Indeed, unless men fully commit to \softline
personalist feminism, they will fail to see the need to be proactive in remedying within themselves and within every \softline
institution all those ways that women are oppressed. They will also fail to see the need to collaborate with women in \softline
the building of the civilization of love.  And this civilization of love cannot be built without the insights of women \softline
who must bring their feminine genius to bear on the problem of structuring institutions to respect the person. Men \softline
must therefore be personalist feminists before the civilization of love can be fully realized.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab The civilization of love thus requires all to answer the call to personalist feminism and to seek to counter \softline
the gender effects of Original Sin by honoring, at the very least, these basic truths about women: (1) women are the \softline
equals of men; (2) the sexuality of women is designed for spousal oneness with their sexual complements (i.e., men); \softline
(3) women{\u8212\'97}like men{\u8212\'97}achieve fulfillment only through love; (4) women still suffer from male oppression due to \softline
Original Sin; (5) male oppression can be countered only through the love prescribed by the personalistic norm and \softline
embodied in the practice of personalist feminism; (6) personalistic love identifies collaboration to be essential to \softline
human interaction including male/female interaction; (7) personalistic feminism{\u8212\'97}like the Church{\u8212\'97}seeks to \softline
humanize the world; (8-9) maternity{\u8212\'97}whether biological or spiritual{\u8212\'97}is essential to the fulfillment of women; and \softline
(10) men need to become personalist feminists.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Since it is not a kindness to women to disregard her genius in promoting the welfare of others, to kill her \softline
children, to attack her maternity, to refuse to collaborate with her, to reduce her to the status of a sexual object or a \softline
beast of burden, and to fail to love her as an equal.  \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab It is thus not the Church who oppresses women but contemporary culture. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab \par
}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 In Conclusion}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 : \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Since all are called to a collaborative and providential love that is eager to oppose evil whenever and \softline
where-ever possible and since the oppression of women continues due to the weaknesses caused by Original Sin, all \softline
are called to promote the dignity and well-being of women by honoring the truths about women. And since this is \softline
what is means to be called to personalist feminism, the call of personalist feminism is a universal call. \par
