<p><font face="Arial Black"><font size="-1">In the movie &quot;First Knight,&quot;
Lancelot must make several decisions about how to live his life and about
what are the most important values to seek.&nbsp; Lancelot makes four key
decisions: (1) the decision to become a fighter who drifts from village
to village;&nbsp; (2) the decision(s) to rescue Genievere; (3) the decision
to join King Arthur's Round Table; and (4) the decision to leave that Table.&nbsp;
These decisions are made according to Lancelot's values. Does Lancelot
have one supreme value that never changes or does his values changes? What
is most important to Lancelot? How does Lancelot view himself? What is
his philosophy of life or his philosophy of person? Whom have we studied
that would be most pleased with Lancelot's actions? Does Lancelot ever
love King Arthur? Does King Arthur love Lancelot? Are there any critical
differences between Lancelot and King Arthur? How does Lancelot differ
from Malagant; Is this difference significant?Compare the values embodied
in Lancelot's decisions to the philosophies of person presented in the
handouts &quot;The Drive to Give Oneself Away&quot; and &quot;The Metaphysics of Love.&quot;
Did King Arthur, in &quot;First Knight&quot;&nbsp; tap into this psychology of self
giving when he created the Knights of the Round Table? Does Malagant, the
evil knight and warlord, defy this philosophy of self giving?</font></font><font face="Arial Black"><font size="-1"></font></font>

the drive to be self giving? (3) If movie had ended with Lancelot and Malagant
