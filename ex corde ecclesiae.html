<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>INTRODUCTION<BR>&nbsp;</B></P>
<P>BORN FROM THE HEART of the Church, a Catholic University is located in that
course of tradition which may be traced back to the very origin of the
University as an institution. It has always been recognized as an incomparable
centre of creativity and dissemination of knowledge for the good of humanity. By
vocation, the <I>Universitas magistrorum et scholarium </I>is dedicated to
research, to teaching and to the education of students who freely associate with
their teachers in a common love of knowledge(1). With every other University it
shares that <I>gaudium de veritate, </I>so precious to Saint Augustine, which
is that joy of searching for, discovering and communicating truth(2) in every
field of knowledge. A Catholic University's privileged task is &quot;to unite
existentially by intellectual effort two orders of reality that too frequently
tend to be placed in opposition as though they were antithetical: the search for
truth, and the certainty of already knowing the fount of truth&quot;(3).</P>
<P>2. For many years I myself was deeply enriched by the beneficial experience
of university life: the ardent search for truth and its unselfish transmission
to youth and to all those learning to think rigorously, so as to act rightly and
to serve humanity better.</P>
<P>Therefore, I desire to share with everyone my profound respect for Catholic
Universities, and to express my great appreciation for the work that is being
done in them in the various spheres of knowledge. In a particular way, I wish to
manifest my joy at the numerous meetings which the Lord has permitted me to have
in the course of my apostolic journeys with the Catholic University communities
of various continents. They are for me a lively and promising sign of the
fecundity of the Christian mind in the heart of every culture. They give me a
well-founded hope for a new flowering of Christian culture in the rich and
varied context of our changing times, which certainly face serious challenges
but which also bear so much promise under the action of the Spirit of truth and
of love.</P>
<P>It is also my desire to express my pleasure and gratitude to the very many
Catholic scholars engaged in teaching and research in non-Catholic Universities.
Their task as academics and scientists, lived out in the light of the Christian
faith, is to be considered precious for the good of the Universities in which
they teach. Their presence, in fact, is a continuous stimulus to the selfless
search for truth and for the wisdom that comes from above.</P>
<P>3. Since the beginning of this Pontificate, I have shared these ideas and
sentiments with my closest collaborators, the Cardinals, with the Congregation
for Catholic Education, and with men and women of culture throughout the world.
In fact, the dialogue of the Church with the cultures of our times is that vital
area where &quot;the future of the Church and of the world is being played out
as we conclude the twentieth century&quot;(4). There is only one cultre: that of
man, by man and for man(5). And thanks to her Catholic Universities and their
humanistic and scientific inheritance, the Church, expert in humanity, as my
predecessor, Paul VI, expressed it at the United Nations(6), explores the
mysteries of humanity and of the world, clarifying them in the light of
Revelation.</P>
<P>4. It is the honour and responsibility of a Catholic University to
consecrate itself without reserve to <I>the cause of truth. </I>This is its way
of serving at one and the same time both the dignity of man and the good of the
Church, which has &quot;an intimate conviction that truth is (its) real ally ...
and that knowledge and reason are sure ministers to faith&quot;(7). Without in
any way neglecting the acquisition of useful knowledge, a Catholic University is
distinguished by its free search for the whole truth about nature, man and God.
The present age is in urgent need of this kind of disinterested service, namely
of <I>proclaiming the meaning of truth, </I>that fundamental value without
which freedom, justice and human dignity are extinguished. By means of a kind of
universal humanism a Catholic University is completely dedicated to the research
of all aspects of truth in their essential connection with the supreme Truth,
who is God. It does this without fear but rather with enthusiasm, dedicating
itself to every path of knowledge, aware of being preceded by him who is &quot;the
Way, the Truth, and the Life&quot;(8), the <I>Logos, </I>whose Spirit of
intelligence and love enables the human person with his or her own intelligence
to find the ultimate reality of which he is the source and end and who alone is
capable of giving fully that Wisdom without which the future of the world would
be in danger.</P>
<P>5. It is in the context of the impartial search for truth that the
relationship between faith and reason is brought to light and meaning. The
invitation of Saint Augustine, <I>&quot;Intellege ut credas; crede ut
intellegas&quot;</I>(9), is relevant to Catholic Universities that are called to
explore courageously the riches of Revelation and of nature so that the united
endeavour of intelligence and faith will enable people to come to the full
measure of their humanity, created in the image and likeness of God, renewed
even more marvellously, after sin, in Christ, and called to shine forth in the
light of the Spirit.</P>
<P>6. Through the encounter which it establishes between the unfathomable
richness of the salvific message of the Gospel and the variety and immensity of
the fields of knowledge in which that richness is incarnated by it, a Catholic
University enables the Church to institute an incomparably fertile dialogue with
people of every culture. Man's life is given dignity by culture, and, while he
finds his fullness in Christ, there can be no doubt that the Gospel which
reaches and renews him in every dimension is also fruitful for the culture in
which he lives.</P>
<P>7. In the world today, characterized by such rapid developments in science
and technology, the tasks of a Catholic University assume an ever greater
importance and urgency. Scientific and technological discoveries create an
enormous economic and industrial growth, but they also inescapably require the
correspondingly necessary <I>search for meaning</I>  in order to guarantee that
the new discoveries be used for the authentic good of individuals and of human
society as a whole. If it is the responsibility of every University to search
for such meaning, a Catholic University is called in a particular way to respond
to this need: its Christian inspiration enables it to include the moral,
spiritual and religious dimension in its research, and to evaluate the
attainments of science and technology in the perspective of the totality of the
human person.</P>
<P>In this context, Catholic Universities are called to a continuous renewal,
both as &quot;Universities&quot; and as &quot;Catholic&quot;. For, &quot;What is
at stake is the <I>very meaning of scientific and technological research, of
social life and of culture, </I>but, on an even more profound level, what is at
stake is <I>the very meaning of the human person&quot;</I>(10). Such renewal
requires a clear awareness that, by its Catholic character, a University is made
more capable of conducting an <I>impartial </I>search for truth, a search that
is neither subordinated to nor conditioned by particular interests of any kind.</P>
<P>8. Having already dedicated the Apostolic Constitution <I>Sapientia
Christiana </I>to Ecclesiastical Faculties and Universities(11), I then felt
obliged to propose an analogous Document for Catholic Universities as a sort of
&quot;magna carta&quot;, enriched by the long and fruitful experience of the
Church in the realm of Universities and open to the promise of future
achievements that will require courageous creativity and rigorous fidelity.</P>
<P>9. The present Document is addressed especially to those who conduct
Catholic Universities, to the respective academic communities, to all those who
have an interest in them, particularly the Bishops, Religious Congregations and
ecclesial <I>Institutions, </I>and to the numerous laity who are committed to
the great mission of higher education. Its purpose is that &quot;the Christian
mind may achieve, as it were, a public, persistent and universal presence in the
whole enterprise of advancing higher culture and that the students of these
institutions become people outstanding in learning, ready to shoulder society's
heavier burdens and to witness the faith to the world&quot;(12).</P>
<P>10. In addition to Catholic Universities, I also turn to the many Catholic
Institutions of higher education. According to their nature and proper
objectives, they share some or all of the characteristics of a University and
they offer their own contribution to the Church and to society, whether through
research, education or professional training. While this Document specifically
concerns Catholic Universities, it is also meant to include all Catholic
Institutions of higher education engaged in instilling the Gospel message of
Christ in souls and cultures.</P>
<P>Therefore, it is with great trust and hope that I invite all Catholic
Universities to pursue their irreplaceable task. Their mission appears
increasingly necessary for the encounter of the Church with the development of
the sciences and with the cultures of our age.</P>
<P>Together with all my brother Bishops who share pastoral responsibility with
me, I would like to manifest my deep conviction that a Catholic University is
without any doubt one of the best instruments that the Church offers to our age
which is searching for certainty and wisdom. Having the mission of bringing the
Good News to everyone, the Church should never fail to interest herself in this
Institution. By research and teaching, Catholic Universities assist the Church
in the manner most appropriate to modern times to find cultural treasures both
old and new, <I>&quot;nova et vetera&quot;, </I>according to the words of
Jesus(13).</P>
<P>11. Finally, I turn to the whole Church, convinced that Catholic
Universities are essential to her growth and to the development of Christian
culture and human progress. For this reason, the entire ecclesial Community is
invited to give its support to Catholic Institutions of higher education and to
assist them in their process of development and renewal. It is invited in a
special way to guard the rights and freedom of these Institutions in civil
society, and to offer them economic aid, especially in those countries where
they have more urgent need of it, and to furnish assistance in founding new
Catholic Universities wherever this might be necessary.</P>
<P>My hope is that these prescriptions, based on the teaching of Vatican
Council II and the directives of the Code of Canon Law, will enable Catholic
Universities and other Institutes of higher studies to fulfil their
indispensable mission in the new advent of grace that is opening up to the new
Millennium.</P>
<CENTER>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>PART I</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>IDENTITY AND MISSION</B></P></CENTER>
<P><B>A. THE IDENTITY OF A CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY</B></P>
<P> <I><B>1. Nature and Objectives</B></I></P>
<P>12. Every Catholic University, <I>as a university, </I>is an academic
community which, in a rigorous and critical fashion, assists in the protection
and advancement of human dignity and of a cultural heritage through research,
teaching and various services offered to the local, national and international
communities(14).  It possesses that institutional autonomy necessary to perform
its functions effectively and guarantees its members academic freedom, so long
as the rights of the individual person and of the community are preserved within
the confines of the truth and the common good(15).</P>
<P>13. Since the objective of a Catholic University is to assure in an
institutional manner a Christian presence in the university world confronting
the great problems of society and culture(16), every Catholic University, as
<I>Catholic,
</I>must have the following <I>essential characteristics:</I></P>
<P>&quot;1. a Christian inspiration not only of individuals but of the
university community as such;</P>
<P>2. a continuing reflection in the light of the Catholic faith upon the
growing treasury of human knowledge, to which it seeks to contribute by its own
research;</P>
<P>3. fidelity to the Christian message as it comes to us through the Church;</P>
<P>4. an institutional commitment to the service of the people of God and of
the human family in their pilgrimage to the transcendent goal which gives
meaning to life&quot;(17).</P>
<P>14. &quot;In the light of these four characteristics, it is evident that
besides the teaching, research and services common to all Universities, a
Catholic University, by <I>institutional commitment, </I>brings to its task the
inspiration and light of the <I>Christian message. </I>In a Catholic
University, therefore, Catholic ideals, attitudes and principles penetrate and
inform university activities in accordance with the proper nature and autonomy
of these activities. In a word, being both a University and Catholic, it must be
both a community of scholars representing various branches of human knowledge,
and an academic institution in which Catholicism is vitally present and
operative&quot;(18).</P>
<P>15. A Catholic University, therefore, is a place of research, where scholars
<I>scrutinize reality </I>with the methods proper to each academic discipline,
and so contribute to the treasury of human knowledge. Each individual discipline
is studied in a systematic manner; moreover, the various disciplines are brought
into dialogue for their mutual enhancement.</P>
<P>In addition to assisting men and women in their continuing quest for the
truth, this research provides an effective witness, especially necessary today,
to the Church's belief in the intrinsic value of knowledge and research.</P>
<P>In a Catholic University, research necessarily includes <I>(a) </I>the
search for an <I>integration of knowledge, (b) </I>a <I>dialogue between faith
and reason, (c) </I>an <I>ethical concern, </I>and <I>(d) </I>a <I>theological
perspective.</I></P>
<P>16. <I>Integration of knowledge </I>is a process, one which will always
remain incomplete; moreover, the explosion of knowledge in recent decades,
together with the rigid compartmentalization of knowledge within individual
academic disciplines, makes the task increasingly difficult. But a University,
and especially a Catholic University, <I>&quot;has to be a 'living union' of
individual organisms </I>dedicated to the search for truth ... It is necessary
<I>to work towards a higher synthesis </I>of knowledge, in which alone lies the
possibility of satisfying that thirst for truth which is profoundly inscribed on
the heart of the human person&quot;(19). Aided by the specific contributions of
philosophy and theology, university scholars will be engaged in a constant
effort to determine the relative place and meaning of each of the various
disciplines within the context of a vision of the human person and the world
that is enlightened by the Gospel, and therefore by a faith in Christ, the <I>Logos,
</I>as the centre of creation and of human history.</P>
<P>17. In promoting this integration of knowledge, a specific part of a
Catholic University's task is to promote <I>dialogue between faith and reason,</I>
so that it can be seen more profoundly how faith and reason bear harmonious
witness to the unity of all truth. While each academic discipline retains its
own integrity and has its own methods, this dialogue demonstrates that &quot;methodical
research within every branch of learning, when carried out in a truly scientific
manner and in accord with moral norms, can never truly conflict with faith. For
the things of the earth and the concerns of faith derive from the same God&quot;(20).
 A vital interaction of two distinct levels of coming to know the one truth
leads to a greater love for truth itself, and contributes to a more
comprehensive understanding of the meaning of human life and of the purpose of
God's creation.</P>
<P>18. Because knowledge is meant to serve the human person, research in a
Catholic University is always carried out with a concern for the <I>ethical
</I>and <I>moral implications </I>both of its methods and of its discoveries.
This concern, while it must be present in all research, is particularly
important in the areas of science and technology. &quot;It is essential that we
be convinced of the priority of the ethical over the technical, of the primacy
of the person over things, of the superiority of the spirit over matter. The
cause of the human person will only be served if knowledge is joined to
conscience. Men and women of science will truly aid humanity only if they
preserve 'the sense of the transcendence of the human person over the world and
of God over the human person&quot;(21).</P>
<P>19. <I>Theology</I> plays a particularly important role in the search for a
synthesis of knowledge as well as in the dialogue between faith and reason. It
serves all other disciplines in their search for meaning, not only by helping
them to investigate how their discoveries will affect individuals and society
but also by bringing a perspective and an orientation not contained within their
own methodologies. In turn, interaction with these other disciplines and their
discoveries enriches theology, offering it a better understanding of the world
today, and making theological research more relevant to current needs. Because
of its specific importance among the academic disciplines, every Catholic
University should have a faculty, or at least a chair, of  theology(22).</P>
<P>20. Given the close connection between research and teaching, the research
qualities indicated above will have their influence on all teaching. While each
discipline is taught systematically and according to its own methods, <I>interdisciplinary
studies, </I>assisted by a careful and thorough study of philosophy and
theology, enable students to acquire an organic vision of reality and to develop
a continuing desire for intellectual progress. In the communication of
knowledge, emphasis is then placed on how <I>human reason in its reflection
</I>opens to increasingly broader questions, and how the complete answer to them
can only come from above through faith. Furthermore, the <I>moral implications
</I>that are present in each discipline are examined as an integral part of the
teaching of that discipline so that the entire educative process be directed
towards the whole development of the person. Finally, Catholic theology, taught
in a manner faithful to Scripture, Tradition, and the Church's Magisterium,
provides an awareness of the Gospel principles which will enrich the meaning of
human life and give it a new dignity.</P>
<P>Through research and teaching the students are educated in the various
disciplines so as to become truly competent in the specific sectors in which
they will devote themselves to the service of society and of the Church, but at
the same time prepared to give the witness of their faith to the world.</P>
<P><I><B>2. The University Community</B></I></P>
<P>21. A Catholic University pursues its objectives through its formation of an
authentic human community animated by the spirit of Christ. The source of its
unity springs from a common dedication to the truth, a common vision of the
dignity of the human person and, ultimately, the person and message of Christ
which gives the Institution its distinctive character. As a result of this
inspiration, the community is animated by a spirit of freedom and charity; it is
characterized by mutual respect, sincere dialogue, and protection of the rights
of individuals. It assists each of its members to achieve wholeness as human
persons; in turn, everyone in the community helps in promoting unity, and each
one, according to his or her role and capacity, contributes towards decisions
which affect the community, and also towards maintaining and strengthening the
distinctive Catholic character of the Institution.</P>
<P>22. <I>University teachers </I>should seek to improve their competence and
endeavour to set the content, objectives, methods, and results of research in an
individual discipline within the framework of a coherent world vision.
Christians among the teachers are called to be witnesses and educators of
authentic Christian life, which evidences attained integration between faith and
life, and between professional competence and Christian wisdom. All teachers are
to be inspired by academic ideals and by the principles of an authentically
human life.</P>
<P><I>23. Students </I>are challenged to pursue an education that combines
excellence in humanistic and cultural development with specialized professional
training. Most especially, they are challenged to continue the search for truth
and for meaning throughout their lives, since &quot;the human spirit must be
cultivated in such a way that there results a growth in its ability to wonder,
to understand, to contemplate, to make personal judgments, and to develop a
religious, moral, and social sense&quot;(23).  This enables them to acquire or,
if they have already done so, to deepen a Christian way of life that is
authentic. They should realize the responsibility of their professional life,
the enthusiasm of being the trained 'leaders' of tomorrow, of being witnesses to
Christ in whatever place they may exercise their profession.</P>
<P>24. <I>Directors </I>and <I>administrators </I>in a Catholic University
promote the constant growth of the University and its community through a
leadership of service; the dedication and witness of the <I>non-academic staff
</I>are vital for the identity and life of the University.</P>
<P>25. Many Catholic Universities were founded by Religious Congregations, and
continue to depend on their support; those Religious Congregations dedicated to
the apostolate of higher education are urged to assist these Institutions in the
renewal of their commitment, and to continue to prepare religious men and women
who can positively contribute to the mission of a Catholic University.</P>
<P><I>Lay people </I>have found in university activities a means by which they
too could exercise an important apostolic role in the Church and, in most
Catholic Universities today, the academic community is largely composed of
laity; in increasing numbers, lay men and women are assuming important functions
and responsibilities for the direction of these Institutions. These lay
Catholics are responding to the Church's call &quot;to be present, as signs of
courage and intellectual creativity, in the privileged places of culture, that
is, the world of education-school and university&quot;(24). The future of
Catholic Universities depends to a great extent on the competent and dedicated
service of lay Catholics. The Church sees their developing presence in these
institutions both as a sign of hope and as a confirmation of the irreplaceable
lay vocation in the Church and in the world, confident that lay people will, in
the exercise of their own distinctive role, &quot;illumine and organize these
(temporal) affairs in such a way that they always start out, develop, and
continue according to Christ's mind, to the praise of the Creator and the
Redeemer&quot;(25).</P>
<P>26. The university community of many Catholic institutions includes members
of other Churches, ecclesial communities and religions, and also those who
profess no religious belief. These men and women offer their training and
experience in furthering the various academic disciplines or other university
tasks.</P>
<P><I><B>3. The Catholic University in the Church</B></I></P>
<P>27. Every Catholic University, without ceasing to be a University, has a
relationship to the Church that is essential to its institutional identity. As
such, it participates most directly in the life of the local Church in which it
is situated; at the same time, because it is an academic institution and
therefore a part of the international community of scholarship and inquiry, each
institution participates in and contributes to the life and the mission of the
universal Church, assuming consequently a special bond with the Holy See by
reason of the service to unity which it is called to render to the whole Church.
One consequence of its essential relationship to the Church is that the <I>institutional
</I>fidelity of the University to the Christian message includes a recognition
of and adherence to the teaching authority of the Church in matters of faith and
morals. Catholic members of the university community are also called to a
personal fidelity to the Church with all that this implies. Non-Catholic members
are required to respect the Catholic character of the University, while the
University in turn respects their religious liberty(26).</P>
<P>28. Bishops have a particular responsibility to promote Catholic
Universities, and especially to promote and assist in the preservation and
strengthening of their Catholic identity, including the protection of their
Catholic identity in relation to civil authorities. This will be achieved more
effectively if close personal and pastoral relationships exist between
University and Church authorities, characterized by mutual trust, close and
consistent cooperation and continuing dialogue. Even when they do not enter
directly into the internal governance of the University, Bishops &quot;should be
seen not as external agents but as participants in the life of the Catholic
University&quot;(27).</P>
<P>29. The Church, accepting &quot;the legitimate autonomy of human culture and
especially of the sciences&quot;, recognizes the academic freedom of scholars in
each discipline in accordance with its own principles and proper methods(28),
and within the confines of the truth and the common good.</P>
<P>Theology has its legitimate place in the University alongside other
disciplines. It has proper principles and methods which define it as a branch of
knowledge. Theologians enjoy this same freedom so long as they are faithful to
these principles and methods.</P>
<P>Bishops should encourage the creative work of theologians. They serve the
Church through research done in a way that respects theological method. They
seek to understand better, further develop and more effectively communicate the
meaning of Christian Revelation as transmitted in Scripture and Tradition and in
the Church's Magisterium. They also investigate the ways in which theology can
shed light on specific questions raised by contemporary culture. At the same
time, since theology seeks an understanding of revealed truth whose authentic
interpretation is entrusted to the Bishops of the Church(29),  it is intrinsic
to the principles and methods of their research and teaching in their academic
discipline that theologians respect the authority of the Bishops, and assent to
Catholic doctrine according to the degree of authority with which it is
taught(30).  Because of their interrelated roles, dialogue between Bishops and
theologians is essential; this is especially true today, when the results of
research are so quickly and so widely communicated through the media(31). </P>
<P><B>B. THE MISSION OF SERVICE OF A CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY</B></P>
<P>30. The basic mission of a University is a continuous quest for truth
through its research, and the preservation and communication of knowledge for
the good of society. A Catholic University participates in this mission with its
own specific characteristics and purposes.</P>
<P><I><B>1. Service to Church and Society</B></I></P>
<P>31. Through teaching and research, a Catholic University offers an
indispensable contribution to the Church. In fact, it prepares men and women
who, inspired by Christian principles and helped to live their Christian
vocation in a mature and responsible manner, will be able to assume positions of
responsibility in the Church. Moreover, by offering the results of its
scientific research, a Catholic University will be able to help the Church
respond to the problems and needs of this age.</P>
<P>32. A Catholic University, as any University, is immersed in human society;
as an extension of its service to the Church, and always within its proper
competence, it is called on to become an ever more effective instrument of
cultural progress for individuals as well as for society. Induded among its
research activities, therefore, will be a study of <I>serious contemporary
problems </I>in areas such as the dignity of human life, the promotion of
justice for all, the quality of personal and family life, the protection of
nature, the search for peace and political stability, a more just sharing in the
world's resources, and a new economic and political order that will better serve
the human community at a national and international level. University research
will seek to discover the roots and causes of the serious problems of our time,
paying special attention to their ethical and religious dimensions.</P>
<P>If need be, a Catholic University must have the courage to speak
uncomfortable truths which do not please public opinion, but which are necessary
to safeguard the authentic good of society.</P>
<P>33. A specific priority is the need to examine and evaluate the predominant
values and norms of modern society and culture in a Christian perspective, and
the responsibility to try to communicate to society those <I>ethical and
religious principles which give full meaning to human life. </I>In this way a
University can contribute further to the development of a true Christian
anthropology, founded on the person of Christ, which will bring the dynamism of
the creation and redemption to bear on reality and on the correct solution to
the problems of life.</P>
<P>34. The Christian spirit of service to others for the <I>promotion of
social justice </I>is of particular importance for each Catholic University, to
be shared by its teachers and developed in its students. The Church is firmly
committed to the integral growth of all men and women(32).  The Gospel,
interpreted in the social teachings of the Church, is an urgent call to promote
&quot;the development of those peoples who are striving to escape from hunger,
misery, endemic diseases and ignorance; of those who are looking for a wider
share in the benefits of civilization and a more active improvement of their
human qualities; of those who are aiming purposefully at their complete
fulfilment&quot;(33).  Every Catholic University feels responsible to contribute
concretely to the progress of the society within which it works: for example it
will be capable of searching for ways to make university education accessible to
all those who are able to benefit from it, especially the poor or members of
minority groups who customarily have been deprived of it. A Catholic University
also has the responsibility, to the degree that it is able, to help to promote
the development of the emerging nations.</P>
<P>35. In its attempts to resolve these complex issues that touch on so many
different dimensions of human life and of society, a Catholic University will
insist on cooperation among the different academic disciplines, each offering
its distinct contribution in the search for solutions; moreover, since the
economic and personal resources of a single Institution are limited, cooperation
in <I>common research projects </I>among Catholic Universities, as well as with
other private and governmental institutions, is imperative. In this regard, and
also in what pertains to the other fields of the specific activity of a Catholic
University, the role played by various national and international associations
of Catholic Universities is to be emphasized. Among these associations the
mission of <I>The International Federation of Catholic Universities, </I>founded
by the Holy See(34),  is particularly to be remembered. The Holy See anticipates
further fruitful collaboration with this Federation.</P>
<P>36. Through programmes of <I>continuing education </I>offered to the wider
community, by making its scholars available for consulting services, by taking
advantage of modern means of communication, and in a variety of other ways, a
Catholic University can assist in making the growing body of human knowledge and
a developing understanding of the faith available to a wider public, thus
expanding university services beyond its own academic community.</P>
<P>37. In its service to society, a Catholic University <I>will relate
especially to the academic, cultural and scientific world </I>of the region in
which it is located. Original forms of dialogue and collaboration are to be
encouraged between the Catholic Universities and the other Universities of a
nation on behalf of development, of understanding between cultures, and of the
defence of nature in accordance with an awareness of the international
ecological situation.</P>
<P>Catholic Universities join other private and public Institutions in serving
the public interest through higher education and research; they are one among
the variety of different types of institution that are necessary for the free
expression of cultural diversity, and they are committed to the promotion of
solidarity and its meaning in society and in the world. Therefore they have the
full right to expect that civil society and public authorities will recognize
and defend their institutional autonomy and academic freedom; moreover, they
have the right to the financial support that is necessary for their continued
existence and development.</P>
<P><I><B>2. Pastoral Ministry</B></I></P>
<P>38. Pastoral ministry is that activity of the University which offers the
members of the university community an opportunity to integrate religious and
moral principles with their academic study and non-academic activities, <I>thus
integrating faith with life. </I>It is part of the mission of the Church within
the University, and is also a constitutive element of a Catholic University
itself, both in its structure and in its life. A university community concerned
with promoting the Institution's Catholic character will be conscious of this
pastoral dimension and sensitive to the ways in which it can have an influence
on all university activities.</P>
<P>39. As a natural expression of the Catholic identity of the University, the
university community <I>should give a practical demonstration of its faith in
its daily activity, </I>with important moments of reflection and of prayer.
Catholic members of this community will be offered opportunities to assimilate
Catholic teaching and practice into their lives and will be encouraged to
participate in the celebration of the sacraments, especially the Eucharist as
the most perfect act of community worship. When the academic community includes
members of other Churches, ecclesial communities or religions, their initiatives
for reflection and prayer in accordance with their own beliefs are to be
respected.</P>
<P>40. Those involved in pastoral ministry will encourage teachers and students
to become more aware of their responsibility towards those who are suffering
physically or spiritually. Following the example of Christ, they will be
particularly attentive to the poorest and to those who suffer economic, social,
cultural or religious injustice. This responsibility begins within the academic
community, but it also finds application beyond it.</P>
<P>41. Pastoral ministry is an indispensable means by which Catholic students
can, in fulfilment of their baptism, <I>be prepared for active participation in
the life of the Church; </I>it can assist in developing and nurturing the value
of marriage and family life, fostering vocations to the priesthood and religious
life, stimulating the Christian commitment of the laity and imbuing every
activity with the spirit of the Gospel. Close cooperation between pastoral
ministry in a Catholic University and the other activities within the local
Church, under the guidance or with the approval of the diocesan Bishop, will
contribute to their mutual growth(35).</P>
<P>42. Various associations or movements of spiritual and apostolic life,
especially those developed specifically for students, can be of great assistance
in developing the pastoral aspects of university life.</P>
<P><I><B>3. Cultural Dialogue</B></I></P>
<P>43. By its very nature, a University develops culture through its research,
helps to transmit the local culture to each succeeding generation through its
teaching, and assists cultural activities through its educational services. It
is open to all human experience and is ready to dialogue with and learn from any
culture. A Catholic University shares in this, offering the rich experience of
the Church's own culture. In addition, a Catholic University, aware that human
culture is open to Revelation and transcendence, is also a primary and
privileged place for a <I>fruitful dialogue between the Gospel and culture.</I></P>
<P>44. Through this dialogue a Catholic University assists the Church, enabling
it to come to a better knowledge of diverse cultures, discern their positive and
negative aspects, to receive their authentically human contributions, and to
develop means by which it can make the faith better understood by the men and
women of a particular culture(36).  While it is true that the Gospel cannot be
identified with any particular culture and transcends all cultures, it is also
true that &quot;the Kingdom which the Gospel proclaims is lived by men and women
who are profoundly linked to a culture, and the building up of the Kingdom
cannot avoid borrowing the elements of human culture or cultures(37).  &quot;A
faith that places itself on the margin of what is human, of what is therefore
culture, would be a faith unfaithful to the fullness of what the Word of God
manifests and reveals, a decapitated faith, worse still, a faith in the process
of self-annihilation&quot;(38).</P>
<P>45. A Catholic University must become <I>more attentive to the cultures of
the world of today, </I>and to the <I>various cultural traditions existing
within the Church </I>in a way that will promote a continuous and profitable
dialogue between the Gospel and modern society. Among the criteria that
characterize the values of a culture are above all, the <I>meaning of the human
person, </I>his or her liberty, dignity, <I>sense of responsibility, </I>and
openness to the transcendent. To a respect for persons is joined <I>the
preeminent value of the family, </I>the primary unit of every human culture.</P>
<P>Catholic Universities will seek to discern and evaluate both the aspirations
and the contradictions of modern culture, in order to make it more suited to the
total development of individuals and peoples. In particular, it is recommended
that by means of appropriate studies, the impact of modern technology and
especially of the mass media on persons, the family, and the institutions and
whole of modem culture be studied deeply. Traditional cultures are to be
defended in their identity, helping them to receive modern values without
sacrificing their own heritage, which is a wealth for the whole of the human
family. Universities, situated within the ambience of these cultures, will seek
to harmonize local cultures with the positive contributions of modern cultures.</P>
<P>46. An area that particularly interests a Catholic University is the <I>dialogue
between Christian thought and the modern sciences. </I>This task requires
persons particularly well versed in the individual disciplines and who are at
the same time adequately prepared theologically, and who are capable of
confronting epistemological questions at the level of the relationship between
faith and reason. Such dialogue concerns the natural sciences as much as the
human sciences which posit new and complex philosophical and ethical problems.
The Christian researcher should demonstrate the way in which human intelligence
is enriched by the higher truth that comes from the Gospel: &quot;The
intelligence is never diminished, rather, it is stimulated and reinforced by
that interior fount of deep understanding that is the Word of God, and by the
hierarchy of values that results from it... In its unique manner, the Catholic
University helps to manifest the superiority of the spirit, that can never,
without the risk of losing its very self, be placed at the service of something
other than the search for truth&quot;(39). </P>
<P>47. Besides cultural dialogue, a Catholic University, in accordance vith its
specific ends, and keeping in mind the various religious-cultural contexts,
following the directives promulgated by competent ecclesiastical authority, can
offer a contribution to ecumenical dialogue. It does so to further the search
for unity among all Christians. In inter-religious dialogue it will assist in
discerning the spiritual values that are present in the different religions.</P>
<P><I><B>4. Evangelization</B></I></P>
<P>48. The primary mission of the Church is to preach the Gospel in such a way
that a relationship between faith and life is established in each individual and
in the socio-cultural context in which individuals live and act and communicate
with one another. Evangelization means &quot;bringing the Good News into all the
strata of humanity, and through its influence transforming humanity from within
and making it new... It is a question not only of preaching the Gospel in ever
wider geographic areas or to ever greater numbers of people, but also of
affecting and, as it were, upsetting, through the power of the Gospel,
humanity's criteria of judgment, determining values, points of interest, lines
of thought, sources of inspiration and models of life, which are in contrast
with the Word of God and the plan of salvation&quot;(40).</P>
<P>49. By its very nature, each Catholic University makes an important
contribution to the Church's work of evangelization. It is a living <I>institutional
</I>witness to Christ and his message, so vitally important in cultures marked
by secularism, or where Christ and his message are still virtually unknown.
Moreover, all the basic academic activities of a Catholic University are
connected with and in harmony with the evangelizing mission of the Church:
research carried out in the light of the Christian message which puts new human
discoveries at the service of individuals and society; education offered in a
faith-context that forms men and women capable of rational and critical judgment
and conscious of the transcendent dignity of the human person; professional
training that incorporates ethical values and a sense of service to individuals
and to society; the dialogue with culture that makes the faith better
understood, and the theological research that translates the faith into
contemporary language. &quot;Precisely because it is more and more conscious of
its salvific mission in this world, the Church wants to have these centres
closely connected with it; it wants to have them present and operative in
spreading the authentic message of Christ&quot;(41).</P>

<P><B>PART II</B></P></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<P><B>GENERAL NORMS</B></P></CENTER>
<P>Article 1. <I><B>The Nature of these General Norms</B></I></P>
<P>&#167; 1. These General Norms are based on, and are a further development
of, the Code of Canon Law(42) and the complementary Church legislation, without
prejudice to the right of the Holy See to intervene should this become
necessary. They are valid for all Catholic Universities and other Catholic
Institutes of Higher Studies throughout the world.</P>
<P>&#167; 2. The General Norms are to be applied concretely at the local and
regional levels by Episcopal Conferences and other Assemblies of Catholic
Hierarchy(43) in conformity with the Code of Canon Law and complementary Church
legislation, taking into account the Statutes of each University or Institute
and, as far as possible and appropriate, civil law. After review by the Holy
See(44),  these local or regional &quot;Ordinances&quot; will be valid for all
Catholic Universities and other Catholic Institutes of Higher Studies in the
region, except for Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties. These latter
Institutions, including Ecclesiastical Faculties which are part of a Catholic
University, are governed by the norms of the Apostolic Constitution <I>Sapientia
Christiana(45).</I></P>
<P>&#167; 3. A University established or approved by the Holy See, by an
Episcopal Conference or another Assembly of Catholic Hierarchy, or by a diocesan
Bishop is to incorporate these General Norms and their local and regional
applications into its governing documents, and conform its existing Statutes
both to the General Norms and to their applications, and submit them for
approval to the competent ecclesiastical Authority. It is contemplated that
other Catholic Universities, that is, those not established or approved in any
of the above ways, with the agreement of the local ecclesiastical Authority,
will make their own the General Norms and their local and regional applications,
internalizing them into their governing documents, and, as far as possible, will
conform their existing Statutes both to these General Norms and to their
applications.</P>
<P>Article 2. <I><B>The Nature of a Catholic University</B></I></P>
<P>&#167; 1. A Catholic University, like every university, is a community of
scholars representing various branches of human knowledge. It is dedicated to
research, to teaching, and to various kinds of service in accordance with its
cultural mission.</P>
<P>&#167; 2. A Catholic University, as Catholic, informs and carries out its
research, teaching, and all other activities with Catholic ideals, principles
and attitudes. It is linked with the Church either by a formal, constitutive and
statutory bond or by reason of an institutional commitment made by those
responsible for it.</P>
<P>&#167; 3. Every Catholic University is to make known its Catholic identity,
either in a mission statement or in some other appropriate public document,
unless authorized otherwise by the competent ecclesiastical Authority. The
University, particularly through its structure and its regulations, is to
provide means which will guarantee the expression and the preservation of this
identity in a manner consistent with &#167;2.</P>
<P>&#167; 4. Catholic teaching and discipline are to influence all university
activities, while the freedom of conscience of each person is to be fully
respected(46). Any official action or commitment of the University is to be in
accord with its Catholic identity.</P>
<P>&#167; 5. A Catholic University possesses the autonomy necessary to develop
its distinctive identity and pursue its proper mission. Freedom in research and
teaching is recognized and respected according to the principles and methods of
each individual discipline, so long as the rights of the individual and of the
community are preserved within the confines of the truth and the common
good(47).</P>
<P>Article 3. <I><B>The Establishment of a Catholic University</B></I></P>
<P>&#167; 1. A Catholic University may be established or approved by the Holy
See, by an Episcopal Conference or another Assembly of Catholic Hierarchy, or by
a diocesan Bishop.</P>
<P>&#167; 2. With the consent of the diocesan Bishop, a Catholic University may
also be established by a Religious Institute or other public juridical person.</P>
<P>&#167; 3. A Catholic University may also be established by other
ecclesiastical or lay persons; such a University may refer to itself as a
Catholic University only with the consent of the competent ecclesiastical
Authority, in accordance with the conditions upon which both parties shall
agree(48).</P>
<P>&#167; 4. In the cases of &#167;&#167; 1 and 2, the Statutes must be
approved by the competent ecclesiastical Authority.</P>
<P>Article 4. <I><B>The University Community</B></I></P>
<P>&#167; 1. The responsibility for maintaining and strengthening the Catholic
identity of the University rests primarily with the University itself. While
this responsibility is entrusted principally to university authorities
(including, when the positions exist, the Chancellor and/or a Board of Trustees
or equivalent body), it is shared in varying degrees by all members of the
university community, and therefore calls for the recruitment of adequate
university personnel, especially teachers and administrators, who are both
willing and able to promote that identity. The identity of a Catholic University
is essentially linked to the quality of its teachers and to respect for Catholic
doctrine. It is the responsibility of the competent Authority to watch over
these two fundamental needs in accordance with what is indicated in Canon
Law(49).</P>
<P>&#167; 2. All teachers and all administrators, at the time of their
appointment, are to be informed about the Catholic identity of the Institution
and its implications, and about their responsibility to promote, or at least to
respect, that identity.</P>
<P>&#167; 3. In ways appropriate to the different academic disciplines, all
Catholic teachers are to be faithful to, and all other teachers are to respect,
Catholic doctrine and morals in their research and teaching. In particular,
Catholic theologians, aware that they fulfil a mandate received from the Church,
are to be faithful to the Magisterium of the Church as the authentic interpreter
of Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition(50).</P>
<P>&#167; 4. Those university teachers and administrators who belong to other
Churches, ecclesial communities, or religions, as well as those who profess no
religious belief, and also all students, are to recognize and respect the
distinctive Catholic identity of the University. In order not to endanger the
Catholic identity of the University or Institute of Higher Studies, the number
of non-Catholic teachers should not be allowed to constitute a majority within
the Institution, which is and must remain Catholic.</P>
<P>&#167; 5. The education of students is to combine academic and professional
development with formation in moral and religious principles and the social
teachings of the Church; the programme of studies for each of the various
professions is to include an appropriate ethical formation in that profession.
Courses in Catholic doctrine are to be made available to all students(51).</P>
<P>Article 5. <I><B>The Catholic University within the Church</B></I></P>
<P>&#167; 1. Every Catholic University is to maintain communion with the
universal Church and the Holy See; it is to be in close communion with the local
Church and in particular with the diocesan Bishops of the region or nation in
which it is located. In ways consistent with its nature as a University, a
Catholic University will contribute to the Church's work of evangelization.</P>
<P>&#167; 2. Each Bishop has a responsibility to promote the welfare of the
Catholic Universities in his diocese and has the right and duty to watch over
the preservation and strengthening of their Catholic character. If problems
should arise conceming this Catholic character, the local Bishop is to take the
initiatives necessary to resolve the matter, working with the competent
university authorities in accordance with established procedures(52) and, if
necessary, with the help of the Holy See.</P>
<P>&#167; 3. Periodically, each Catholic University, to which Artide 3,  1 and
2 refers, is to communicate relevant information about the University and its
activities to the competent ecclesiastical Authority. Other Catholic
Universities are to communicate this information to the Bishop of the diocese in
which the principal seat of the Institution is located.</P>
<P>Article 6. <I><B>Pastoral Ministry</B></I></P>
<P>&#167; 1. A Catholic University is to promote the pastoral care of all
members of the university community, and to be especially attentive to the
spiritual development of those who are Catholics. Priority is to be given to
those means which will facilitate the integration of human and professional
education with religious values in the light of Catholic doctrine, in order to
unite intellectual learning with the religious dimension of life.</P>
<P>&#167; 2. A sufficient number of qualified people-priests, religious, and
lay persons-are to be appointed to provide pastoral ministry for the university
community, carried on in harmony and cooperation with the pastoral activities of
the local Church under the guidance or with the approval of the diocesan Bishop.
All members of the university community are to be invited to assist the work of
pastoral ministry, and to collaborate in its activities.</P>
<P>Article 7. <I><B>Cooperation</B></I></P>
<P>&#167; 1. In order better to confront the complex problems facing modern
society, and in order to strengthen the Catholic identity of the Institutions,
regional, national and international cooperation is to be promoted in research,
teaching, and other university activities among all Catholic Universities,
induding Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties(53).  Such cooperation is
also to be promoted between Catholic Universities and other Universities, and
with other research and educational Institutions, both private and governmental.</P>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<FONT size=3>
<P>&#167; 2. Catholic Universities will, when possible and in accord with
Catholic principles and doctrine, cooperate with government programmes and the
programmes of other national and international Organizations on behalf of
justice, development and progress.</P>
<CENTER>
<P><B>TRANSITIONAL NORMS</B></P></CENTER>
<P>Art. 8. The present Constitution will come into effect on the first day to
the academic year 1991.</P>
<P>Art. 9. The application of the Constitution is committed to the Congregation
for Catholic Education, which has the duty to promulgate the necessary
directives that will serve towards that end.</P>
<P>Art. 10. It will be the competence of the Congregation for Catholic
Education, when with the passage of time circumstances require it, to propose
changes to be made in the present Constitution in order that it may be adapted
continuously to the needs of Catholic Universities.</P>
<P>Art. 11. Any particular laws or customs presently in effect that are
contrary to this Constitution are abolished. Also, any privileges granted up to
this day by the Holy See whether to physical or moral persons that are contrary
to this present Constitution are abolished.</P>
<CENTER>
<P><B>CONCLUSION</B></P></CENTER>
<P>The mission that the Church, with great hope, entrusts to Catholic
Universities holds a cultural and religious meaning of vital importance because
it concerns the very future of humanity. The renewal requested of Catholic
Universities will make them better able to respond to the task of bringing the
message of Christ to man, to society, to the various cultures: &quot;Every human
reality, both individual and social has been liberated by Christ: persons, as
well as the activities of men and women, of which culture is the highest and
incarnate expression. The salvific action of the Church on cultures is achieved,
first of all, by means of persons, families and educators... Jesus Christ, our
Saviour, offers his light and his hope to all those who promote the sciences,
the arts, letters and the numerous fields developed by modem culture. Therefore,
all the sons and daughters of the Church should become aware of their mission
and discover how the strength of the Gospel can penetrate and regenerate the
mentalities and dominant values that inspire individual cultures, as well as the
opinions and mental attitudes that are derived from it&quot;(54).</P>
<P>It is with fervent hope that I address this Document to all the men and
women engaged in various ways in the significant mission of Catholic higher
education.</P>
<P>Beloved Brothers and Sisters, my encouragement and my trust go with you in
your weighty daily task that becomes ever more important, more urgent and
necessary on behalf of Evangelization for the future of culture and of all
cultures. The Church and the world have great need of your witness and of your
capable, free, and responsible contribution.</P>

institution is and remains internal to the institution; &quot;academic freedom&quot;
is the guarantee given to those involved in teaching and research that, within
their specific specialized branch of knowledge, and according to the methods
proper to that specific area, they may search for the truth wherever analysis
and evidence leads them, and may teach and publish the results of this search,
keeping in mind the cited criteria, that is, safeguarding the rights of the
individual and of society within the confines of the truth and the common good.</P>
<P>16 There is a two-fold notion of <I>culture </I>used in this document: the
<I>humanistic </I>and the <I>socio-historical. </I>&quot;The word 'culture' in
its general sense indicates all those factors by which man refines and unfolds
his manifold spiritual and bodily qualities. It means his effort to bring the
world itself under his control by his knowledge and his labor. It includes the
fact that by improving customs and institutions he renders social life more
human both within the family and in the civic community. Finally, it is a
feature of culture that throughout the course of time man expresses,
communicates, and conserves in his works great spiritual experiences and
desires, so that these may be of advantage to the progress of many, even of the
whole human family. Hence it follows that human culture necessarily has a
historical and social aspect and that the word 'culture' often takes on a
sociological and ethnological sense&quot;. VATICAN COUNCIL II, Pastoral

<P>34 &quot;Therefore, in that there has been a pleasing multiplication of
centres of higher learning, it has become apparent that it would be opportune
for the faculty and the alumni to unite in common association which, working in
reciprocal understanding and close collaboration, and based upon the authority
of the Supreme Pontiff, as father and universal doctor, they might more
efficaciously spread and extend the light of Christ&quot;. (Plus XII, Apostolic
Letter <I>Catholicas Studiorum Universitates, </I>with which The International
Federation of Catholic Universities was established: AAS 42 [1950], p. 386).</P>
<P>35 The Code of Canon Law indicates the general responsibility of the Bishop
toward university students: &quot;The diocesan bishop is to have serious
pastoral concern for students by erecting a parish for them or by assigning
priests for this purpose on a stable basis; he is also to provide for Catholic
university centers at universities, even non-Catholic ones, to give assistance,
especially spiritual to young people&quot;. <I>(CIC, </I>can. 813).</P>
<P>36 &quot;Living in various circumstances during the course of time, the
Church, too, has used in her preaching the discoveries of different cultures to
spread and explain the message of Christ to all nations, to probe it and more
deeply understand it, and to give it better expression in liturgical
celebrations and in the life of the diversified community of the faithful&quot;.

<P>48 Both the establishment of such a university and the conditions by which
it may refer to itself as a Catholic University are to be in accordance with the
prescriptions issued by the Holy See, Episcopal Conference or other Assembly of
Catholic Hierarchy.</P>
<P>49 Canon 810 of CIC, specifies the responsibility of the competent
Authorities in this area: &#167; 1 &quot;It is the responsibility of the
authority who is competent in accord with the statutes to provide for the
appointment of teachers to Catholic universities who, besides their scientific
and pedagogical suitability, are also outstanding in their integrity of doctrine
and probity of life; when those requisite qualities are lacking they are to be
removed from their positions in accord with the procedure set forth in the
statutes. &#167; 2 The conference of bishops and the diocesan bishops concerned
have the duty and right of being vigilant that in these universities the
principles of Catholic doctrine are faithfully observed&quot;. Cf. also Article
5, 2 ahead in these &quot;Norms&quot;.</P>

higher studies have a mandate from the competent ecclesiastical authority&quot;.</P>

<P>52 For Universities to which Article 3 &#167;&#167; 1 and 2 refer, these
procedures are to be established in the university statutes approved by the
competent ecclesiastical Authority; for other Catholic Universities, they are to
be determined by Episcopal Conferences or other Assemblies of Catholic
Hierarchy.</P>
