<p><strong><strong>SECTION COMMENTARY:</strong>  </strong></p>
 <strong>	In this selection of arguments we see Aquinas defending three main 
claims. [1] Every human being desires happiness defined as perfect goodness, 
even though human beings differ upon WHAT they identify as perfect goodness. 
 [2] Human happiness is divisible into perfect and imperfect. Perfect happiness 
is impossible in this life because human nature is not satisfied until the 
essence of God is directly known. Imperfect happiness is possible in this 
life and it requires many things that are not required for perfect happiness. 
 [3] The imperfect happiness of this life consists in virtuous acts as identified
by Aristotle. These claims presuppose a philosophy of person that characterizes
human beings as hylomorphic beings that are primarily rational.   </strong><br>

</b>  
<p><b><strong>SUMMARY (I-II.2.4c): THE INADEQUACIES OF POWER, FAME, RESPECT
AND WEALTH FOR HAPPINESS</strong></b>	   </p>
 
<p><b>Four general reasons may be given to prove that happiness consists
in none of the foregoing external goods, namely, power, fame, respect and
wealth. <em>First,</em><strong>because</strong>, <strong>since</strong> happiness 
is man's supreme good, it is incompatible with any evil. Now all the foregoing 
can be found both in good and in evil men. <em>Secondly,</em><strong>because</strong>, 
<strong>since</strong> it is the nature of happiness to "satisfy of itself," 
as stated in Ethic. i, 7, having gained happiness, man cannot lack any needful 
good. But after acquiring any one of the foregoing, man may still lack many 
goods that are necessary to him; <strong>for</strong> instance, wisdom, bodily 
health, and such like. <em>Thirdly,</em> <strong>because</strong>, <strong>since</strong> 
happiness is <strong><em>THE perfect Good</em></strong>, no evil can accrue 
to anyone therefrom. This cannot be said of the foregoing: <strong>for</strong> 
it is written (Eccles. 5:12) that "riches" are sometimes "kept to the hurt 
of the owner"; and the same may be said of the other three. <em>Fourthly,</em> 
<strong>because</strong> man is ordained to happiness through principles that
are in him; <strong>since</strong> he is ordained thereto naturally. Now
the four goods mentioned above are due rather to external causes, and in
most cases to fortune; <strong>for</strong> which reason they are called
 goods of fortune. <strong>Therefore</strong> it is evident that happiness 
nowise consists in the foregoing.  </b>  <br wp="br1">

  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.2.7: WHETHER SOME GOOD OF THE SOUL CONSTITUTES HAPPINESS?</strong>
  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	OBJ 3: Further, perfection is something belonging to that which 
is perfected. But happiness is a perfection of man. <strong>Therefore</strong> 
happiness is something belonging to man. But it is not something belonging
 to the body, as shown above (A5). <strong>Therefore</strong> it is something 
belonging to the soul; and <strong>thus</strong> it consists in goods of the
soul.  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, As stated above (Q1, A8), the 
end is twofold: namely, <em>the thing itself</em>, which we desire to attain, 
and the use, namely, <em>the attainment or possession</em> of that thing. 
If, then, we speak of man's last end, it is impossible for man's last end 
to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. <strong>Because</strong> 
the soul [is always present to the self while happiness is not so present]. 
<strong>Therefore</strong> the soul itself cannot be its own last end.  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	In like manner neither can anything belonging to the soul whether 
a power, habit, or act. <strong>For</strong> that good which is the last end,
is <strong><em>THE perfect Good</em></strong> fulfilling the desire. Now
man's appetite, otherwise the will, is for the universal good. And any good
inherent to the soul is a [particular] good. <strong>Therefore</strong> none
of them can be man's last end.  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	But if we speak of man's last end, as to <em>the attainment or 
possession</em> thereof, or as to any use whatever of <em>the thing itself</em> 
desired as an end, <strong>thus</strong> does something of man, in respect 
of his soul, belong to his last end: <strong>since</strong> man attains happiness 
through his soul. <strong>Therefore</strong> <em>the thing itself</em> which 
is desired as end, is that which constitutes happiness, and makes man happy; 
but <em>the attainment</em> of this thing is called happiness. <strong>Consequently</strong> 
we must say that happiness is something belonging to the soul; but that which
 constitutes happiness is something outside the soul.  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	Reply OBJ 3: Happiness, itself, <strong>since</strong> it is a
perfection of the soul, is an inherent good of the soul; but that which constitutes
happiness, viz. which makes man happy, is something outside his soul, as
stated above.  <br wp="br1">

  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.2.8: WHETHER ANY CREATED GOOD CONSTITUTES MAN'S HAPPINESS?</strong>
  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong></p>
  
<p><strong>	<strong>ON THE CONTRARY</strong>, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei 
xix, 26): "As the soul is the life of the body, so God is man's life of happiness: 
of Whom it is written: 'Happy is that people whose God is the Lord' (Ps. 143:15)."
   </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<big><strong>I answer that</strong>, </big>It is impossible for
any created good to constitute man's happiness. <strong>For</strong> happiness
is <strong><em>THE perfect Good</em></strong>, which lulls the appetite altogether;
else it would not be the last end, if something yet remained to be desired.
Now the object of the will, i.e. of man's appetite, is the universal good;
just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. <strong>Hence</strong> 
it is evident that naught can lull man's will, save the universal good. This 
is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone; <strong>because</strong> 
every creature has goodness by participation. <strong>therefore</strong> God
alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Ps. 102:5: "Who
satisfieth thy desire with good things." <strong>Therefore</strong> God alone
constitutes man's happiness.  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong></p>
  
<p><br>
   </p>
 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.3.8: WHETHER HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN THE VISION OF THE
DIVINE ESSENCE?</strong>  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<strong>I answer that</strong>, Final and <strong><em>perfect</em></strong> 
happiness can consist in nothing else than the vision of the Divine Essence. 
To make this clear, two points must be observed. <em>First,</em> man is not 
perfectly happy, so long as something remains for him to desire and seek: 
<em>secondly,</em> that the perfection of any power is determined by the nature
of its object. Now the object of the intellect is "what a thing is," i.e.
the essence of a thing, according to De Anima iii, 6. <strong>therefore</strong> 
the intellect attains perfection, in so far as it knows the essence of a
thing. If <strong>therefore</strong> an intellect knows the essence of some
effect, whereby it is not possible to know the essence of the cause, i.e.
to know of the cause "what it is"; that intellect cannot be said to reach
that cause  simply, although it may be able to gather from the effect the
knowledge of that the cause is. <strong>Consequently</strong>, when man knows
an effect, and knows that it has a cause, there naturally remains in the
man the desire to know about the cause, "what it is." And this desire is
one of wonder, and causes inquiry, as is stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics
(i, 2). <strong>For</strong> instance, if a man, knowing the eclipse of the
sun, consider that it must be due to some cause, and know not what that cause 
is, he wonders about it, and from wondering proceeds to inquire. Nor does 
this inquiry cease until he arrive at a knowledge of the essence of the cause.
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	If <strong>therefore</strong> the human intellect, knowing the 
essence of some created effect, knows no more of God than "that He is"; the 
perfection of that intellect does not yet reach simply the First Cause, but 
there remains in it the natural desire to seek the cause. <strong>therefore</strong> 
it is not yet perfectly happy. <strong>Consequently</strong>, <strong>for</strong>
 <strong><em>perfect</em></strong> happiness the intellect needs to reach 
the very Essence of the First Cause. And <strong>thus</strong> it will have 
its perfection through union with God as with that object, in which alone 
man's happiness consists, as stated above (AA1,7; Q2, A8).  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong> <br>
  </p>
 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.5.8: WHETHER EVERY PERSON DESIRES HAPPINESS?</strong>
    </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	OBJ 1: It would seem that not all desire Happiness. <strong>for</strong> 
no man can desire what he knows not; <strong>since</strong> the apprehended 
good is the object of the appetite (De Anima iii, 10). But many know not what
Happiness is. This is evident from the fact that, as Augustine says (De Trin.
xiii, 4), "some thought that Happiness consists in pleasures of the body;
some, in a virtue of the soul; some in other things." <strong>Therefore</strong>
 not all desire Happiness.    </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<big><strong>I answer that</strong>, </big>Happiness can be considered
in two ways. First according to the general notion of happiness: and <strong>thus</strong>, 
of necessity, every man desires happiness. <strong>For</strong> the general 
notion of happiness consists in <strong><em>THE perfect Good</em></strong>, 
as stated above (AA3,4). But <strong>since</strong> good is the object of 
the will, <strong><em>THE perfect Good</em></strong> of a man is that which 
entirely satisfies his will. <strong>Consequently</strong> to desire happiness 
is nothing else than to desire that one's will be satisfied. And this everyone 
desires. Secondly we may speak of Happiness according to its specific notion, 
as to that in which it consists. And <strong>thus</strong> all do not know
 Happiness; <strong>because</strong> they know not in what thing the general 
notion of happiness is found. And <strong>consequently</strong>, in this respect,
not all desire it. <strong>therefore</strong> the reply to the first Objection
is clear.  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">

    <strong><br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong> 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.4.5: WHETHER THE BODY IS NECESSARY for HUMAN HAPPINESS?</strong>
  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	OBJ 5: Further, Happiness is the sufficient good and lulls desire. 
But this cannot be said of the separated soul; <strong>for</strong> it yet 
desires to be united to the body, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35).
 <strong>Therefore</strong> the soul is not happy while separated from the 
body.    </strong></p>
  
<p><strong>	<big><strong>I answer that</strong>, </big>Happiness is twofold;
the one is <strong><em>imperfect</em></strong> and is had in this life; the
other is <strong><em>perfect</em></strong>, consisting in the vision of God.
Now it is evident that the body is necessary for the happiness of this life. 
<strong>For</strong> the happiness of this life consists in an operation of
the intellect, either speculative or practical. And the operation of the intellect
in this life cannot be without a <em>sense image</em>, which is only in a
bodily organ, as was shown in the FP, Q84, AA6,7. <strong>Consequently</strong> 
that happiness which can be had in this life, depends, in a way, on the body. 
But as to <strong><em>perfect</em></strong> Happiness, which consists in the
vision of God,  it is evident that the Divine Essence cannot be seen by means
of sense images, as stated in the FP, Q12, A3. <strong>therefore</strong>, 
<strong>since</strong> man's <strong><em>perfect</em></strong> Happiness consists
in the vision of the Divine Essence, it does not depend on the body. <strong>Consequently</strong>,
without the body the soul can be happy.  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	We must, however, notice that something may belong to a thing's 
perfection in <em>two</em> ways. <em>First</em>, as constituting the essence 
thereof; <strong>thus</strong> the soul is necessary for man's perfection. 
<em>Secondly</em>, as necessary for its well-being: <strong>thus</strong>, 
beauty of body and keenness of perfection belong to man's perfection. <strong>therefore</strong>
 though the body does not belong in the first way to the perfection of human 
Happiness, yet it does in the second way. <strong>For</strong> <strong>since</strong> 
operation depends on a thing's nature, the more <strong><em>perfect</em></strong> 
is the soul in its nature, the more perfectly it has its proper operation, 
wherein its happiness consists.    </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	Reply OBJ 5: The desire of the separated soul is entirely at rest,
as regards the thing desired; <strong>since</strong>, to wit, it has that
which suffices its appetite. But it is not wholly at rest, as regards the
desirer, <strong>since</strong> it does not possess that good in every way
that it would wish to possess it. <strong>Consequently</strong>, after the
body has been resumed, Happiness increases not in intensity, but in extent.
    </strong></p>
 
<p><br>
   </p>
  
<p><strong><strong>I-II.4.7: WHETHER ANY EXTERNAL GOODS ARE NECESSARY for 
HAPPINESS?</strong>  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  <big><strong>I answer that</strong>,</big> <strong>for</strong> <em><strong>imperfect</strong> 
happiness</em>, such as can be had in this life, external goods are necessary, 
not as belonging to the <em>essence</em> of happiness, but by serving as <em>instruments</em>
to happiness, which consists in an operation of virtue, as stated in Ethic.
i, 13. <strong>for</strong> man needs in this life, the necessaries of the
body, both for the operation of contemplative virtue, and for the operation
of active virtue, for which latter he needs also many other things by means
of which to perform its operations.  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<em>On the other hand,</em> such goods as these are nowise necessary 
for <em><strong>perfect</strong> Happiness</em>, which consists in seeing 
God. <strong>The reason of this</strong> is that all such like external goods 
are requisite either for the support of the animal body; or for certain operations 
which belong to human life, which we perform by means of the animal body: 
whereas that <em><strong>perfect</strong> Happiness</em> which consists in 
seeing God, will be either in the soul separated from the body, or in the 
soul united to the body then no longer animal but spiritual. <strong>Consequently</strong> 
these external goods are nowise necessary for <em>that</em> Happiness, <strong>since</strong> 
they are ordained to the animal life. And <strong>since</strong>, in this 
life, the felicity of contemplation, as being more Godlike, approaches nearer
 than that of action to the likeness of that <em><strong>perfect</strong> 
Happiness,</em> <strong>therefore</strong> it stands in less need of these 
goods of the body as stated in Ethic. x, 8.  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </strong></p>
 <br>
<br>
 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.4.8: WHETHER THE FELLOWSHIP OF FRIENDS IS NECESSARY 
for HAPPINESS?</strong>    </strong></p>
  
<p><strong>	<strong>ON THE CONTRARY</strong>, It is written (Wis. 7:11): "All
good things came to me together with her," i.e. with divine wisdom, which
consists in contemplating God. <strong>Consequently</strong> nothing else
is necessary for Happiness.    </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<big><strong>I answer that</strong>,</big> If we speak of <em>the
happiness of this life</em>, the happy man needs friends, as the Philosopher
says (Ethic. ix, 9), not, indeed, to make use of them, <strong>since</strong>
he suffices himself; nor to delight in them, <strong>since</strong> he possesses
<strong><em>perfect</em></strong> delight in the operation of virtue; but
for the purpose of a good operation,  viz. that he may do good to them; that
he may delight in seeing them do good; and again that he may be helped by
them in his good work. <strong>For</strong> in order that man may do well,
whether in the works of the active life, or in those of the contemplative
life, he needs the fellowship of friends.  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	But if we speak of <em><strong>perfect</strong> Happiness which 
will be in our heavenly Fatherland, </em>the fellowship of friends is not 
essential to Happiness; <strong>since</strong> man has the entire fulness 
of his perfection in God. But the fellowship of friends conduces to the <em>well-being</em> 
of Happiness.     </strong></p>
 
<p><strong><br wp="br1">
 <br>
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.5.2: WHETHER ONE CAN BE HAPPIER THAN ANOTHER?</strong>
 </strong>   </p>
 
<p><strong><big><strong>I answer that</strong>,</big> As stated above (Q1,
A8; Q2, A7), Happiness implies two things, to wit, the last end itself, i.e.
the Sovereign Good; and the attainment or enjoyment of that same Good. As
to that Good itself, Which is the object and cause of Happiness, one Happiness
cannot be greater than another, <strong>since</strong> there is but one Sovereign 
Good, namely, God, by enjoying Whom, men are made happy. But as to the attainment 
or enjoyment of this Good, one man can be happier than another; <strong>because</strong> 
the more a man enjoys this Good the happier he is. Now, that one man enjoys 
God more than another, happens through his being better disposed or ordered 
to the enjoyment of Him. And in this sense one man can be happier than another.
  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
 </strong> <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
   </p>
 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.5.3: WHETHER ONE CAN BE HAPPY IN THIS LIFE?</strong>
 </strong>   </p>
 
<p><strong><strong>I answer that</strong>, A certain participation of Happiness 
can be had in this life: but <strong><em>perfect</em></strong> and true Happiness
 cannot be had in this life. This may be seen from a twofold consideration.
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<em>First,</em> from the general notion of happiness. <strong>For</strong> 
<strong>since</strong> happiness is a "perfect and sufficient good," it excludes 
every evil, and fulfils every desire. But in this life every evil cannot be
excluded. <strong>For</strong> this present life is subject to many unavoidable 
evils; to ignorance on the part of the intellect; to inordinate affection 
on the part of the appetite, and to many penalties on the part of the body; 
as Augustine sets forth in De Civ. Dei xix, 4. Likewise neither can the desire 
for good be satiated in this life. <strong>For</strong> man naturally desires 
the good, which he has, to be abiding. Now the goods of the present life pass
away; <strong>since</strong> life itself passes away, which we naturally desire
to have, and would wish to hold abidingly, <strong>for</strong> man naturally
shrinks from death. <strong>therefore</strong> it is impossible to have true
Happiness in this life.  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<em>Secondly,</em> from a consideration of the specific nature 
of Happiness, viz. the vision of the Divine Essence, which man cannot obtain 
in this life, as was shown in the FP, Q12, A11. <strong>Hence</strong> it 
is evident that none can attain true and <strong><em>perfect</em></strong> 
Happiness in this life.   </strong></p>
<p><strong><br wp="br2">
    </strong></p>
 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.5.5: WHETHER ONE CAN ATTAIN HAPPINESS BY HIS NATURAL 
POWERS?</strong>    </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<big><strong>I answer that</strong>,</big> <em><strong>imperfect</strong> 
happiness</em> that can be had in this life, can be acquired by man by his
 natural powers, in the same way as virtue, in whose operation it consists: 
on this point we shall speak further on (Q63). But man's <em><strong>perfect</strong> 
Happiness</em>, as stated above (Q3, A8), consists in the vision of the Divine 
Essence. Now the vision of God's Essence surpasses the nature not only of 
man, but also of every creature, as was shown in the FP, Q12, A4. <strong>For</strong> 
the natural knowledge of every creature is in keeping with the mode of his 
substance: <strong>thus</strong> it is said of the intelligence (De Causis; 
Prop. viii) that "it knows things that are above it, and things that are below
it, according to the mode of its substance." But every knowledge that is
according to the mode of created substance, falls short of the vision of
the Divine Essence, which infinitely surpasses all created substance. <strong>Consequently</strong>
neither man, nor any creature, can attain final  Happiness by his natural
powers.  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
 </strong> <br wp="br1">
   </p>
 
<p><strong><strong>I-II.5.1: WHETHER [PERFECT HAPPINESS IS MERELY A DREAM?]</strong>
  <br wp="br1">
 <br>
  </strong></p>
 
<p><strong>	<big><strong>I answer that</strong>,</big> Happiness is the attainment
of <strong><em>THE perfect Good</em></strong>. Whoever, <strong>therefore</strong>, 
is capable of <strong><em>THE perfect Good</em></strong> can attain Happiness. 
Now, that man is capable of <strong><em>THE perfect Good</em></strong>, is 
proved both <strong>because</strong> his intellect can apprehend the universal 
and <strong><em>perfect</em></strong> good, and <strong>because</strong> his
will can desire it. And <strong>therefore</strong> man can attain Happiness. 
This can be proved again from the fact that man is capable of seeing God, 
as stated in FP, Q12, A1: in which vision, as we stated above (Q3, A8) man's 
<strong><em>perfect</em></strong> Happiness consists.  <br wp="br1">
