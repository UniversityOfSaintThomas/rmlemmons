<a NAME="start"></a><a NAME="10"></a>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<a NAME="11"></a>

<p>With these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the discu
ssion;&nbsp;<a NAME="12"></a>but
the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For Glaucon, who&nbsp;<a NAME="13"></a>is
always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus'&nbsp;<a NAME="14"></a>retirement;
he wanted to have the battle out. So he said to me: Socrates,&nbsp;<a NAME="15"></a>do
you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded us,&nbsp;<a NAME="16"></a>that
to be just is always better than to be unjust?&nbsp;<a NAME="17"></a>

<p>I should wish reall
y to persuade you, I replied, if I&nbsp;<a NAME="18"></a>could.&nbsp;<a NAME="19"></a>
<br>Then you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now: --How would&nbsp;<a NAME="20"></a>you
arrange goods --are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes,&nbsp;<a NAME="21"></a>and
independently of their consequences, as, for example, harmless pleasures&nbsp;<a NAME="22"></a>and
enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although nothing follows&nbsp;<a NAME="23"></a>from
them?&nbsp;<a NAME="24"></a>

<p>I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I&nbsp;<a NAME="25"></a>replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="26"></a>
<br>Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,&nbsp;<a NAME="27"></a>health,
which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their&nbsp;<a NAME="28"></a>results?&nbsp;<a NAME="29"></a>

<p>Certainly, I said.&nbsp;<a NAME="30"></a>
<br>And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the&nbsp;<a NAME="31"></a>care
of the sick, and the physic
ian's art; also the various ways of money-making&nbsp;<a NAME="32"></a>--these
do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and no one would&nbsp;<a NAME="33"></a>choose
them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of some reward or&nbsp;<a NAME="34"></a>result
which flows from them?&nbsp;<a NAME="35"></a>

<p>There is, I said, this third class also. But why do you&nbsp;<a NAME="36"></a>ask?&nbsp;<a NAME="37"></a>
<br>Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place&nbsp;<a NA ME="38"></a>justice?&nbsp;<a NAME="39"></a>

<p>In the highest class, I replied, --among those goods which he who&nbsp;<a NAME="40"></a>would
be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their&nbsp;<a NAME="41"></a>results.&nbsp;<a NAME="42"></a>

<p>Then the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to&nbsp;<a NAME="43"></a>be
reckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued&nbsp;<a NAME="44"></a>for
the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in thems
elves are disagreeable&nbsp;<a NAME="45"></a>and
rather to be avoided.&nbsp;<a NAME="46"></a>

<p>I know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that&nbsp;<a NAME="47"></a>this
was the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he&nbsp;<a NAME="48"></a>censured
justice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be convinced&nbsp;<a NAME="49"></a>by
him.&nbsp;<a NAME="50"></a>

<p>I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then&nbsp;<a NAME="51"></a>I
sh
all see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like&nbsp;<a NAME="52"></a>a
snake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have&nbsp;<a NAME="53"></a>been;
but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been&nbsp;<a NAME="54"></a>made
clear. Setting aside their rewards and results, I want to know what&nbsp;<a NAME="55"></a>they
are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the soul. If you,&nbsp;<a NAME="56"></a>please,
then, I will revive the argu
ment of Thrasymachus. And first I will&nbsp;<a NAME="57"></a>speak
of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view&nbsp;<a NAME="58"></a>of
them. Secondly, I will show that all men who practise justice do so&nbsp;<a NAME="59"></a>against
their will, of necessity, but not as a good. And thirdly, I will&nbsp;<a NAME="60"></a>argue
that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust is&nbsp;<a NAME="61"></a>after
all better far than the life of the just --if what they say is tru
e,&nbsp;<a NAME="62"></a>Socrates,
since I myself am not of their opinion. But still I acknowledge&nbsp;<a NAME="63"></a>that
I am perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads&nbsp;<a NAME="64"></a>of
others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have never yet&nbsp;<a NAME="65"></a>heard
the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in&nbsp;<a NAME="66"></a>a
satisfactory way. I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself;&nbsp;<a NAME="67"></a>then
I shal
l be satisfied, and you are the person from whom I think that&nbsp;<a NAME="68"></a>I
am most likely to hear this; and therefore I will praise the unjust life&nbsp;<a NAME="69"></a>to
the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking will indicate the&nbsp;<a NAME="70"></a>manner
in which I desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring&nbsp;<a NAME="71"></a>injustice.
Will you say whether you approve of my proposal?&nbsp;<a NAME="72"></a>

<p>Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about whic
h a man of sense&nbsp;<a NAME="73"></a>would
oftener wish to converse.&nbsp;<a NAME="74"></a>

<p>I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin&nbsp;<a NAME="75"></a>by
speaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of&nbsp;<a NAME="76"></a>justice.&nbsp;<a NAME="77"></a>

<p>Glaucon&nbsp;<a NAME="78"></a>

<p>They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,&nbsp;<a NAME="79"></a>evil;
but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have&nbsp;
<a NAME="80"></a>both
done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being&nbsp;<a NAME="81"></a>able
to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better&nbsp;<a NAME="82"></a>agree
among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual&nbsp;<a NAME="83"></a>covenants;
and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and&nbsp;<a NAME="84"></a>just.
This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice; --it is&nbsp;<a NAME="85"></a>a
mean o
r compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice&nbsp;<a NAME="86"></a>and
not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice&nbsp;<a NAME="87"></a>without
the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point&nbsp;<a NAME="88"></a>between
the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and&nbsp;<a NAME="89"></a>honoured
by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. For no man&nbsp;<a NAME="90"></a>who
is worthy to be called a man would ever su
bmit to such an agreement&nbsp;<a NAME="91"></a>if
he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received&nbsp;<a NAME="92"></a>account,
Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.&nbsp;<a NAME="93"></a>

<p>Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because&nbsp;<a NAME="94"></a>they
have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something&nbsp;<a NAME="95"></a>of
this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do&nbsp;<a NAME="96"></a>what
they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them; then&nbsp;<a NAME="97"></a>we
shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding&nbsp;<a NAME="98"></a>along
the same road, following their interest, which all natures deem to&nbsp;<a NAME="99"></a>be
their good, and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force&nbsp;<a NAME="100"></a>of
law. The liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given&nbsp;<a NAME="101"></a>to
them in the form o
f such a power as is said to have been possessed by&nbsp;<a NAME="102"></a>Gyges
the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian. According to the tradition, Gyges&nbsp;<a NAME="103"></a>was
a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm,&nbsp;<a NAME="104"></a>and
an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was&nbsp;<a NAME="105"></a>feeding
his flock. Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening,&nbsp;<a NAME="106"></a>where,
among other marvels, he beheld a hol
low brazen horse, having doors,&nbsp;<a NAME="107"></a>at
which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared&nbsp;<a NAME="108"></a>to
him, more than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he&nbsp;<a NAME="109"></a>took
from the finger of the dead and reascended. Now the shepherds met&nbsp;<a NAME="110"></a>together,
according to custom, that they might send their monthly report&nbsp;<a NAME="111"></a>about
the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the
 ring&nbsp;<a NAME="112"></a>on
his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the&nbsp;<a NAME="113"></a>collet
of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible&nbsp;<a NAME="114"></a>to
the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were&nbsp;<a NAME="115"></a>no
longer present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring&nbsp;<a NAME="116"></a>he
turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of&nbsp;<a NAME="117"></a>the

ring, and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards&nbsp;<a NAME="118"></a>he
became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived&nbsp;<a NAME="119"></a>to
be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court; where as&nbsp;<a NAME="120"></a>soon
as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help conspired against&nbsp;<a NAME="121"></a>the
king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now that there were&nbsp;<a NAME="122"></a>two
such magic rings, a
nd the just put on one of them and the unjust the&nbsp;<a NAME="123"></a>other;,no
man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would&nbsp;<a NAME="124"></a>stand
fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his&nbsp;<a NAME="125"></a>own
when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into&nbsp;<a NAME="126"></a>houses
and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison&nbsp;<a NAME="127"></a>whom
he would, and in all respects be like a Go
d among men. Then the actions&nbsp;<a NAME="128"></a>of
the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come&nbsp;<a NAME="129"></a>at
last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof&nbsp;<a NAME="130"></a>that
a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is&nbsp;<a NAME="131"></a>any
good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks&nbsp;<a NAME="132"></a>that
he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men belie
ve in&nbsp;<a NAME="133"></a>their
hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than&nbsp;<a NAME="134"></a>justice,
and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they&nbsp;<a NAME="135"></a>are
right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming&nbsp;<a NAME="136"></a>invisible,
and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he&nbsp;<a NAME="137"></a>would
be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although&nbsp;<a NAME="138"></a>they
would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with&nbsp;<a NAME="139"></a>one
another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice. Enough of&nbsp;<a NAME="140"></a>this.&nbsp;<a NAME="141"></a>

<p>Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just&nbsp;<a NAME="142"></a>and
unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the&nbsp;<a NAME="143"></a>isolation
to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust,&nbsp;<a NAME="144"></a>and
the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either&nbsp;<a NAME="145"></a>of
them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective&nbsp;<a NAME="146"></a>lives.
First, let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft;&nbsp;<a NAME="147"></a>like
the skilful pilot or physician, who knows intuitively his own powers&nbsp;<a NAME="148"></a>and
keeps within their limits, and who, if he fails at any point, is able&nbsp;<a NAME="149"></a>to
recover him
self. So let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right&nbsp;<a NAME="150"></a>way,
and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice (he who is&nbsp;<a NAME="151"></a>found
out is nobody): for the highest reach of injustice is: to be deemed&nbsp;<a NAME="152"></a>just
when you are not. Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man&nbsp;<a NAME="153"></a>we
must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction,&nbsp;<a NAME="154"></a>but
we must allow him, while doing the m
ost unjust acts, to have acquired&nbsp;<a NAME="155"></a>the
greatest reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step he must&nbsp;<a NAME="156"></a>be
able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if&nbsp;<a NAME="157"></a>any
of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is&nbsp;<a NAME="158"></a>required
his courage and strength, and command of money and friends. And&nbsp;<a NAME="159"></a>at
his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simpl
icity,&nbsp;<a NAME="160"></a>wishing,
as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. There must be no&nbsp;<a NAME="161"></a>seeming,
for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and&nbsp;<a NAME="162"></a>then
we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for&nbsp;<a NAME="163"></a>the
sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in justice&nbsp;<a NAME="164"></a>only,
and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a state of&nbsp;<a NAME="165"></a>life
the opposite of the former. Let him be the best of men, and let him&nbsp;<a NAME="166"></a>be
thought the worst; then he will have been put to the proof; and we shall&nbsp;<a NAME="167"></a>see
whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences.&nbsp;<a NAME="168"></a>And
let him continue thus to the hour of death; being just and seeming&nbsp;<a NAME="169"></a>to
be unjust. When both have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of&nbsp;<a NAME="170"></a>justice
and the other
 of injustice, let judgment be given which of them&nbsp;<a NAME="171"></a>is
the happier of the two.&nbsp;<a NAME="172"></a>

<p>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<a NAME="173"></a>

<p>Heavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish&nbsp;<a NAME="174"></a>them
up for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were&nbsp;<a NAME="175"></a>two
statues.&nbsp;<a NAME="176"></a>

<p>I do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like&nbsp;<a NAME="177"></a>there
is no diffic
ulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either&nbsp;<a NAME="178"></a>of
them. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the description&nbsp;<a NAME="179"></a>a
little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that the words which&nbsp;<a NAME="180"></a>follow
are not mine. --Let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists&nbsp;<a NAME="181"></a>of
injustice: They will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust&nbsp;<a NAME="182"></a>will
be scourged, racked, bound --wil
l have his eyes burnt out; and, at&nbsp;<a NAME="183"></a>last,
after suffering every kind of evil, he will be impaled: Then he will&nbsp;<a NAME="184"></a>understand
that he ought to seem only, and not to be, just; the words of&nbsp;<a NAME="185"></a>Aeschylus
may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just. For&nbsp;<a NAME="186"></a>the
unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not live with a view to appearances&nbsp;<a NAME="187"></a>--he
wants to be really unjust and not to seem only:--&nbsp;
<a NAME="188"></a>

<p>His mind has a soil deep and fertile,&nbsp;<a NAME="189"></a>
<br>Out of which spring his prudent counsels. In the first place, he is&nbsp;<a NAME="190"></a>thought
just, and therefore bears rule in the city; he can marry whom he&nbsp;<a NAME="191"></a>will,
and give in marriage to whom he will; also he can trade and deal&nbsp;<a NAME="192"></a>where
he likes, and always to his own advantage, because he has no misgivings&nbsp;<a NAME="193"></a>about
injustice and at every conte
st, whether in public or private, he&nbsp;<a NAME="194"></a>gets
the better of his antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is&nbsp;<a NAME="195"></a>rich,
and out of his gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies;&nbsp;<a NAME="196"></a>moreover,
he can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly&nbsp;<a NAME="197"></a>and
magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to&nbsp;<a NAME="198"></a>honour
in a far better style than the just, and therefore h
e is likely&nbsp;<a NAME="199"></a>to
be dearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men&nbsp;<a NAME="200"></a>are
said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life&nbsp;<a NAME="201"></a>of
the just.&nbsp;<a NAME="202"></a>

<p>Adeimantus -SOCRATES&nbsp;<a NAME="203"></a>

<p>I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus,&nbsp;<a NAME="204"></a>his
brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there&nbsp;<a NAME="205"></a>
is
nothing more to be urged?&nbsp;<a NAME="206"></a>

<p>Why, what else is there? I answered.&nbsp;<a NAME="207"></a>
<br>The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he&nbsp;<a NAME="208"></a>replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="209"></a>
<br>Well, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother' --if&nbsp;<a NAME="210"></a>he
fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that Glaucon&nbsp;<a NAME="211"></a>has
already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take from me t
he&nbsp;<a NAME="212"></a>power
of helping justice.&nbsp;<a NAME="213"></a>

<p>Adeimantus&nbsp;<a NAME="214"></a>

<p>Nonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is another&nbsp;<a NAME="215"></a>side
to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice and&nbsp;<a NAME="216"></a>injustice,
which is equally required in order to bring out what I believe&nbsp;<a NAME="217"></a>to
be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their sons and&nbsp;<a NAME="218"></a>their


wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake of justice,&nbsp;<a NAME="219"></a>but
for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of obtaining&nbsp;<a NAME="220"></a>for
him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages, and the like&nbsp;<a NAME="221"></a>which
Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust&nbsp;<a NAME="222"></a>from
the reputation of justice. More, however, is made of appearances by&nbsp;<a NAME="223"></a>this
class of persons than by
 the others; for they throw in the good opinion&nbsp;<a NAME="224"></a>of
the gods, and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens,&nbsp;<a NAME="225"></a>as
they say, rain upon the pious; and this accords with the testimony of&nbsp;<a NAME="226"></a>the
noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of whom says, that the gods make&nbsp;<a NAME="227"></a>the
oaks of the just--&nbsp;<a NAME="228"></a>

<p>To hear acorns at their summit, and bees I the&nbsp;<a NAME="229"></a>middle;&nbsp;<a NAME="230">
</a>
<br>And the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces. and&nbsp;<a NAME="231"></a>many
other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And Homer has&nbsp;<a NAME="232"></a>a
very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame&nbsp;<a NAME="233"></a>is--&nbsp;<a NAME="234"></a>

<p>As the fame of some blameless king who, like a&nbsp;<a NAME="235"></a>god,&nbsp;<a NAME="236"></a>
<br>Maintains justice to whom the black earth brings&nbsp;<a NAME="237"></a>forth&nbsp;<a NAME="238">
</a>
<br>Wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit,&nbsp;<a NAME="239"></a>
<br>And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish. Still&nbsp;<a NAME="240"></a>grander
are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe to&nbsp;<a NAME="241"></a>the
just; they take them down into the world below, where they have the&nbsp;<a NAME="242"></a>saints
lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk, crowned with garlands;&nbsp;<a NAME="243"></a>their
idea seems to be that an imm
ortality of drunkenness is the highest&nbsp;<a NAME="244"></a>meed
of virtue. Some extend their rewards yet further; the posterity, as&nbsp;<a NAME="245"></a>they
say, of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth&nbsp;<a NAME="246"></a>generation.
This is the style in which they praise justice. But about the&nbsp;<a NAME="247"></a>wicked
there is another strain; they bury them in a slough in Hades, and&nbsp;<a NAME="248"></a>make
them carry water in a sieve; also while they are yet li
ving they bring&nbsp;<a NAME="249"></a>them
to infamy, and inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described&nbsp;<a NAME="250"></a>as
the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does&nbsp;<a NAME="251"></a>their
invention supply. Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring&nbsp;<a NAME="252"></a>the
other.&nbsp;<a NAME="253"></a>

<p>Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of&nbsp;<a NAME="254"></a>speaking
about justice and injustice, wh
ich is not confined to the poets,&nbsp;<a NAME="255"></a>but
is found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always&nbsp;<a NAME="256"></a>declaring
that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and toilsome;&nbsp;<a NAME="257"></a>and
that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment, and&nbsp;<a NAME="258"></a>are
only censured by law and opinion. They say also that honesty is for&nbsp;<a NAME="259"></a>the
most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they are quit
e ready&nbsp;<a NAME="260"></a>to
call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in public and private&nbsp;<a NAME="261"></a>when
they are rich or in any other way influential, while they despise&nbsp;<a NAME="262"></a>and
overlook those who may be weak and poor, even though acknowledging&nbsp;<a NAME="263"></a>them
to be better than the others. But most extraordinary of all is their&nbsp;<a NAME="264"></a>mode
of speaking about virtue and the gods: they say that the gods apportion&nbsp;<a NAME="265">
</a>calamity
and misery to many good men, and good and happiness to the wicked.&nbsp;<a NAME="266"></a>And
mendicant prophets go to rich men's doors and persuade them that they&nbsp;<a NAME="267"></a>have
a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a&nbsp;<a NAME="268"></a>man's
own or his ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings&nbsp;<a NAME="269"></a>and
feasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust,&nbsp;<a NAME="270"></a>at
a small cost; wit
h magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they&nbsp;<a NAME="271"></a>say,
to execute their will. And the poets are the authorities to whom they&nbsp;<a NAME="272"></a>appeal,
now smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod;&nbsp;<a NAME="273"></a>--&nbsp;<a NAME="274"></a>

<p>Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth&nbsp;<a NAME="275"></a>and
her dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil,&nbsp;<a NAME="276"></a>and
a tedious and uphill roa
d: then citing Homer as a witness that the&nbsp;<a NAME="277"></a>gods
may be influenced by men; for he also says:&nbsp;<a NAME="278"></a>

<p>The gods, too, may he turned from their purpose; and men pray to&nbsp;<a NAME="279"></a>them
and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by&nbsp;<a NAME="280"></a>libations
and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed.&nbsp;<a NAME="281"></a>And
they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who were&nbsp;<a NA ME="282"></a>children
of the Moon and the Muses --that is what they say --according&nbsp;<a NAME="283"></a>to
which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals,&nbsp;<a NAME="284"></a>but
whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by&nbsp;<a NAME="285"></a>sacrifices
and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at&nbsp;<a NAME="286"></a>the
service of the living and the dead; the latter sort they call mysteries,&nbsp;<a NAME="287"></a>and
they redeem 
us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect them no one&nbsp;<a NAME="288"></a>knows
what awaits us.&nbsp;<a NAME="289"></a>

<p>He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue&nbsp;<a NAME="290"></a>and
vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their&nbsp;<a NAME="291"></a>minds
likely to be affected, my dear Socrates, --those of them, I mean,&nbsp;<a NAME="292"></a>who
are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower,&nbsp;<a NAME="293"></a>
and
from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner&nbsp;<a NAME="294"></a>of
persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would&nbsp;<a NAME="295"></a>make
the best of life? Probably the youth will say to himself in the words&nbsp;<a NAME="296"></a>of
Pindar--&nbsp;<a NAME="297"></a>

<p>Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier&nbsp;<a NAME="298"></a>tower
which may he a fortress to me all my days? For what men say is that,&nbsp;<a NAM E="299"></a>if
I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none,&nbsp;<a NAME="300"></a>but
the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable. But if, though&nbsp;<a NAME="301"></a>unjust,
I acquire the reputation of justice, a heavenly life is promised&nbsp;<a NAME="302"></a>to
me. Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth&nbsp;<a NAME="303"></a>and
is lord of happiness, to appearance I must devote myself. I will describe&nbsp;<a NAME="304"></a>around
me
 a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior&nbsp;<a NAME="305"></a>of
my house; behind I will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus,&nbsp;<a NAME="306"></a>greatest
of sages, recommends. But I hear some one exclaiming that the&nbsp;<a NAME="307"></a>concealment
of wickedness is often difficult; to which I answer, Nothing&nbsp;<a NAME="308"></a>great
is easy. Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we would be&nbsp;<a NAME="309"></a>happy,
to be the path along which 
we should proceed. With a view to concealment&nbsp;<a NAME="310"></a>we
will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs. And there are&nbsp;<a NAME="311"></a>professors
of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies;&nbsp;<a NAME="312"></a>and
so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall make unlawful&nbsp;<a NAME="313"></a>gains
and not be punished. Still I hear a voice saying that the gods cannot&nbsp;<a NAME="314"></a>be
deceived, neither can they be compelled. But
 what if there are no gods?&nbsp;<a NAME="315"></a>or,
suppose them to have no care of human things --why in either case should&nbsp;<a NAME="316"></a>we
mind about concealment? And even if there are gods, and they do care&nbsp;<a NAME="317"></a>about
us, yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of&nbsp;<a NAME="318"></a>the
poets; and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced&nbsp;<a NAME="319"></a>and
turned by 'sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerin
gs.' Let&nbsp;<a NAME="320"></a>us
be consistent then, and believe both or neither. If the poets speak&nbsp;<a NAME="321"></a>truly,
why then we had better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice;&nbsp;<a NAME="322"></a>for
if we are just, although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we&nbsp;<a NAME="323"></a>shall
lose the gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep&nbsp;<a NAME="324"></a>the
gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning, the&nbsp;<a NAME="325"></a>gods
will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished. 'But there is a&nbsp;<a NAME="326"></a>world
below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust&nbsp;<a NAME="327"></a>deeds.'
Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there are mysteries&nbsp;<a NAME="328"></a>and
atoning deities, and these have great power. That is what mighty cities&nbsp;<a NAME="329"></a>declare;
and the children of the gods, who were their poets and prophets,&nbsp;<a NAME="330"></a>bear
a like testi
mony.&nbsp;<a NAME="331"></a>

<p>On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather&nbsp;<a NAME="332"></a>than
the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful&nbsp;<a NAME="333"></a>regard
to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men,&nbsp;<a NAME="334"></a>in
life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest authorities&nbsp;<a NAME="335"></a>tell
us. Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has any superiority&nbsp;<a NAME="
336"></a>of
mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour justice; or indeed&nbsp;<a NAME="337"></a>to
refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised? And even if there&nbsp;<a NAME="338"></a>should
be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words, and who&nbsp;<a NAME="339"></a>is
satisfied that justice is best, still he is not angry with the unjust,&nbsp;<a NAME="340"></a>but
is very ready to forgive them, because he also knows that men are not&nbsp;<a NAME="341"></a>just
of t
heir own free will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom&nbsp;<a NAME="342"></a>the
divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or&nbsp;<a NAME="343"></a>who
has attained knowledge of the truth --but no other man. He only blames&nbsp;<a NAME="344"></a>injustice
who, owing to cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the&nbsp;<a NAME="345"></a>power
of being unjust. And this is proved by the fact that when he obtains&nbsp;<a NAME="346"></a>the
power, he immediately becomes
 unjust as far as he can&nbsp;<a NAME="347"></a>be.&nbsp;<a NAME="348"></a>

<p>The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning&nbsp;<a NAME="349"></a>of
the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were&nbsp;<a NAME="350"></a>to
find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice --beginning with&nbsp;<a NAME="351"></a>the
ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and ending&nbsp;<a NAME="352"></a>with
the men of our own time --no one has
 ever blamed injustice or praised&nbsp;<a NAME="353"></a>justice
except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits which&nbsp;<a NAME="354"></a>flow
from them. No one has ever adequately described either in verse or&nbsp;<a NAME="355"></a>prose
the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul,&nbsp;<a NAME="356"></a>and
invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of all the things&nbsp;<a NAME="357"></a>of
a man's soul which he has within him, justice is the greatest good,
&nbsp;<a NAME="358"></a>and
injustice the greatest evil. Had this been the universal strain, had&nbsp;<a NAME="359"></a>you
sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards, we should not&nbsp;<a NAME="360"></a>have
been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong, but every&nbsp;<a NAME="361"></a>one
would have been his own watchman, because afraid, if he did wrong,&nbsp;<a NAME="362"></a>of
harbouring in himself the greatest of evils. I dare say that Thrasymachus&nbsp;<a NAME="363"></a>and


others would seriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating,&nbsp;<a NAME="364"></a>and
words even stronger than these about justice and injustice, grossly,&nbsp;<a NAME="365"></a>as
I conceive, perverting their true nature. But I speak in this vehement&nbsp;<a NAME="366"></a>manner,
as I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from you&nbsp;<a NAME="367"></a>the
opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority&nbsp;<a NAME="368"></a>which
justice has ove
r injustice, but what effect they have on the possessor&nbsp;<a NAME="369"></a>of
them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him.&nbsp;<a NAME="370"></a>And
please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations; for unless&nbsp;<a NAME="371"></a>you
take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false,&nbsp;<a NAME="372"></a>we
shall say that you do not praise justice, but the appearance of it;&nbsp;<a NAME="373"></a>we
shall think that you are only exhorting u
s to keep injustice dark, and&nbsp;<a NAME="374"></a>that
you really agree with Thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another's&nbsp;<a NAME="375"></a>good
and the interest of the stronger, and that injustice is a man's own&nbsp;<a NAME="376"></a>profit
and interest, though injurious to the weaker. Now as you have admitted&nbsp;<a NAME="377"></a>that
justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed&nbsp;<a NAME="378"></a>for
their results, but in a far greater degree for their 
own sakes --like&nbsp;<a NAME="379"></a>sight
or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural&nbsp;<a NAME="380"></a>and
not merely conventional good --I would ask you in your praise of justice&nbsp;<a NAME="381"></a>to
regard one point only: I mean the essential good and evil which justice&nbsp;<a NAME="382"></a>and
injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others praise justice&nbsp;<a NAME="383"></a>and
censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and&nbsp;<a NAME="384"></a>abusing
the other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them,&nbsp;<a NAME="385"></a>I
am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in&nbsp;<a NAME="386"></a>the
consideration of this question, unless I hear the contrary from your&nbsp;<a NAME="387"></a>own
lips, I expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only prove&nbsp;<a NAME="388"></a>to
us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they either&nbsp;<a NAME="389"></a>of
them do to 
the possessor of them, which makes the one to be a good and&nbsp;<a NAME="390"></a>the
other an evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and&nbsp;<a NAME="391"></a>men.&nbsp;<a NAME="392"></a>

<p>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS&nbsp;<a NAME="393"></a>

<p>I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but&nbsp;<a NAME="394"></a>on
hearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an illustrious&nbsp;<a NAME="395"></a>father,
that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the admir
er&nbsp;<a NAME="396"></a>of
Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves&nbsp;<a NAME="397"></a>at
the battle of Megara:--&nbsp;<a NAME="398"></a>

<p>'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious&nbsp;<a NAME="399"></a>hero.'
The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine&nbsp;<a NAME="400"></a>in
being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice,&nbsp;<a NAME="401"></a>and
remaining unconvinced by your own argument
s. And I do believe that&nbsp;<a NAME="402"></a>you
are not convinced --this I infer from your general character, for had&nbsp;<a NAME="403"></a>I
judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But now,&nbsp;<a NAME="404"></a>the
greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in knowing&nbsp;<a NAME="405"></a>what
to say. For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand I feel that&nbsp;<a NAME="406"></a>I
am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to me by the&amp;nbsp;<a NAME="407"></a>fact
that you were not satisfied with the answer which I made to Thrasymachus,&nbsp;<a NAME="408"></a>proving,
as I thought, the superiority which justice has over injustice.&nbsp;<a NAME="409"></a>And
yet I cannot refuse to help, while breath and speech remain to me;&nbsp;<a NAME="410"></a>I
am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice&nbsp;<a NAME="411"></a>is
evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence. And therefore&nbsp;<a NAME="412"></a>I
had best give such help as I can.&nbsp;<a NAME="413"></a>

<p>Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question&nbsp;<a NAME="414"></a>drop,
but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the&nbsp;<a NAME="415"></a>truth,
first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,&nbsp;<a NAME="416"></a>about
their relative advantages. I told them, what I --really thought,&nbsp;<a NAME="417"></a>that
the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would requir
e very good&nbsp;<a NAME="418"></a>eyes.
Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that we had&nbsp;<a NAME="419"></a>better
adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that a short-sighted&nbsp;<a NAME="420"></a>person
had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance;&nbsp;<a NAME="421"></a>and
it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place&nbsp;<a NAME="422"></a>which
was larger and in which the letters were larger --if they were the&nbsp;
<a NAME="423"></a>same
and he could read the larger letters first, and then proceed to the&nbsp;<a NAME="424"></a>lesser
--this would have been thought a rare piece of good&nbsp;<a NAME="425"></a>fortune.&nbsp;<a NAME="426"></a>

<p>Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply&nbsp;<a NAME="427"></a>to
our enquiry?&nbsp;<a NAME="428"></a>

<p>I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our&nbsp;<a NAME="429"></a>enquiry,
is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the
 virtue of an individual,&nbsp;<a NAME="430"></a>and
sometimes as the virtue of a State.&nbsp;<a NAME="431"></a>

<p>True, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="432"></a>
<br>And is not a State larger than an individual?&nbsp;<a NAME="433"></a>
<br>It is.&nbsp;<a NAME="434"></a>
<br>Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and&nbsp;<a NAME="435"></a>more
easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature&nbsp;<a NAME="436"></a>of
justice and injustice, first as they
 appear in the State, and secondly&nbsp;<a NAME="437"></a>in
the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing&nbsp;<a NAME="438"></a>them.&nbsp;<a NAME="439"></a>

<p>That, he said, is an excellent proposal.&nbsp;<a NAME="440"></a>
<br>And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the&nbsp;<a NAME="441"></a>justice
and injustice of the State in process of creation&nbsp;<a NAME="442"></a>also.&nbsp;<a NAME="443"></a>

<p>I dare say.&nbsp;<a NAME="444"></a>
<b R>When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of&nbsp;<a NAME="445"></a>our
search will be more easily discovered.&nbsp;<a NAME="446"></a>
<div ALIGN="right">Yes, far more easily.&nbsp;<a NAME="447"></a></div>
