QUESTIONS DUE FRIDAY AT HIGH NOON ON APRIL 9TH</font></font></b>

<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">Questions concern Descartes
Meditations 1, 2, 3 (on web), 5 and 6 found in Kessler; Descartes' Letters
to the Princess (Kessler p. 470); and also Cole's &quot;Mind, Body and Gender&quot;
p. 476 in Kessler</font></font></b>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><font face="Arial Black">1a: Descartes argues that there is almost no
sources of true and certain knowledge. Give one of his argument that some
thing ----which seems certain---can be doubted.&nbsp; 2b: What is the first
thing that cannot be doubted?</font>
<p><font face="Arial Black">2: Descartes argues that if the self's existence
cannot be doubted, then God must exist because nothing less than God could
be the cause of the self's existence. Give one of his arguments that some
thing cannot cause the self's existence. For example, why cann't parents
cause the self's existence?</font>
<p><font face="Arial Black">3: Descartes argues that if God exists, He
must be good. Why couldn't God be evil?</font>
<p><font face="Arial Black">4: In Descartes' Letters to the Princess (Kessler
p. 470), Descartes answers various objections to his philosophy and explains
how the body and soul interact. Give one of his explanations.</font>
<p><font face="Arial Black">5: What is Cole's main argument?</font>
<p><font face="Arial Black">6:&nbsp; Feminists argue that traditional western
philosophy has treated the human soul as an independent self. This is mistaken
because the self is relational. If Cole were to encounter Aquinas would
they agree on this point. Why or why not? (Remember, Aquinas not only argued
that every living body is animated by only one soul, but that the self
exists to love others as itself.)</font>

Meditation Five or Six.</font>
