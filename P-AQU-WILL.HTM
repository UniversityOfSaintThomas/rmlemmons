<h3><big>AQUINAS ON THE WILL</big><br>

<h3><big><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><big><font

<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>Objection 
3.</b> Further, by the will we are masters of our own actions. But we  are 
not masters of that which is of necessity. Therefore the act of the  will 
cannot be necessitated.  </font></font></p>
   
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>On 
the contrary,</b> Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 4) that "all desire  happiness 
with one will." Now if this were not necessary, but contingent,  there would 
at least be a few exceptions. Therefore the will desires  something of necessity.
  </font></font></p>
   
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>I answer
that,</b> . . . as the intellect necessarily adheres to the  first principles, 
the will necessarily adheres to the last end,  which is happiness: since the
end is in practical matters what the  principle is in speculative matters.&nbsp;
 </font></font></p>
   <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>Reply 
to Objection 3.</b> We are masters of our own actions by reason of our being 
 able to choose this or that. But choice regards not the end, but "the  means 
to the end," as the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> 
says (Ethic. iii, 9). Wherefore the  desire of the ultimate end does not regard
those actions of which we are  masters. [Freedom lies in the means, not the
end of happiness.]<br>

it desires?</big></big></font></big></font></b></big>   
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>Objection 
1.</b> It would seem that the will . . .&nbsp; tends of necessity to  the
good which is proposed to it.  </font></font></p>
   
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>Objection 
2.</b>&nbsp; it seems that the will's object [goodness] moves it of  necessity.
 </font></font></p>
   
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>Objection 
3.</b> Further, as the thing apprehended by sense is the object of the  sensitive 
appetite, so the thing apprehended by the intellect is the  object of the 
intellectual appetite, which is called the will. But what  is apprehended 
by the sense moves the sensitive appetite of necessity:  for Augustine says 
(Gen. ad lit. ix, 14) that "animals are moved by  things seen." Therefore 
it seems that whatever is apprehended by the  intellect moves the will of 
necessity.  </font></font></p>
   
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>On 
the contrary,</b> Augustine says (Retract. i, 9) that "it is  the will by 
 which we sin and live well," and so the will extends to opposite things. 
 Therefore it does not desire of necessity all things whatsoever it  desires.
  </font></font></p>
   
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>I answer
that,</b> The will does not desire of necessity whatsoever it  desires. [The
will necessarily desires perfect goodness but not finite and imperfect forms
of goodness.]  </font></font></p>
   
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>Reply 
to Objection 1.</b> The will can tend to nothing except under the aspect of
 good. But because good is of many kinds, for this reason the will is not
 of necessity determined to one.  </font></font></p>
   
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>Reply 
to Objection 2.</b>&nbsp; But as the capacity of the  will regards the universal 
and perfect good, its capacity is not  subjected to any individual good. And
therefore it is not of necessity  moved by it.  </font></font></p>
  <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><font size="-1"><b>Reply 
to Objection 3.</b> The sensitive power does not compare different things 
with  each other, as reason does: but it simply apprehends some one thing. 
 Therefore, according to that one thing, it moves the sensitive appetite 
in a determinate way. But the reason is a power that compares several  things 
together: therefore from several things the intellectual  appetite--that is,
the will--may be moved; but not of necessity from  one thing.</font></font><br

<p><strong>I.83.1: WHETHER MAN HAS FREE-WILL?</strong>  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </p>
 
<p>	OBJ 5: Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 5): "According as each 
one is, such does the end seem to him." But it is not in our power to be of
one quality or another; for this comes to us from nature. <strong>Therefore</strong> 
it is natural to us to follow some particular end, and <strong>therefore</strong> 
we are not free in so doing.    </p>
 
<p>	On the contrary, It is written (Ecclus. 15:14): "God made man from the 
beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel"; and the gloss adds: 
"That is of his free-will."    </p>
 
<p><big>	I answer that,</big> Man has free-will: <b>otherwise</b> counsels,
exhortations, commands, prohibitions, rewards, and punishments would be in
vain. In order to make this evident, we must observe that some things act
without judgment; as a stone moves downwards; and in like manner all things
which lack knowledge. And some act from judgment, but not a free judgment;
as brute animals. For the sheep, seeing the wolf, judges it a thing to be
shunned, from a natural and not a free judgment, <strong>because</strong>
it judges, not from reason, but from natural instinct. And the same thing
is to be said of any judgment of brute animals. But man acts from judgment,
<strong>because</strong> by his apprehensive power he judges that something
should be avoided or sought. But <strong>because</strong> this judgment,
in the case of some particular act, is not from a natural instinct, but from
some act of comparison in the reason, <strong>therefore</strong> he acts
from free judgment and retains  the power of being inclined to various things.
For reason in contingent matters may follow opposite courses, as we see in
dialectic syllogisms and rhetorical arguments. Now particular operations
are contingent, and <strong>therefore</strong> in such matters the judgment
of reason may follow opposite courses, and is not determinate to one. And
forasmuch as man is rational is it necessary that man have a free-will. 
<br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </p>
 
<p>	Reply OBJ 5: Quality in man is of two kinds: natural and adventitious. 
Now the natural quality may be in the intellectual part, or in the body and 
its powers. From the very fact, <strong>therefore</strong>, that man is such 
by virtue of a natural quality which is in the intellectual part, he naturally 
desires his last end, which is happiness. Which desire, indeed, is a natural 
desire, and is not subject to free-will, as is clear from what we have said 
above (Q82, AA1,2). But on the part of the body and its powers man may be 
such by virtue of a natural quality, inasmuch as he is of such a temperament 
or disposition due to any impression whatever produced by corporeal causes, 
which cannot affect the intellectual part, <strong>since</strong> it is not 
the act of a corporeal organ. And such as a man is by virtue of a corporeal 
quality, such also does his end seem to him, <strong>because</strong> from 
such a disposition a man is inclined to choose or reject something. But these 
inclinations are subject to the judgment of reason, which the lower appetite 
obeys, as we have said (Q81, A3). <strong>Therefore</strong> this is in no
 way prejudicial to free-will.  </p>
 
<p>	The adventitious qualities are habits and passions, by virtue of which 
a man is inclined to one thing rather than to another. And yet even these 
inclinations are subject to the judgment of reason. Such qualities, too, are
subject to reason, as it is in our power either to acquire them, whether by
causing them or disposing ourselves to them, or to reject them. And so there
is nothing in this that is repugnant to free-will.  <br wp="br1">

<p><strong>DE VERITATE</strong>  &nbsp;</p>
 
<p><strong>24.1: IS MAN ENDOWED WITH FREE CHOICE?</strong>  <br wp="br1">
  </p>
  
<p>	OBJ 7. Slavery is opposed to freedom. But in man there is found the slavery 
of sin, <strong>because</strong> "whoever committeth sin is the servant of 
sin," as is said in John (8:34). In man, then, there is no freedom of choice.
    </p>
  
<p>	OBJ 19. According to the Philosopher, "each person judges of the end in
accordance with his own character." But it is not in our power to be one kind
of person rather than another, <strong>since</strong> a man's particular
 temperament is had from birth and, as some maintain,  depends upon the arrangement 
of the stars. It is <strong>therefore</strong> not in our power to approve 
this or that end. But every judgment about a course of action is based upon 
the end. We are <strong>therefore</strong> not endowed with free choice.
    </p>
   
<p><b>REPLY: &nbsp;</b>Without any doubt it must be affirmed that man is
endowed with free choice. The faith obliges us to this, <strong>since</strong>
without free choice there cannot be merit and demerit, or just punishment
and reward. Clear indications, from which it appears that man freely chooses
one thing and refuses another, also lead us to this. Evident reasoning also
forces us to this conclusion. Tracing out by its means the origin of free
choice for the purposes of our investigation, we shall proceed as follows.
 </p>
 
<p>	Among things which are moved or which act in any way, this difference 
is found. Some have within themselves the principle of their motion or operation; 
and some have it outside themselves, as is the case with those which are moved
violently, "in which the principle is outside and the being subjected to
the violence contributes nothing," as the Philosopher teaches. We cannot hold
free choice to be in the latter inasmuch as they are not the cause of their
own motion, whereas a free being is "that which is for its own sake," as
the Philosopher teaches.   </p>
 
<p>	Among the things whose principle of motion is within themselves some are
such as to move themselves, as animals; but there are some which do not move
themselves even though they do have within themselves some principle of their
motion, as heavy and light things. These do not move themselves <strong>because</strong> 
they cannot be distinguished into two parts, of which one does the moving 
and the other is moved. This double principle is verified in animals. Their 
motion is consequent upon a principle within them, their form. <strong>Because</strong> 
they have this from the being which generated them, they are said to be moved 
essentially by their genitor and accidentally by that which removes an obstacle, 
according to the Philosopher. These are moved by means of themselves but not
by themselves. <strong>Hence</strong> free choice is not found in these either,
<strong>because</strong> they are not their own cause of acting and moving
but are set to acting or moving by something which they have received from
another.  </p>
 
<p>	Among those beings which are moved by themselves, the motions of some 
come from a rational judgment; those of others, from a natural judgment. Men
act and are moved by a rational judgment, for they deliberate about what is
to be done. But all brutes act and are moved by a natural judgment. This is
evident from the fact that all brutes of the same species work in the same
way, as all swallows build their nests alike. It is also evident from the
fact that they have judgment in regard to some definite action, but not  in
regard to all. <strong>Thus</strong> bees have skill at making nothing but
honeycombs; and the same is true of other animals.  </p>
 
<p>	It is accordingly apparent to anyone who considers the matter aright that
judgment about what is to be done is attributed to brute animals in the same
way as motion and action are attributed to inanimate natural bodies. Just
as heavy and light bodies do not move themselves so as to be by that fact
the cause of their own motion, so too brutes do not judge about their own
judgment but follow the judgment implanted in them by God. <strong>Thus</strong> 
they are not the cause of their own decision nor do they have freedom of choice.
But man, judging about his course of action by the power of reason, can also
judge about his own decision inasmuch as he knows the meaning of an end and
of a means to an end, and the relationship of the one with reference to the
other. <strong>Thus</strong> he is his own cause not only in moving but also
in judging. He is <strong>therefore</strong> endowed with free choice--that 
is to say, with a free judgment about acting or not acting.  <br
 wp="br1">
   </p>
 
<p>Reply OBJ 7. The slavery of sin does not imply force, but either inclination
. . .&nbsp; <strong>Thus</strong> there always remains in man the freedom
from force by which he naturally has free choice.  </p>
 
<p>	Reply OBJ 19. [Bodily dispositions, temparment, and personality do not
eliminate freedom.] But no necessity in choosing is thereby introduced into
it, <strong>since</strong> it is within the power of the rational soul to
admit or to repress the passions which arise. Later on, however, a man is
made to be of a certain sort by a habit--either an acquired habit, of which
we are the cause, or an infused  habit, which is not given without our consent
even though we are not the cause of it. From this habit it results that the
man efficaciously tends to an end consonant with that habit. And yet that
habit does not introduce any necessity or take away the freedom of choice.

  </p>
 
<p><strong>D.V. 24.2: IS THERE FREE CHOICE IN BRUTES?</strong>  <br
 wp="br1">
  </p>
 
<p>OBJ 1. We are said to have free choice in so far as our acts are voluntary. 
But according to the Philosopher "children and brutes share in the voluntary." 
<strong>Thus</strong> here is free choice in brutes.    </p>
 
<p>	OBJ 2. According to the Philosopher in everything which moves itself there
is the ability to be moved and not be moved. But brutes move themselves. There
is in them, <strong>therefore</strong>, the ability to be moved and not be
moved. But we are said to be endowed with free choice from the fact that
there is in us the ability to do something. There is, <strong>therefore</strong>, 
free choice in brutes.    </p>
 
<p>	OBJ 3. Free choice implies two things, judgment and freedom, both of which
are to be found in brutes. They have some judgment about what is to be done,
as appears from the fact that they go after one thing and run from another.
They have freedom, <strong>since</strong> they can be moved or not. <strong>Hence</strong>
there is in them free choice.    </p>
 
<p>	OBJ 5. That is said to be free which is not obliged to anything. But the
soul of a brute is not obliged to either of two opposites, <strong>because</strong> 
its power is not determined to one course of action, like the power of natural 
things, which always act in the same way. The soul of a brute <strong>therefore</strong> 
has free choice.    </p>
 
<p>	OBJ 7. As the saints point out, it is a sign that man has free choice 
that he is instigated to good and withdrawn from evil by commands. But we 
see brutes enticed by favors, moved by precepts, or made afraid by threats 
to do something or to let it alone. Brutes <strong>therefore</strong> have 
free choice.  <br wp="br1">
 <br wp="br2">
  </p>
  
<p><b>REPLY:</b> Brutes are by no means endowed with free choice. In explanation
of this it should be noted that, <strong>since</strong> three elements concur
in our activity: knowledge, appetite, and the activity itself, the whole
formal  character of freedom depends upon the manner of knowing. For appetite
follows knowledge, <strong>since</strong> there is appetite only for a good
which is proposed to it by a cognitive power. If appetite sometimes seems
not to  follow knowledge, this is <strong>because</strong> the appetite and
the knowledge are not judged from the same point of view. Appetite is concerned
with a particular object of operation, whereas the judgment of reason is
sometimes concerned with something universal, and this is at times contrary
to our appetite. But a judgment about this particular object of operation
here and now can never be contrary to our appetite. A man who wishes to fornicate, 
for instance, although he knows in general that fornication is evil, nevertheless 
judges this present act of fornication to be good for him and chooses it under
the aspect of good. As Dionysius says, no one acts intending evil.   </p>
 
<p>	Unless there is something to prevent it, a motion or operation follows 
the appetite. <strong>Thus</strong>, if the judgment of the cognitive faculty 
is not in a person's power but is determined for him extrinsically, neither
 will his appetite be in his power; and <strong>consequently</strong> neither 
will his motion or operation be in his power absolutely. Now judgment is in
the power of the one judging in so far as he can judge about his own judgment; 
for we can pass judgment upon the things which are in our power. But to judge 
about one's own judgment belongs only to reason, which reflects upon its own
act and knows the relationships of the things about which it judges and of
those by which it judges. <strong>Hence</strong> the whole root of freedom 
is located in reason. Consequently, a being is related to free choice in the
same way as it is related to reason.  </p>
 
<p>	Reason is found fully and perfectly only in man. Only in him, <strong>therefore</strong>, 
is free choice in its full sense found.  </p>
 
<p>	Brutes have a certain semblance of reason inasmuch as they share in a 
certain natural prudence, and in this respect a lower nature in some way attains
to the property of a higher. This semblance consists in the well-regulated 
judgment which they have about certain things. But they have this judgment 
from a natural estimate, not from any deliberation, <strong>since</strong> 
they are ignorant of the basis of their judgment. On this account such a judgment
does not extend to all things like that of reason, but only to certain determined
objects.  </p>
 
<p>	In like fashion there is in them a certain semblance of free choice inasmuch 
as they can, according to their judgment, do or not do one and the same thing. 
As a result there is in them a sort of conditional freedom. For they can act
if they judge that they should or not act if they do not so judge. But <strong>because</strong>
their judgment is determined to a single course of action, their appetite
and activity also are <strong>consequently</strong>  determined to a single
course. <strong>Hence</strong> "they are moved by things seen," as Augustine
teaches; and as Damascene says, they are driven by passions, <strong>because</strong>
they naturally judge as they do about a particular thing seen or a particular
passion. They are accordingly under the necessity of being moved to flight
or pursuit by the sight of a particular thing or by a passion which is aroused.
A sheep, for example, is under the necessity of fearing and fleeing at the
sight of a wolf, and a dog under the influence of the passion of anger has
to bark and pursue, intent upon hurting. But man is not necessarily moved
by the things which he meets or by the passions which arise,<strong> because</strong>
he can admit or repress them. <strong>consequently</strong>, man has free
choice, but brutes do not.&nbsp;<b></b>  </p>
 
<p>	Reply OBJ 1. "Something voluntary" is held by the Philosopher to be in 
brutes, not in the sense of coming from will but in that of being opposed 
to what is violent. <strong>Thus</strong> the voluntary is said to be in brutes
and in children <strong>because</strong> they act of their accord but not
by the exercise of free choice.    </p>
 
<p>	Reply OBJ 2. The motive power of brutes considered in itself is not any 
more inclined to one of two opposites than to the other. In this sense they 
are said to be able to be moved or not. But the judgment by which the motive 
power is applied to one or the other of the opposites is determined; and so
they do not have free choice.    </p>
 
<p>	Reply OBJ 3. Although there is in brutes a certain indifference in their 
actions, still there cannot properly be said to be in them freedom of action, 
that is, of acting or of not acting. This is so both <strong>because</strong>
 their actions, being carried out by the body, can be forced or prevented 
(which is true not only of brutes but also of men, so that not even man is 
said to be free in his action); and also <strong>because</strong>, although 
there is in brutes an indifference to acting or not acting if the action is
considered in itself, nevertheless, if the relation of the action to the judgment
from which it gets its determination is considered, a certain restriction 
passes over even to the actions themselves, so that there cannot be found 
in them the character of freedom in an absolute sense. Yet, even granted that
there were in brutes some freedom and some judgment, it would still not follow
that they have freedom of judgment, <strong>since</strong> their judgment 
is naturally determined to a single pronouncement.    </p>
 
<p>	Reply OBJ 5. Although the motive power in brutes is not determined to 
one type of action, their judgment about what is to be done is so determined, 
as has been said.    </p>
 
<p>	Reply OBJ 7. Both men and brutes are induced by favors and restrained 
by chastisements, or by commands and prohibitions, but in different ways. 
It is within the power of men when the same things are similarly represented, 
whether they be commands or prohibitions, favors or chastisements, to choose 
or refuse them by a judgment of reason. In brutes, however, there is a natural 
judgment so determined that whatever is proposed or met in one way is accepted 
or rejected in the same way. It happens, though, that from the memory of past
favors or chastisements brutes apprehend something as friendly and to be
pursued or hoped for, and something else as hostile and to be fled or feared.
<strong>Thus</strong> after a beating they are induced by the passion of
fear which arises from it to obey the wish of their instructor. Nor is it
necessary that such things take place in brutes on account of freedom of
choice, but on account of the indifference of their actions.  <br
