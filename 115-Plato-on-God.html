&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; excerpt from
Plato's Republic Book Two</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trans. Jowett</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<small>But which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you
find <a name="862"></a>with them?
<a name="863"></a><br>
<br>
A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, <a
 name="864"></a>and, what is more, a bad lie.
<a name="865"></a><br>
<br>
But when is this fault committed?
<a name="866"></a><br>
Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods <a
 name="867"></a>and heroes, --as when a painter paints a portrait not
having the shadow <a name="868"></a>of a likeness to the original.
<a name="869"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but <a
 name="870"></a>what are the stories which you mean?
<a name="871"></a><br>
<br>
First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies, in high <a
 name="872"></a>places, which the poet told about [the god] Uranus, and
which was a bad lie too, <a name="873"></a>--I mean what Hesiod says
that Uranus did, and how [the god] Cronus retaliated on <a name="874"></a>him.
The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son
inflicted <a name="875"></a>upon him, even if they were true, ought
certainly not to be lightly told <a name="876"></a>to young and
thoughtless persons; if possible, they had better be buried <a
 name="877"></a>in silence. But if there is an absolute necessity for
their mention, a <a name="878"></a>chosen few might hear them in a
mystery, and they should sacrifice not <a name="879"></a>a common
[Eleusinian] pig, but some huge and unprocurable victim; and then <a
 name="880"></a>the number of the hearers will be very few indeed.
<a name="881"></a><br>
<br>
Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely <a name="882"></a>objectionable.
<a name="883"></a><br>
Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; <a
 name="884"></a>the young man should not be told that in committing the
worst of crimes <a name="885"></a>he is far from doing anything
outrageous; and that even if he chastises <a name="886"></a>his father
when does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following <a
 name="887"></a>the example of the first and greatest among the gods.
<a name="888"></a><br>
<br>
I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories <a
 name="889"></a>are quite unfit to be repeated.
<a name="890"></a><br>
<br>
Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of <a
 name="891"></a>quarrelling among themselves as of all things the
basest, should any word <a name="892"></a>be said to them of the wars
in heaven, and of the plots and fightings of <a name="893"></a>the
gods against one another, for they are not true. No, we shall never <a
 name="894"></a>mention the battles of the giants, or let them be
embroidered on garments; <a name="895"></a>and we shall be silent
about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and <a name="896"></a>heroes
with their friends and relatives. If they would only believe us <a
 name="897"></a>we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy, and that
never up to this <a name="898"></a>time has there been any, quarrel
between citizens; this is what old men <a name="899"></a>and old women
should begin by telling children; and when they grow up, <a name="900"></a>the
poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit. <a
 name="901"></a>But the narrative of [the god] Hephaestus binding [the
god] Herre his mother, or how on another <a name="902"></a>occasion
[the god] Zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being
beaten, <a name="903"></a>and all the battles of the gods in Homer
--these tales must not be admitted <a name="904"></a>into our State,
whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning <a name="905"></a>or
not. For a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is <a
 name="906"></a>literal; anything that he receives into his mind at
that age is likely <a name="907"></a>to become indelible and
unalterable; and therefore it is most important <a name="908"></a>that
the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous <a
 name="909"></a>thoughts.
<a name="910"></a><br>
<br>
There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are <a
 name="911"></a>such models to be found and of what tales are you
speaking --how shall <a name="912"></a>we answer him?
<a name="913"></a><br>
<br>
I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, <a
 name="914"></a>but founders of a State: now the founders of a State
ought to know the <a name="915"></a>general forms in which poets
should cast their tales, and the limits which <a name="916"></a>must
be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their <a name="917"></a>business.
<a name="918"></a><br>
<br>
Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which <a
 name="919"></a>you mean?
<a name="920"></a><br>
<br>
Something of this kind, I replied: --<span style="font-weight: bold;">God
is always to be represented </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"
 name="921"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">as he truly is</span>,
whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, <a name="922"></a>in
which the representation is given.
<a name="923"></a><br>
<br>
Right.
<a name="924"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And is he not truly good? and must he
not be represented as </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="925"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">such?
</span><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="926"></a><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Certainly.</span>
<a name="927"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And no good thing is hurtful?
</span><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="928"></a><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">No, indeed</span>.
<a name="929"></a><br>
And that which is not hurtful hurts not?
<a name="930"></a><br>
Certainly not.
<a name="931"></a><br>
And that which hurts not does no evil?
<a name="932"></a><br>
No.
<a name="933"></a><br>
And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?
<a name="934"></a><br>
Impossible.
<a name="935"></a><br>
And the good is advantageous?
<a name="936"></a><br>
Yes.
<a name="937"></a><br>
And therefore the cause of well-being?
<a name="938"></a><br>
Yes.
<a name="939"></a><br>
It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, <a
 name="940"></a>but of the good only?
<a name="941"></a><br>
<br>
Assuredly.
<a name="942"></a><br>
Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many <a
 name="943"></a>assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and
not of most things <a name="944"></a>that occur to men. For few are
the goods of human life, and many are the <a name="945"></a>evils, and<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> the good is to be attributed to God alone;
of the evils the </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="946"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not
in him.
</span><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="947"></a><br>
<br>
That appears to me to be most true, he said.
<a name="948"></a><br>
Then we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty <a
 name="949"></a>of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the
threshold of Zeus, full <a name="950"></a>of lots, one of good, the
other of evil lots, and that he to whom Zeus <a name="951"></a>gives a
mixture of the two Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other <a
 name="952"></a>times with good; but that he to whom is given the cup
of unmingled <a name="953"></a>ill,
<a name="954"></a><br>
<br>
Him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth. And <a name="955"></a>again
<a name="956"></a><br>
<br>
Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us. And if any one <a
 name="957"></a>asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, which
was really the <a name="958"></a>work of Pandarus, was brought about
by Athene and Zeus, or that the strife <a name="959"></a>and
contention of the gods was instigated by Themis and Zeus, he shall <a
 name="960"></a>not have our approval; neither will we allow our young
men to hear the <a name="961"></a>words of Aeschylus, that God plants
guilt among men when he desires utterly <a name="962"></a>to destroy a
house. And if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe --the <a
 name="963"></a>subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses
occur --or of the house <a name="964"></a>of Pelops, or of the Trojan
war or on any similar theme, either we must <a name="965"></a>not
permit him to say that these are the works of God, or if they are of <a
 name="966"></a>God, he must devise some explanation of them such as we
are seeking; he <a name="967"></a>must say that God did what was just
and right, and they were the better <a name="968"></a>for being
punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and <a
 name="969"></a>that God is the author of their misery --the poet is
not to be permitted <a name="970"></a>to say; though he may say that
the wicked are miserable because they require <a name="971"></a>to be
punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from God; but <a
 name="972"></a>that God being good is the author of evil to any one is
to be strenuously <a name="973"></a>denied, and not to be said or sung
or heard in verse or prose by any one <a name="974"></a>whether old or
young in any well-ordered commonwealth. Such a fiction is <a name="975"></a>suicidal,
ruinous, impious.
<a name="976"></a><br>
<br>
I agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to <a
 name="977"></a>the law.
<a name="978"></a><br>
<br>
Let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the <a
 name="979"></a>gods, to which our poets and reciters will be expected
to conform --that <a name="980"></a>God is not the author of all
things, but of good only.
<a name="981"></a><br>
<br>
That will do, he said.
<a name="982"></a><br>
And what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you whether <a
 name="983"></a>God is a magician, and of a nature to appear
insidiously now in one shape, <a name="984"></a>and now in another --<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sometimes himself changing and passing into
many forms, </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="985"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sometimes deceiving us with the semblance
of such transformations; or is </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"
 name="986"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">he one and the same
immutably fixed in his own proper </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"
 name="987"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">image?
</span><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="988"></a><br>
<br>
I cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.
<a name="989"></a><br>
Well, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must <a
 name="990"></a>be effected either by the thing itself, or by some
other <a name="991"></a>thing?
<a name="992"></a><br>
<br>
Most certainly.
<a name="993"></a><br>
And things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered <a
 name="994"></a>or discomposed; for example, when healthiest and
strongest, the human frame <a name="995"></a>is least liable to be
affected by meats and drinks, and the plant which <a name="996"></a>is
in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the <a
 name="997"></a>sun or any similar causes.
<a name="998"></a><br>
<br>
Of course.
<a name="999"></a><br>
And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged <a
 name="1000"></a>by any external influence?
<a name="1001"></a><br>
<br>
True.
<a name="1002"></a><br>
And the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite <a
 name="1003"></a>things --furniture, houses, garments; when good and
well made, they are <a name="1004"></a>least altered by time and
circumstances.
<a name="1005"></a><br>
<br>
Very true.
<a name="1006"></a><br>
Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both, <a
 name="1007"></a>is least liable to suffer change from without?
<a name="1008"></a><br>
<br>
True.
<a name="1009"></a><br>
But surely God and the things of God are in every way <a name="1010"></a>perfect?
<a name="1011"></a><br>
Of course they are.
<a name="1012"></a><br>
Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many <a
 name="1013"></a>shapes?
<a name="1014"></a><br>
<br>
He cannot.
<a name="1015"></a><br>
But may he not change and transform himself?
<a name="1016"></a><br>
Clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at <a
 name="1017"></a>all.
<a name="1018"></a><br>
And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the <a
 name="1019"></a>worse and more unsightly?
<a name="1020"></a><br>
<br>
If <span style="font-weight: bold;">he change at all he can only
change for the worse, for we cannot </span><a
 style="font-weight: bold;" name="1021"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">suppose him to be deficient either in
virtue or beauty.
</span><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="1022"></a><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or <a
 name="1023"></a>man, desire to make himself worse?
<a name="1024"></a><br>
<br>
Impossible.
<a name="1025"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Then it is impossible that God should
ever be willing to change; being, </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"
 name="1026"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">as is supposed, the
fairest and best that is conceivable, every god remains </span><a
 style="font-weight: bold;" name="1027"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">absolutely and for ever in his own form</span>.
<a name="1028"></a><br>
<br>
That necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.
<a name="1029"></a><br>
. . . . <br>
But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft <a
 name="1045"></a>and deception they may make us think that they appear
in various <a name="1046"></a>forms?
<a name="1047"></a><br>
<br>
Perhaps, he replied.
<a name="1048"></a><br>
Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether <a
 name="1049"></a>in word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?
<a name="1050"></a><br>
<br>
I cannot say, he replied.
<a name="1051"></a><br>
Do you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may <a
 name="1052"></a>be allowed, is hated of gods and men?
<a name="1053"></a><br>
<br>
What do you mean? he said.
<a name="1054"></a><br>
I mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest <a
 name="1055"></a>and highest part of himself, or about the truest and
highest matters; there, <a name="1056"></a>above all, he is most
afraid of a lie having possession of <a name="1057"></a>him.
<a name="1058"></a><br>
<br>
Still, he said, I do not comprehend you.
<a name="1059"></a><br>
The reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning <a
 name="1060"></a>to my words; but I am only saying that deception, or
being deceived or <a name="1061"></a>uninformed about the highest
realities in the highest part of themselves, <a name="1062"></a>which
is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie, <a
 name="1063"></a>is what mankind least like; --that, I say, is what
they utterly <a name="1064"></a>detest.
<a name="1065"></a><br>
<br>
There is nothing more hateful to them.
<a name="1066"></a><br>
And, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him <a
 name="1067"></a>who is deceived may be called the true lie; for the
lie in words is only <a name="1068"></a>a kind of imitation and
shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul, <a name="1069"></a>not
pure unadulterated falsehood. Am I not right?
<a name="1070"></a><br>
<br>
Perfectly right.
<a name="1071"></a><br>
The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by <a name="1072"></a>men?
<a name="1073"></a><br>
Yes.
<a name="1074"></a><br>
Whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful; <a
 name="1075"></a>in dealing with enemies --that would be an instance;
or again, when those <a name="1076"></a>whom we call our friends in a
fit of madness or illusion are going to do <a name="1077"></a>some
harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive; also <a
 name="1078"></a>in the tales of mythology, of which we were just now
speaking --because <a name="1079"></a>we do not know the truth about
ancient times, we make falsehood as much <a name="1080"></a>like truth
as we can, and so turn it to account.
<a name="1081"></a><br>
<br>
Very true, he said.
<a name="1082"></a><br>
But can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he is <a
 name="1083"></a>ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to <a
 name="1084"></a>invention?
<a name="1085"></a><br>
<br>
That would be ridiculous, he said.
<a name="1086"></a><br>
Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of <a name="1087"></a>God?
<a name="1088"></a><br>
I should say not.
<a name="1089"></a><br>
Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of <a name="1090"></a>enemies?
<a name="1091"></a><br>
That is inconceivable.
<a name="1092"></a><br>
. . . . <br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Then no motive can be imagined why God
should lie?
</span><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="1096"></a><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">None whatever</span>.
<a name="1097"></a><br>
Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of <a
 name="1098"></a>falsehood?
<a name="1099"></a><br>
Yes.
<a name="1100"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Then is God perfectly simple and true
both in word and deed; he changes </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"
 name="1101"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">not; he deceives not,</span>
either by sign or word, by dream or waking <a name="1102"></a>vision.
<a name="1103"></a><br>
<br>
Your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my <a name="1104"></a>own.
<a name="1105"></a><br>
You agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form <a
 name="1106"></a>in which we should write and speak about divine
things. The gods are not <a name="1107"></a>magicians who transform
themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in <a name="1108"></a>any
way.
<a name="1109"></a><br>
<br>
I grant that.
<a name="1110"></a><br>
