<p class=MsoNormal>Reflections on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fides <span
class=GramE>et</span> Ratio </i>via Cardinal <span class=SpellE>Ratzinger</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Presented
11-15-07 by Dr. Deborah Savage</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. Introduction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to first congratulate you on your name and say that
it is a unique privilege to give what I am thinking of as almost the inaugural
lecture for this august group.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know it
really isn’t since Dr. Lemmons has already gotten you kicked off with Our Lady
the Philosopher. But it would be hard to imagine a more fitting topic than <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fides <span class=GramE>et</span> Ratio </i>for
your first meeting under the official title of Truth Seekers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now in order to avoid giving you just a commentary on a
commentary on this incredible document, I want to say at the outset that I
intend to ground my remarks in the original a bit. In taking a fresh look at
F/R, I must admit I found it difficult not to bring my own favorite passages
and insights to our reflections here today. But our time is short and so our
objectives must be as well. My plan is to zero in on just one theme in Cardinal
<span class=SpellE>Ratzinger’s</span> commentary on FR, one that I think is
especially important for the aims of this group. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But first I think the thing we need to do is to remind
ourselves of what is at stake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No doubt
this is well known to you, or you would not have decided to call yourselves
Truth Seekers. But still – a couple of minutes on the stakes is in order it seems
to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let me start with an example. My niece lived with us for
about 6 months after running away from home after falling under the influence
of some rather shady people. It was a good thing too – she was just 18 years
old so legally free to do what she pleased – but not yet a high school
graduate. She was applying to colleges and had to write an essay in order to
complete most of her applications. She decided to write hers on the perils of
smoking and the evil tobacco companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After struggling with it for a week or so, she came to me in complete
innocence and said to me “Aunt Deborah – I am having trouble figuring out how
to say that smoking is wrong and the tobacco companies are evil without
sounding like I am trying to say something that is actually true. I mean, I
know there is no such thing as truth – like an absolute, right? You have your
truth and I have mine, etc. So how does this work – if there is no such thing
as truth then how do I write this essay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quickly I remembered something I heard in a philosophy
lecture. The argument that there is no such thing as truth does not trump every
truth claim. It has to be supported with argument, it has to be demonstrated.
And of course, as soon as you try, you lose the argument on the basis of some rule
of logic – circuitous reasoning, right? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was so angry I could hardly stand it – my little Paula had
been taught in high school that there was no such thing as truth, which of
course was why she was so ill-equipped to defend herself from the predators that
had persuaded her that her parents were evil and boring and wrong and should be
left behind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fact is that if you give up on the category of truth,
you give up on everything. Indeed the first section of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Fides <span class=GramE>et</span> Ratio </i>is entitled “Know
Yourself.” <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The search for truth is a
“journey of discovery” and above all, the quest for meaning. To give upon this
journey does not just lead to skepticism or subjectivism or relativism –
ultimately it leads to nihilism and results in a young man in the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region> influencing a young man in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Finland</st1:place></st1:country-region> to gun
down innocent people because their lives have no meaning to him since his life
has no meaning to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In F/R, JPII says, it seems self-evident that we are “driven
by the desire to discover the ultimate truth of existence. A favorite
philosopher-theologian of mine, Bernard <span class=SpellE>Lonergan</span>
argues that the desire to know, to understand, to ask questions is a natural
one, a fact that is obvious to anyone with children. He says that, by
definition, knowledge can only be of the true, since knowledge of the false is
not knowledge at all – and that it <span class=GramE>requires - not just a</span>
recognition of a truth as an objective reality – but the concomitant perfection
of the knower. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>To <span class=GramE>know,</span>
and to know truly requires that I simultaneously bring myself into
correspondence with the truth that I discover; a mind under the sway of any
kind of bias will not be able to grasp it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So – you are probably aware of this, but by calling
yourselves truth seekers, you are calling into question some of the most basic
and entrenched assertions of our era. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A Basic
Distinction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we are here to speak about faith and reason and so we
have to be clear about one fundamental assumption that is at the basis of the
Catholic intellectual tradition. It is laid out in F/R and affirmed in <span
class=SpellE>CR’s</span> gloss. You may already know this so forgive me if you
do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the understanding of
relationship between faith and reason in the Catholic intellectual tradition –
that they are unified, coexisting along a continuum, <span class=GramE>complementary</span>
movements in the search for <span class=SpellE>ultimacy</span> – this
understanding has been central to the quite evident potency of the tradition and
has led to the vast treasure evidenced by its thought and contributions to art
and culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JPII points out that it was Aquinas and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">St. Albert</st1:place></st1:City> the Great who were the first to
recognize the autonomy which philosophy and the sciences needed if they were to
perform well in their respective fields of research. But this took a dangerous
turn during the ascendancy of rationalism and there emerged a philosophy which
was separate from and absolutely independent of the contents of faith.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What had been for the patristic and medieval
thinkers – in both theory and practice – a profound unity, producing knowledge
capable of reaching the highest forms of speculation, became a rupture - the
sundering of knowledge from faith. (FR 45) The rationalists rejected knowledge
born of faith; the <span class=SpellE>fideists</span> rejected knowledge born
of reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not so the Church. Grounded in the thought of Aquinas, we
continued to persevere in the quest for <span class=SpellE>ultimacy</span>
using all of our faculties – on the assumption that all of them are God-given
and designed to help bring us home. The reformers and the rationalists arrived
at a radical discontinuity of faith and reason: for them, they were not even on
the same plane. But the Church and her philosophers and theologians see it
quite differently. Aquinas posits the continuity of faith and reason: we can go
as far as we can toward <span class=SpellE>ultimacy</span> – relying on human
reason – but at a certain point in the journey, it is only God and God’s
revelation that can bring us into contact with the complete truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this is one of the underlying assumptions in Cardinal <span
class=SpellE>Ratzinger’s</span> commentary, this continuity, this unity of
faith and reason. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It is essential to
grasping the significance of his insights – for he begins by calling into
question one of those modern day assertions I mentioned earlier – the so-called
historical interpretation of anything said by anyone at any time, which claims
to be objective since it refuses to pronounce anything as true, except those
things that seem to refute what over 2000 years of reflection on human
experience in light of God’s word have concluded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Cardinal points out that behind this façade of
objectivity lies a fundamental perspective on reality – a philosophy which has
at its heart two equally false presumptions that at the same time contradict
each other – first, a conviction that the human person lacks the capacity for
truth, and secondly, the conviction that the individual somehow occupies a
position of superiority to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems odd doesn’t it, that a man of God, in the person of
both the Pope and the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith, would have to take it upon themselves to – as CR says – “restore to
humanity the courage to seek the truth, that is to encourage reason once again
in the adventure of searching for truth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CR argues: “Man is not trapped in a hall of mirrors of
interpretations; one can and must seek a breakthrough to what is really true;
man must ask who he really is and what he is to do; he must ask whether there
is a God; who God is, and what the world is. The one who no longer poses these
questions is by that very fact bereft of any standard or path.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So – though I have the impression that this is essentially a
philosophical group, it seems to me that F/R in particular gives you permission
to operate in full continuity with the tradition – to continue to push the
boundaries of what can be known about ultimate questions through reason.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For truly, philosophy, when coherent, is
always done within the horizon of faith; at the end of the day it cannot be
divorced from that reality fully – or it becomes merely the “empty seriousness”
of Jaspers that CR mentions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. The Real Issue</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now it seems to me that CR is pointing to very high stakes
indeed in his commentary here. He is confronting the very questions that
concern us here at UST and that are implicated in our hope to contribute to the
future of the human race.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He states that
anyone who wishes to seek the truth confronts immediately the problem of
cultures and their mutual openness. He asks us to consider how we can reconcile
Christianity’s claim to universality – a claim grounded in the universality of
truth – in the face of multi-<span class=SpellE>culturalism</span> and the Church’s
missionary activity, which, according to the contemporary critique, seems to
have at best ignored the diversity of cultures – or at worst – subjugated them
to the hegemony of the Christian (a.k.a. white man’s) world view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But he asks this question from outside of history – which is
the only vantage point from which we can understand it. For what is behind this
critique of the church and her missionaries is a fundamental question
concerning the unity of mankind – what is being questioned is fundamentally
what it means to be human. Here is what he says:</p>

<p>The position is gaining ground which maintains that human rights are the
cultural product of the <span class=SpellE>JudeoChristian</span> world and
which, outside this world, would be unintelligible and without foundation. <span
class=GramE>But what then?</span> What happens if we can no longer recognize
common standards which transcend individual cultures? What happens if the unity
of mankind is no longer recognizable to man? </p>

<p>Will not division into separate races, classes and nationalities become
insurmountable? The person who can no longer recognize a common human nature in
others, beyond all such boundaries, has lost his identity. Precisely as a human
being, he is in peril. Thus, for philosophy in its classical and original sense,
the question of truth is not a frivolity to be enjoyed by affluent cultures
which can afford the luxury, but rather a question which concerns the existence
and nonexistence of man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>So, the stakes are
high. And how are we to be seekers of truth without doing violence to those for
whom this word is euphemism for a kind of cultural hegemony, the <span
class=SpellE>eurocentrism</span> mentioned and acknowledged by JPII in F/R? Was
not Christianity compromised from the very beginning as it sought to adapt
itself to the philosophical matrix of the Greek world and thus entered forever
after into the mix of culture and praxis that came to be known as the western
intellectual tradition? Does Christianity have a universality that can be
distinguished from its synthesis with western culture? Is it a universality
that can encompass the diversity of cultural and philosophical frameworks that
have begun to make themselves felt in our current milieu? As seekers of truth
who begin from the premise that Christ is the way, the truth and the life – how
are we to go about our mission?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I believe that CR
shows a way; it is found in the movement of self-transcendence that is either
active or latent in every culture, in every human person. There is no need to
retrace every move CR makes in following this movement – he points out that it
exists in the OT, stating that </span><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s faith requires a continual
self transcendence, an overcoming of its own culture, in order to open itself
and enter into the expansiveness of a truth common to all. The pattern is repeated
in the encounter of the Christian message with Greek Culture - an encounter
which did not begin with the proclamation of the Gospel, but had already
developed within the writings of the Old Testament, above all when these were
translated into Greek, and which continued in early Judaism. The encounter was
made possible because at the same time a similar process of transcending the
particular had begun in the Greek world.” <span class=GramE>Paul’s talk in the <span
class=SpellE>agrophobia</span>?</span> <span class=GramE>On the unknown god.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>“The Fathers of the Church did not simply mix an autonomous and <span
class=SpellE>selfstanding</span> Greek culture into the Gospel. They were able
to take up the dialogue with Greek philosophy and use it as an instrument for
the Gospel, because in the Greek world a form of <span class=SpellE>autocriticism</span>
of their own culture which had arisen through the search for God was already
under way. Beginning with the Germanic and Slavic peoples, who in the period of
the great migrations came into contact with the Christian message, and then
later with the peoples of Asia, Africa and America, the Christian faith
introduced these people not to Greek culture as such, but rather to its
capacity for <span class=SpellE>selftranscendence</span>, which was the true
connecting point for interpreting the Christian message. It drew them into the
dynamic of self transcendence.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Thus the connection
of most interest to us who would seek the truth and wish to proclaim it is to
enter into the culture at the point at which it is beginning to transcend
itself – at the point where it has begun to open itself to universal truth and
thus to lead it out of the enclosure of mere particularity. (<span class=GramE>paraphrasing</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>What examples come
to mind? The environment! World poverty and peace! The sacred nature of
children and their safety! The theology of the body!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A truth that was as operative during the early church as it
is now. </p>
