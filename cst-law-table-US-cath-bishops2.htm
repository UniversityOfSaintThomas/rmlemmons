the seminal United States Bishops' statement on economic justice. The Bishops' stated 
goal was &quot;to look at economic life through the eyes of faith, applying traditional church 
teaching to the U.S. economy.&quot; Speaking as &quot;moral teachers&quot; rather than economists, the 
Bishops sought &quot;to lift up the human and ethical dimensions of economic life, aspects 
too often neglected in public discussion.&quot; </p>
