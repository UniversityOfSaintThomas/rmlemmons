<p><font FACE="Arial Black">Homework assignments: Each team member is to
read all the excerpts from the Nicomachean Ethics and post on the Internet
a response to the questions assigned to their team. (It is possible that
the answers to the following questions are scattered throughout the homework
readings.) Two comments should also be posted by Tuesday, 9 pm.</font>

<p><font FACE="Arial Black">Red Team (due Sat. 9 pm): (1) What is virtue?
(2) What is &quot;the mean'? (3) Why does Aristotle identify courage, temperance,
liberality, magnificence, proper pride, good-temperedness, truthfulness,
ready-wittedness, friendliness, modesty and righteous indignation as hitting
the mean?&nbsp; (4) Can any act hit the mean,&nbsp; or are some acts <i>always</i>
immoral?</font>

<p><font FACE="Arial Black">Green Team (due Sunday 9 pm):&nbsp; Morality
concerns voluntary acts. (1) Is every type of ignorance involuntary? (2)
Are all types of ignorance morally excusable, or does Aristotle argue that
it is possible to become wicked and unjust by acting from&nbsp; ignorance?
(3) Why does Aristotle identify acts done in anger or appetite (desire)
as voluntary?</font>

<p><font FACE="Arial Black">Blue Team (due Monday 9 pm): (1) According
to Aristotle why is the contemplation of God a better form of happiness
than acting morally? (2) What is the gist of&nbsp; Aristotle's Function
Argument? (3) Does morality require contemplating God? (4) Does Aristotle
agree with Plato that morality is pyschological health?</font>
