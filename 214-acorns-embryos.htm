                        vspace=2 border=0>he prestigious <I>New England Journal 
                        of Medicine</I> (<I>NEJM</I>) recently invited two 
                        members of the President’s Council on Bioethics to 
                        reflect on the ethics of using embryonic stem cells in 
                        biomedical research. Paul McHugh, a professor of 
                        psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University, explained his 
                        opposition to the destruction of human embryos created 
                        by the union of gametes, but sought to distinguish such 
                        embryos from what he dubbed “clonotes”: that is, embryos 
                        brought into being by cloning (a process known 
                        technically as “somatic cell nuclear transfer” or SCNT). 
                        He argued that human “clonotes” are not really human 
                        embryos, and thus do not enjoy the high moral status of 
                        embryos brought into being by ordinary sexual 
                        intercourse or by the process of in vitro fertilization 
                        (IVF). These “clonotes,” McHugh argued, may be 
                        legitimately destroyed for purposes of stem cell 
                        harvesting, so long as they are destroyed before the 
                        fourteenth day of their development. Michael Sandel, a 
                        professor of political theory at Harvard University, 
                        defended the killing of human embryos in biomedical 
                        research without regard to the method by which such 
                        embryos are brought into being. In his view, human 
                        embryos, whether produced by union of sperm and egg or 
                        by somatic cell nuclear transfer, are not entitled to 
                        the moral immunity against direct attack that is enjoyed 
                        by human beings at later developmental stages.
                        <P>Both McHugh and Sandel are leading figures in the 
                        embryo research debate, and the arguments they put 
                        forward are made frequently by others seeking moral 
                        grounds for engaging in the destruction of human 
                        embryos. But these arguments do not withstand critical 
                        examination. In our view, human beings in the embryonic 
                        stage are entitled to the same immunity from attack that 
                        is enjoyed by human beings at later developmental 
                        stages, and it is irrelevant whether these embryonic 
                        human beings came into existence by sexual union, in 
                        vitro fertilization, or somatic cell nuclear 
                        transfer.</P>

                        Dispute</FONT></B></P>
                        <P><B><FONT size=5>P</FONT></B>art of the problem we 
                        face is the way the issue has been framed by the editors 
                        of the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> and many 
                        others who have waded into the debate. Absent the 
                        appropriate framing of the issue, there is little 
                        likelihood of generating an illuminating public 
                        discussion.</P>
                        <P>If we were to contemplate killing mentally retarded 
                        infants to obtain transplantable organs, no one would 
                        characterize the resulting controversy as a debate 
                        “about organ transplantation.” The dispute would 
                        properly be characterized as a debate about the ethics 
                        of killing retarded children to harvest their vital 
                        organs. The issue could not be resolved by considering 
                        how many gravely ill non-retarded people could be saved 
                        by extracting a heart, two kidneys, and a liver from 
                        each retarded child. The threshold question would be 
                        whether it is unjust to relegate a certain class of 
                        human beings—the retarded—to the status of objects that 
                        can be killed and dissected to benefit others.</P>
                        <P>By the same token, we should not be speaking in terms 
                        of a debate “about embryonic stem cell research.” No one 
                        would object to the use of embryonic stem cells in 
                        biomedical research or therapy if they could be 
                        harvested without killing or harming the embryos from 
                        whom they were obtained. Nor would anyone object to 
                        using such cells if they could be obtained from embryos 
                        lost in spontaneous abortions. The point of controversy 
                        is the ethics of deliberately destroying human embryos 
                        for the purpose of harvesting their stem cells. The 
                        threshold question is whether it is unjust to kill 
                        members of a certain class of human beings—those in the 
                        embryonic stage of development—to benefit others.</P>
                        <P>But are human embryos human beings?</P>
                        <P>Indeed they are, and contemporary human embryology 
                        and developmental biology leave no significant room for 
                        doubt about it. The adult human being reading these 
                        words was, at an earlier stage of his or her life, an 
                        adolescent, and before that an infant. At still earlier 
                        stages he or she was a fetus and before that an embryo. 
                        In the infant, fetal, and embryonic stages, each of us 
                        was then what we are now, namely, a whole living member 
                        of the species <I>Homo sapiens</I>. Each of us developed 
                        by a gradual, unified, and self-directed process from 
                        the embryonic into and through the fetal, infant, child, 
                        and adolescent stages of human development, and into 
                        adulthood, with his or her determinateness, unity, and 
                        identity fully intact. Although none of us was ever a 
                        sperm cell or an ovum—the sperm and ovum from whose 
                        union we emerged were genetically and functionally parts 
                        of other human beings—each of us was once an embryo, 
                        just as we were once infants, children, and adolescents. 
                        In referring to “the embryo,” then, we are referring not 
                        to something distinct from the human being that each of 
                        us is, but rather to a certain stage in the development 
                        of each human being—like saying “the teenager” or “the 
                        five-year old.”</P>
                        <P>Some scientists and philosophers who agree with us 
                        about the status of human embryos as human beings 
                        nevertheless believe (mistakenly, in our view) that 
                        killing embryos in biomedical research can be justified. 
                        Some defend embryo-killing on utilitarian grounds, by 
                        asserting that killing a few thousand embryos today will 
                        help millions of suffering patients in the future. 
                        Others argue that no wrong is done in destroying “spare” 
                        IVF embryos that would otherwise be permanently frozen 
                        or discarded. There are, however, scholars who are 
                        prepared to deny that human embryos are human beings. 
                        Michael Sandel does just that in his <I>NEJM</I> 
                        article. He defends embryo-killing in biomedical 
                        research on the ground that human embryos and human 
                        beings are different <I>kinds</I> of entities.</P>

                          kind of loss as the death of an oak tree felled by a 
                          storm. Despite their developmental continuity, acorns 
                          and oak trees are different kinds of 
                        things.</SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
                        <P>Sandel maintains that, by analogy, embryos are 
                        different in <I>kind</I> from human beings. But this 
                        argument cannot survive scrutiny.</P>
                        <P>As Sandel himself implicitly concedes, <I>we value 
                        human beings precisely because of the kind of entities 
                        they are</I>. (That is why he has staked his entire 
                        argument on the proposition that human embryos are 
                        different <I>in kind </I>from human beings.) Indeed, 
                        that is why we consider all human beings to be equal in 
                        basic dignity and human rights. By contrast, we value 
                        oak trees because of certain accidental attributes they 
                        have, such as their magnificence, their special beauty, 
                        or a certain grandeur that has taken perhaps 
                        seventy-five or a hundred years to achieve. If oak trees 
                        <I>were</I> valuable in virtue of the <I>kind</I> of 
                        entity they are, then it <I>would</I> follow that it is 
                        just as unfortunate to lose an acorn as an oak tree 
                        (though our emotional reaction to the two different 
                        kinds of loss might, for a variety of possible reasons, 
                        nevertheless differ). Sandel’s purported analogy works 
                        only if he disregards the key proposition asserted by 
                        opponents of embryo-killing: that all human beings, 
                        irrespective of age, size, stage of development, or 
                        condition of dependency, possess equal and intrinsic 
                        dignity by virtue of <I>what</I> (i.e., <I>the kind</I> 
                        of entity) they are, not in virtue of any accidental 
                        characteristics, which can come and go, and which are 
                        present in human beings in varying degrees. Oak trees 
                        and acorns are not equally valuable, because the basis 
                        for their value is not <I>what</I> they are but 
                        precisely those accidental characteristics by which oak 
                        trees differ from acorns. We value the ugly, decaying 
                        oak tree less than the magnificent, still flourishing 
                        one; and we value the mature, magnificent oak more than 
                        the small, still growing one. But we would never say the 
                        same about human beings.</P>
                        <P class=MsoNormal style="LINE-HEIGHT: 14.15pt">Sandel’s 
                        argument begins to go awry with his choice of 
                        analogates. The acorn is analogous to the embryo and the 
                        oak tree (he says) is analogous to the “human being.” 
                        But in view of the developmental continuity that Sandel 
                        rightly concedes, surely the proper analogate of the oak 
                        tree is the mature human being, i.e., <I>the adult</I>. 
                        Of course, Sandel’s analogy has its force because we 
                        really do feel a sense of loss when a <I>mature</I> oak 
                        is felled. But while it is true that we do not feel the 
                        same sense of loss at the destruction of an acorn, <I>it 
                        is also true that we do not feel the same sense of loss 
                        at the destruction of an oak sapling</I>. (Indeed, our 
                        reaction to the destruction of a sapling is much more 
                        like our reaction to the destruction of an acorn than it 
                        is like our reaction to the destruction of a mature 
                        oak.) But clearly the oak tree does not differ <I>in 
                        kind</I> from the oak sapling. This shows that we value 
                        oak trees not because of the kind of entity they are, 
                        but rather because of their magnificence. Neither acorns 
                        nor saplings are magnificent, so we do not experience a 
                        sense of loss when they are destroyed.</P>
                        <P class=MsoNormal style="LINE-HEIGHT: 14.15pt">But the 
                        basis for our valuing human beings is profoundly 
                        different. We do not believe that especially magnificent 
                        human beings—such as Michael Jordan or Albert 
                        Einstein—are of greater inherent worth and dignity than 
                        human beings who are physically frail or mentally 
                        impaired. We would not tolerate the killing of a 
                        retarded child or a person suffering from, say, brain 
                        cancer in order to harvest transplantable organs to save 
                        Jordan or Einstein.</P>
                        <P>And we do not tolerate the killing of infants, which 
                        on Sandel’s analogy would be analogous to the oak 
                        saplings at whose destruction we feel no particular 
                        sense of loss. Managers of oak forests freely kill 
                        saplings, just as they might destroy acorns, to ensure 
                        the health of the more mature trees. No one regrets 
                        this, or gives it a second thought. This is precisely 
                        because we do not value members of the oak species—as we 
                        value human beings—because of the kind of entity they 
                        are. If we did value oaks for the kind of entity they 
                        are, and not for their magnificence, then we would 
                        likely feel a sense of loss at the destruction of 
                        saplings, and it would be reasonable to feel a similar 
                        sense of loss at the destruction of acorns. Conversely, 
                        if we valued human beings in a way analogous to that in 
                        which we value oak trees, then we would have no reason 
                        to object to killing human infants or even mature human 
                        beings who were severely “defective.”</P>
                        <P>In sum, Sandel’s defense of embryo-killing on the 
                        basis of an analogy between embryos and acorns collapses 
                        the moment one brings into focus the profound difference 
                        between the basis on which we value oak trees and the 
                        basis on which we ascribe intrinsic value and dignity to 
                        human beings. His analogy only makes sense if we reject 
                        the principle that all human beings possess equal moral 
                        worth—a principle that we assume Sandel wishes to 
                        uphold, not reject.</P>

                        <P><B><FONT size=5>S</FONT></B>andel’s argument also 
                        relies on an equivocation of the terms “oak tree” and 
                        “human being.” Of course, as Sandel says, acorns are not 
                        oak trees—<I>if</I> by “oak tree” one means a 
                        <I>mature</I> member of the oak species. By the same 
                        token, a sapling is not an “oak tree” if <I>that</I> is 
                        what one means (nor, by the same reasoning, is an infant 
                        a human being). But if by “oak tree” (or “oak”) one 
                        means simply any member of the <I>species</I>, then an 
                        acorn (or a sapling) <I>is</I> an oak tree—they are 
                        identical <I>substances</I>, differing only in maturity 
                        or stage of natural development.</P>
                        <P>Similarly, no one claims that embryos are 
                        <I>mature</I> human beings, that is, adults. But human 
                        embryos <I>are</I> human beings, that is, complete, 
                        though immature, members of the human species. Embryos 
                        are human individuals at an early stage of their 
                        development, just as adolescents, toddlers, infants, and 
                        fetuses are human individuals at various developmental 
                        stages. So to say, as Sandel does, that embryos and 
                        human beings are different <I>kinds</I> of things is 
                        true only if one focuses exclusively on the accidental 
                        characteristics—size, degree of development, and so on. 
                        But the central question is, precisely, should we focus 
                        only on the accidental characteristics by which 
                        embryonic human beings differ from mature human beings, 
                        or should we recognize their essential nature (that is, 
                        <I>what they are</I>)?</P>
                        <P>Sandel’s claim that human embryos are not human 
                        beings, or not “full human beings,” or merely “potential 
                        human life,” simply cannot be squared with the facts of 
                        human embryogenesis and developmental biology. Briefly, 
                        modern embryology shows the following: (1) The embryo is 
                        from the start <I>distinct</I> from any cell of the 
                        mother or the father, for it is growing in its own 
                        distinct direction and its growth is internally directed 
                        to its own survival and maturation. (2) The embryo is 
                        <I>human</I>, since it has the genetic constitution and 
                        epigenetic primordia characteristic of human beings. (3) 
                        Most importantly, the embryo is a <I>complete</I> or 
                        <I>whole</I> organism, though immature. From conception 
                        onward, the human embryo is fully programmed, and has 
                        the active disposition, to develop himself or herself to 
                        the next mature stage of a human being. And unless 
                        prevented by disease, violence, or a hostile 
                        environment, the embryo will actually do so, despite 
                        possibly significant variation in its circumstances 
                        (i.e., in the mother’s womb). None of the changes that 
                        occur to the embryo after fertilization, for as long as 
                        he or she survives, generates a new direction of growth. 
                        Rather, <I>all</I> of the changes (for example those 
                        involving nutrition and environment) either facilitate 
                        or retard the internally directed growth of this 
                        persisting individual.</P>

                        <P><B><FONT size=5>P</FONT></B>erhaps with these facts 
                        in mind, Sandel sometimes seems to consider that though 
                        human embryos are human beings as a matter of biological 
                        fact (for example, he says that an oak tree was once an 
                        acorn, which, by analogy, would mean that more mature 
                        human beings were once embryos), they are not 
                        <I>persons</I>. According to this position, which has 
                        been famously promoted by Peter Singer and Ronald 
                        Dworkin, although we were once human embryos, we were 
                        not persons at that time and were not entitled to the 
                        respect and protection against lethal violence due to 
                        persons. And when did we become persons? Sandel, like 
                        Singer and Dworkin, says that the important difference 
                        between human embryos and human persons is that persons 
                        are not only sentient but “capable of experience and 
                        consciousness,” and therefore “make higher claims” on us 
                        than beings who lack such capacities.</P>
                        <P>But personhood is <I>not</I> an accidental 
                        characteristic, that is, a characteristic which one 
                        acquires at some point after he exists and may lose at 
                        another point. One is a human person by being a living 
                        member of the human community, a member of the human 
                        species. It is true that many people cannot immediately 
                        exercise the rational capacities characteristic of 
                        members of the species—such as the elderly person with 
                        dementia whose rational powers are gone forever, or the 
                        comatose person whose rational powers may or may not 
                        return, or infants, fetuses, and embryos whose rational 
                        powers are still developing. But such individuals are 
                        still morally valuable persons, at least to those who 
                        value all human beings equally. They are still members 
                        of the human community. Being a person is not a result 
                        of acquired accidental attributes; rather, it is being a 
                        certain type of individual, an individual with a 
                        rational <I>nature</I>. And human beings are individuals 
                        with a rational nature at every stage of their 
                        existence. We come into being as individuals with a 
                        rational nature, and we do not cease being such 
                        individuals until we cease to be (by dying). We did not 
                        acquire a rational nature by achieving sentience or the 
                        immediately exercisable capacity for rational inquiry 
                        and deliberation. We were individuals with a rational 
                        nature even during the early childhood, infant, fetal, 
                        and embryonic stages of our lives. If we are persons 
                        <I>now</I>, we were persons <I>then</I>. We were never 
                        “human nonpersons.”</P>

                        <P><B><FONT size=5>S</FONT></B>andel’s final argument is 
                        that holding that a human embryo is a person has logical 
                        implications that either no one accepts or that are 
                        simply unacceptable. Those who hold that human embryos 
                        are persons, Sandel says, should be in favor of a total 
                        ban on the destruction of human embryos for research, 
                        not just a prohibition on federal funding. And they 
                        should be opposed to any fertility treatments that 
                        involve the creation and discarding of “excess” embryos.

                        practices—we are opposed to <I>all</I> dissecting or 
                        deliberate discarding of living human embryos. It is 
                        worth pointing out, though, that federal funding for the 
                        killing or discarding of human embryos (the matter now 
                        being debated) is worse than the failure to provide 
                        equal protection of the law to a class of human beings 
                        (the larger issue). If the government funds embryo 
                        destruction, then it is forcing us to participate, as 
                        members of the political community, in the killing of 
                        human beings. And while we would surely support a 
                        national ban on the deliberate destruction of any human 
                        embryo, we also seek to uphold those limits that can be 
                        preserved at present, while making the fundamental moral 
                        arguments about why additional limits are needed, and 
                        why other promising areas of research (like adult stem 
                        cells) should be pursued as morally desirable 
                        alternatives. It is better to prohibit the federal 
                        funding of embryo destruction than to prohibit nothing 
                        at all, even if it would be better still to prohibit the 
                        act of embryo destruction itself.</P>
                        <P>Sandel also points to the frequent occurrence of 
                        early spontaneous abortions, claiming that “more than 
                        half of all fertilized eggs either fail to implant or 
                        are otherwise lost.” He then says that “the way we 
                        respond to the natural loss of embryos suggests that we 
                        do not regard this event as the moral or religious 
                        equivalent of the death of infants.” There are, he 
                        points out, few burial rituals or mourning rites for the 
                        loss of an embryo. As a factual matter, Sandel somewhat 
                        exaggerates the rate of early pregnancy loss, with 
                        leading embryologists estimating a loss rate of roughly 
                        45 to 50 percent. Moreover, as almost all authorities in 
                        human embryology note, many of these unsuccessful 
                        pregnancies are really due to incomplete or defective 
                        fertilizations, and so in many cases, what is lost is 
                        not actually a human embryo. (To be a complete human 
                        organism, a human being, the entity must have the 
                        epigenetic primordia for a functioning brain and nervous 
                        system, which may be lacking as a result of a severe 
                        chromosomal defect.) But even if Sandel had the facts 
                        right, his argument here does not hold up. The absence 
                        of formal burial rites and (in many cases) intense 
                        mourning for the embryo who dies is explained by 
                        numerous considerations having nothing to do with 
                        whether human beings in the embryonic stage of 
                        development possess human dignity or intrinsic worth. 
                        Chief among these is the fact that people have not had 
                        the opportunity to bond emotionally with the human being 
                        who is lost at an early stage of development. As to the 
                        way we respond to miscarriages, Sandel is mistaken to 
                        assume it is uniform. Many people, women in particular, 
                        very often <I>do</I> grieve intensely when a miscarriage 
                        occurs, even when it is early in pregnancy.</P>
                        <P>In any event, someone’s status as a human being 
                        possessing dignity and intrinsic worth in no way depends 
                        on whether anyone would grieve for him or her after 
                        death. Emotional responses are notoriously limited in 
                        their capacity to function as sources of moral 
                        knowledge. The real question is whether human embryos 
                        are human beings, as we contend, or whether they are 
                        different <I>in kind</I> from human beings, as Sandel 
                        attempts to show by his analogy with acorns and oak 
                        trees. His argument succeeds only if the analogy holds. 
                        But the analogy fails dramatically. The dignity of human 
                        beings is <I>intrinsic</I> to the kind of entity we are; 
                        it does not depend on accidental attributes like size, 
                        skin color, age, or IQ. The value we accord to oak trees 
                        is <I>conditional</I>; it depends precisely on those 
                        accidental attributes, like size and beauty, that make 
                        some oaks more remarkable and thus more valuable than 
                        others. And so we object to killing human infants 
                        (though we experience no great feeling of loss at the 
                        destruction of saplings), and we should object to 
                        killing human embryos (though we feel no sense of loss 
                        at the trampling of acorns).</P>

                        gametes and those that are produced by somatic cell 
                        nuclear transfer? Even if human embryos are nothing 
                        other than embryonic human beings, as we argue and 
                        McHugh agrees, are “clonotes” something other than human 
                        embryos?</P>
                        <P>Here is McHugh’s argument in his own words:</P>
                        <BLOCKQUOTE>
                          <P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">I argue that in vitro 
                          fertilization entails the begetting of a new human 
                          being right from its start as a zygote and that we 
                          should use it to produce babies rather than cells or 
                          tissues to be harvested for purposes dictated by other 
                          human beings. In contrast, SCNT is a biologic 
                          manufacturing process that we may use to produce cells 
                          but should not use to produce 
                        babies.</SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
                        <P>The trouble with this argument is that the “cells” he 
                        seeks from SCNT are derived by creating and destroying a 
                        cloned human embryo. And the “clonote” and the embryo, 
                        despite the different processes by which they come into 
                        being, are indistinguishable in their essential nature. 
                        What McHugh rightly says about the in vitro 
                        fertilization process, namely, that it “creates a new 
                        human being right from its start as a zygote,” is also 
                        true of the entity produced by somatic cell nuclear 
                        transfer. All the biological characteristics of the 
                        embryo are to be found in the “clonote.” Indeed, there 
                        is no point in inventing a new word. As the vast 
                        majority of people on both sides of the ethical debate 
                        understand perfectly well, what somatic cell nuclear 
                        transfer produces is a cloned <I>embryo</I>.</P>
                        <P>McHugh says that his “distinction rests on the origin 
                        of cells in SCNT, not on the process’s vaunted potential 
                        for producing a living replica (clone) of the donor, as 
                        with Dolly the sheep.” But, of course, Dolly the sheep 
                        began her life as an embryonic sheep. She did not skip 
                        the embryonic stage. In this respect, she was 
                        indistinguishable from other sheep. Similarly, a human 
                        adult brought into existence by somatic cell nuclear 
                        transfer would begin his life as a human embryo. The 
                        potential he fulfilled—namely, the potential to develop 
                        from the embryonic into and through the fetal, infant, 
                        child, and adolescent stages, and into adulthood—would 
                        be the potential he possessed from the embryonic stage 
                        forward. (Indeed, it is inaccurate to say that the 
                        embryonic Dolly had the “potential” to be a living 
                        replica of the sheep from which she was cloned. From the 
                        embryonic stage forward she <I>was</I> a living replica 
                        of that sheep.) Just as the life of a new human being 
                        conceived by sexual union develops by a gradual and 
                        gapless process during which the developing human never 
                        changes from one kind of entity into another, so too the 
                        life of a human being produced by somatic cell nuclear 
                        transfer would unfold without what philosophers call 
                        “substantial change” (i.e., a change from one kind of 
                        entity into another). In the life of such a being, there 
                        would be no point from the embryonic stage forward at 
                        which one could say that the developing being changed 
                        from a nonhuman entity into a human being. From the 
                        point at which SCNT succeeded in producing a distinct, 
                        self-integrating organism, a new human being 
existed.</P>
                        <P>McHugh attempts to support his position with an 
                        argument in the form of a <I>reductio ad absurdum</I>: 
                        “if one used the notion of ‘potential’ to protect cells 
                        developed through SCNT because with further manipulation 
                        they might become a living clone, then every somatic 
                        cell would deserve some protection because it has the 
                        potential to follow the same path.” But this argument 
                        fails. Somatic cells that may be used in cloning are 
                        analogous not to embryos, but to gametes. Functionally, 
                        they are parts of other human beings. They are not 
                        distinct, complete, self-integrating organisms. They are 
                        not living members of the species <I>Homo sapiens</I>. 
                        Embryos—however produced—are.</P>
                        <P>In fact, McHugh’s own argument is vulnerable to a 
                        <I>reductio ad absurdum</I>: if a “clonote” is not an 
                        embryonic member of the species of the animal from which 
                        it is cloned, then even in the adult stage the cloned 
                        entity cannot be a member of that species. By this 
                        reasoning, Dolly was in fact <I>not</I> a sheep, and the 
                        child, and later adult, who began life as a “clonote” 
                        would <I>not</I> be a human being. But that is 
                        absurd.</P>
                        <P>McHugh has one more argument. Relying on testimony 
                        given by Rudolf Jaenisch at the July 24, 2003 meeting of 
                        the President’s Council on Bioethics, McHugh asserts 
                        that “SCNT performed with primate cells produces embryos 
                        with such severe epigenetic problems that they cannot 
                        survive to birth.” The first thing to notice about this 
                        assertion is that it concedes that the entities produced 
                        by SCNT are, in fact, embryos, albeit severely disabled 
                        ones. More importantly, Jaenisch’s testimony does 
                        nothing to prove that disabled or “defective” embryos 
                        lack moral worth. As we mentioned above, in some cases 
                        reproduction fails because fertilization is incomplete, 
                        and in such a case there is a growth (for example, a 
                        complete hydatidiform mole) but there is not a human 
                        embryo. But if SCNT is successful then it generates a 
                        distinct organism with the full genetic program and 
                        active disposition to develop itself in accord with that 
                        program (even if it also has a defect which will cause 
                        its early death). There are newborn infants who, as a 
                        result of genetic diseases, are destined to die in a 
                        matter of days or even hours. This fact does not alter 
                        their status as human beings. It would be scandalous to 
                        suppose that it authorizes us to treat afflicted 
                        children as impersonal collections of organs available 
                        for transplantation and research.</P>
                        <P>Human beings may be severely afflicted at any 
                        developmental stage, from the embryonic to the adult. 
                        All of us will eventually die, and many of us will die 
                        as a result of factors in our genetic makeup from the 
                        point at which we came into being. From the moral 
                        viewpoint, the certainty of death—whether in ninety 
                        years or nine minutes—does not alter our inherent 
                        dignity or relieve others of the obligation to respect 
                        our lives. That someone will soon die, no matter what we 
                        do, is never a license for killing him. That the human 
                        being whose death is imminent happens to be at an 
                        earlier rather than later stage of development is 
                        morally irrelevant. Cloned human embryos are still 
                        embryonic human beings, and the fact that this 
                        particular way of initiating human life (SCNT) might 
                        harm human life does not give us a license to destroy 
                        cloned embryos or a reason to pretend that these living 
                        organisms are mere artifacts.</P>

                        Paul McHugh, we desire to see biomedical science advance 
                        towards therapies and cures for diseases. Our objection 
                        is not to embryonic stem cell research as such, but to 
                        the killing of embryonic human beings to harvest their 
                        stem cells. We support research using stem cells that 
                        can be obtained harmlessly from bone marrow, fat, and 
                        other non-embryonic sources. The day may well come—and 
                        come soon—when it is possible to obtain embryonic stem 
                        cells without killing embryos. It is likely that at some 
                        point in the future scientists will be able to reprogam 
                        adult cells back to the embryonic stage. Even sooner, it 
                        may be possible to create non-embryonic entities, 
                        analogous to complete hydatidiform moles and teratomas, 
                        from which embryonic-type stem cells may be obtained. 
                        When that day comes, we will enthusiastically support 
                        research using these cells.&nbsp; Now and always, 
                        though, we believe that biomedical science must remain 
                        faithful to the moral norm against killing in the cause 
                        of healing. To fail in fidelity to this norm is to 
                        undermine the moral foundations of the very enterprise 
                        of biomedical science. We must not allow our desire for 
                        scientific advancements, and even for therapies and 
                        cures, to cloud our judgments as to what human embryos 
                        are and what it means for us deliberately to kill 
                        them.</P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"
