philosophy but who are willing to put themselves into the dialogue and think 
along with Socrates and his interlocutors. It may take several readings to get 
the feel for this kind of discourse. Plato choose the dialogue format because he 
didn't want to tell the reader what he thought was true; rather, he wanted to 
get the reader to discover the truth by entering into the conversation. Good

<p><b><font size="3">In the <i>Republic</i>, Plato uses two famous images to 
illustrate the dependency of physical things upon their unchangeable forms and 
especially upon the form of goodness. To understand a nature ultimately means to 
understand its goodness. <i>Rep. </i>505a: &quot;the greatest thing is [to understand 
goodness, for it makes] just things and all the rest become useful and 
beneficial.&quot; This understanding cannot be drawn from considering how things 
change and are perceived. Nor is it accessible to those who seek pleasure and 
understanding from changing things. Why not?</p>
</font><font size="3">
<p>Read pp. 305-311 in <i>Republic</i> 505a-511e. Identify the similarities 
between the sun and the form of goodness. N.B. The illustration of the Divided 
Line should be vertical not horizontal.</p>
<p>Read pp. 312-323 <i>Rep</i>. 514a-523c: 1) In what way is the firelight in 
the cave like the sunlight outside of the cave? 2) Can those chained in the cave 
ever discover the truth about the shadows by the study of the shadows? 3) Does 
this mean that Plato was convinced that we can never discover the truth about 
physical things by studying them? 4) What must be known to understand the truth 
about the statues carried in the cave? 5) What must be known in order to 
understand the truth about the physical things that we encounter with our 
bodies? 6) Are any similarities between the Allegory of the Cave and the Divided 
Line? 7) Why isn’t the philosopher’s return to the Cave greeted with joy? 8) Is 
it unjust to require the philosopher to return to the cave and rule? 9) Were 
King Henry, Thomas More (as chancellor), King Arthur, and Malagant, philosopher 
kings? 10) Should we require our rulers to be philosophers in the way that Plato 
recommends? </p>

<font size="3">
<p>1) Read pp. 337-340 (537e-540d). Consider that Plato characterized philosophy 
to be a method, called dialectic, that is put in service of the <i>good</i>; to 
use the method apart from seeking the good corrupts those who would be 
philosophers and causes lawlessness – why? </p>
<p>2) Read pp. 360-3 (558d-564a) . Why does Plato argue that democracy’s 
emphasis upon freedom breeds licentiousness and tyranny?</p>
<p>3) Plato uses the Allegory of the Cave to argue that education is not the 
transfer of knowledge but a turning of the soul’s attention. Do you agree? Plato 
argues that the philosophical soul turns from the life of physicality to the 
life of the mind because it is puzzled by the ability of physical things to 
change. What is it about change that is so puzzling? Why does change require the 
unchangeable forms?Thomas Aquinas.</p>
<p>Aquinas disagrees with Plato’s argument that the truth about things can only 
be known from external forms. Like Aristotle, Aquinas argues that the truth 
about the nature of things can be discovered by studying things that are sensed. 
For this reason, Aquinas has an Aristotelian epistemology. Read in the course 
packet &quot;Aquinas on Knowledge.&quot; Answer the question that introduces each article 
and identify the main premise that supports the answer that you identified.</p>

These are difficult pages in which Socrates attempts to defeat Cebes’ argument 
by talking about the importance of causes and about the need for a substratum to 
underlie changes between opposites. For example, a cold pan of water turns into 
its opposite of hot water only because water is a substratum capable of being 
hot or cold and because water does not cause its own temperature. If water was 
the cause of its own heat, then the outside temperature would not make it cold. 
This would mean that water would not become hot then cold, cold then hot. It 
would always be hot. Likewise, since the soul is the cause of its own life, the 
soul cannot be a substratum capable of becoming dead and then alive, alive and 
then dead. This argument from causality refutes the earlier argument from 
opposites.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P><BR>

In these articles, Thomas Aquinas used Platonic insights to counter

Aristotelian hylomorphism to explain the soul-body relationship. Focus your 
reading on answering the questions used to introduce the articles, and identify 
the key reason in support of your answer. N.B. Aquinas uses the idea that we can 
determine a thing’s nature from considering its activities. The activity most

Notice the breadth of objections used by Aquinas to contrast his own positions. 
Aquinas was very interested in truth and he was convinced that no error is 
totally devoid of insight. Philosophers who intentionally ignore arguments in 
order to make their own arguments look stronger are guilty of cowardice. Their 
arguments are unpersuasive since they do not refute viable alternatives.
