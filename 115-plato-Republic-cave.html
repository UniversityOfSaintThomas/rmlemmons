<br>
And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is
enlightened or unenlightened: &#8212; Behold! human beings living in a
underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching
all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have
their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see
before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their
heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and
between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will
see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which
marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the
puppets.<br>
<br>
I see.<br>
<br>
And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts
of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone
and various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are
talking, others silent.<br>
<br>
You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.<br>
<br>
Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the
shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of
the cave?<br>
<br>
True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were
never allowed to move their heads?<br>
<br>
And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would
only see the shadows?<br>
<br>
Yes, he said.<br>
<br>
And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not
suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?<br>
<br>
Very true.<br>
<br>
And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the
other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by
spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?<br>
<br>
No question, he replied.<br>
<br>
To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows
of the images.<br>
<br>
That is certain.<br>
<br>
And now look again, and see what will naturally follow it^ the
prisoners are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any
of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his
neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp
pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the
realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and
then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an
illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his
eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision, &#8212;
what will be his reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor
is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,
&#8212; will he not be perplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows which he
formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?<br>
<br>
Far truer.<br>
<br>
And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have
a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in
the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to
be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?<br>
<br>
True, he said.<br>
<br>
And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and
rugged ascent, and held fast until he 's forced into the presence of
the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When he
approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able
to see anything at all of what are now called realities.<br>
<br>
Not all in a moment, he said.<br>
<br>
He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world. And
first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and
other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he
will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled
heaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the
sun or the light of the sun by day?<br>
<br>
Certainly.<br>
<br>
Last of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of him
in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not in
another; and he will contemplate him as he is.<br>
<br>
Certainly.<br>
<br>
He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and
the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and
in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have
been accustomed to behold?<br>
<br>
Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.<br>
<br>
And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den
and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate
himself on the change, and pity them?<br>
<br>
Certainly, he would.<br>
<br>
And if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on
those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark
which of them went before, and which followed after, and which were
together; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to
the future, do you think that he would care for such honours and
glories, or envy the possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,<br>
<br>
and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after
their manner?<br>
<br>
Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than
entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.<br>
<br>
Imagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the sun
to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have
his eyes full of darkness?<br>
<br>
To be sure, he said.<br>
<br>
And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the
shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while
his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and
the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might
be very considerable) would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him
that up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was
better not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose
another and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender,
and they would put him to death.<br>
<br>
No question, he said.<br>
<br>
This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to the
previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of
the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret
the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual
world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have
expressed whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or
false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the idea of good </span>appears last of
all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> is also inferred to be the universal
author of all things beautiful and right, parent of light and of the
lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason
and truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon which he
who would act rationally, either in public or private life must have
his eye fixed.</span><br>
<br>
I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.<br>
<br>
Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this
beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their
souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to
dwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be
trusted.<br>
<br>
Yes, very natural.<br>
<br>
And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine
contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a
ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has
become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight
in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows
of images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of
those who have never yet seen absolute justice?<br>
<br>
Anything but surprising, he replied.<br>
<br>
Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of
the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from
coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of
the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who
remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak,
will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of
man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because
unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is
dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in his
condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he
have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light,
there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him
who returns from above out of the light into the den.<br>
<br>
That, he said, is a very just distinction.<br>
<br>
But then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong
when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not
there before, like sight into blind eyes.<br>
<br>
They undoubtedly say this, he replied.<br>
<br>
Whereas, our argument shows that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> the
power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already</span>; and
that just as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to light without
the whole body, so too <span style="font-weight: bold;">the instrument
of knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from
the world of becoming </span>into that of being, and learn by degrees
to endure the sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being,
or in other words, of the good.<br>
<br>
Very true.<br>
<br>
And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the
easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for
that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is
looking away from the truth?<br>
<br>
Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed.<br>
<br>
And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to
bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can
be implanted later by habit and exercise, the of wisdom more than
anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by
this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other
hand, hurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow
intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue &#8212; how eager
he is, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the
reverse of blind, but his keen eyesight is forced into the service of
evil, and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness.<br>
<br>
Very true, he said.<br>
<br>
But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days
of their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures,
such as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached
to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of
their souls upon the things that are below &#8212; if, I say, they had been
released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,
the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as
they see what their eyes are turned to now.<br>
<br>
Very likely.<br>
<br>
Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely. or rather a
necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated
and uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of
their education, will be able ministers of State; not the former,
because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their
actions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will
not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already
dwelling apart in the islands of the blest.<br>
<br>
Very true, he replied.<br>
<br>
Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State will
be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have
already shown to be the greatest of all &#8212; they must continue to ascend
until they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen
enough we must not allow them to do as they do now.<br>
<br>
What do you mean?<br>
<br>
I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be
allowed; t<span style="font-weight: bold;">hey must be made to descend
again</span> among the prisoners in the den, and partake of their
labours and honours, whether they are worth having or not.<br>
<br>
But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life,
when they might have a better?<br>
<br>
You have again forgotten, my friend, I said,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> the intention of the legislator, who did
not aim at making any one class in the State happy above the rest; the
happiness was to be in the whole State,</span> and he held the citizens
together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors of the
State, and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end he created
them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in binding up
the State.<br>
<br>
True, he said, I had forgotten.<br>
<br>
Observe, Glaucon, that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> there will be
no injustice in compelling our philosophers to have a care and
providence of others;</span> we shall explain to them that in other
States, men of their class are not obliged to share in the toils of
politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up at their own sweet
will, and the government would rather not have them. Being self-taught,
they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they
have never received. But we have brought you into the world to be
rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the other citizens, and
have educated you far better and more perfectly than they have been
educated, and you are better able to share in the double duty.
Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the general
underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. When you
have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times better than
the inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the several images
are, and what they represent, because you have seen the beautiful and
just and good in their truth. And thus our State which is also yours
will be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be administered in a
spirit unlike that of other States, in which men fight with one another
about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power, which
in their eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth is that the State in
which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and
most quietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager, the
worst.<br>
<br>
Quite true, he replied.<br>
<br>
And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at
the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of
their time with one another in the heavenly light?<br>
<br>
Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which
we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of
them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion
of our present rulers of State.<br>
<br>
Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive for
your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and
then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which
offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold,
but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas
if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering
after their own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to
snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they will be
fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus
arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.<br>
<br>
Most true, he replied.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And the only life which looks down
upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy. </span>Do
you know of any other?<br>
<br>
Indeed, I do not, he said.<br>
<br>
And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they
are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.<br>
<br>
No question.<br>
<br>
Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they
will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the
State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours
and another and a better life than that of politics?<br>
<br>
They are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.<br>
<br>
<br>
And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced,
and how they are to be brought from darkness to light, &#8212; as some are
said to have ascended from the world below to the gods?<br>
<br>
By all means, he replied.<br>
<br>
The process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell,1 but
the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better
than night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below,
which we affirm to be true philosophy?<br>
<br>
Quite so.<br>
<br>
And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of
effecting such a change?<br>
<br>
Certainly.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What sort of knowledge is there which
would draw the soul from becoming to being? <br>
<br>
. . . .</span>. . . <br>
<br>
I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">some of them do not invite thought because
the sense is an adequate judge of them; while in the case of other
objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is imperatively
demanded.</span><br>
<br>
You are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses
are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.<br>
<br>
No, I said, that is not at all my meaning.<br>
<br>
Then what is your meaning?<br>
<br>
When speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not pass
from one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which
do; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a
distance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular
than of its opposite. An illustration will make my meaning clearer: &#8212;
here are three fingers &#8212; a little finger, a second finger, and a middle
finger.<br>
<br>
Very good.<br>
. . . .<br>
But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason
will have the knowledge which we require of them?<br>
<br>
Neither can this be supposed.<br>
<br>
And so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">dialectic.</span> This is that strain which
is of the intellect only, but which the faculty of sight will
nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight, as you may remember, was
imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars, and
last of all the sun himself. And so with dialectic; when a person
starts on the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only,
and without any assistance of sense, and perseveres until by pure
intelligence he arrives at the perception of the absolute good, he at
last finds himself at the end of the intellectual world, as in the case
of sight at the end of the visible.<br>
<br>
Exactly, he said.<br>
<br>
Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?<br>
<br>
True.<br>
<br>
But the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation
from the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from
the underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly
trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are
able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water
(which are divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows
of images cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only
an image) &#8212; this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul
to the contemplation of that which is best in existence, with which we
may compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the
body to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and
visible world &#8212; this power is given, as I was saying, by all that study
and pursuit of the arts which has been described.<br>
<br>
I agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to
believe, yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny.
This, however, is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but
will have to be discussed again and again. And so, whether our
conclusion be true or false, let us assume all this, and proceed at
once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain,2 and describe
that in like manner. Say, then, what is the nature and what are the
divisions of dialectic, and what are the paths which lead thither; for
these paths will also lead to our final rest?<br>
<br>
Dear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, though I
would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the
absolute truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would
or would not have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would
have seen something like reality; of that I am confident.<br>
<br>
Doubtless, he replied.<br>
<br>
But I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can
reveal this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.<br>
<br>
Of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.<br>
<br>
And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of
comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of
ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in
general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are
cultivated with a view to production and construction, or for the
preservation of such productions and constructions; and as to the
mathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some apprehension
of true being &#8212; geometry and the like &#8212;<span style="font-weight: bold;">
they only dream about being, but never can they behold the waking
reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they use unexamined,
and are unable to give an account of them. For when a man knows not his
own first principle, </span>and when the conclusion and intermediate
steps are also constructed out of he knows not what, how can he imagine
that such a fabric of convention can ever become science?<br>
<br>
Impossible, he said.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Then dialectic, and dialectic alone,
goes directly to the first principle </span>and is the only science
which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure; the
eye of the soul, which is literally buried in an outlandish slough, is
by her gentle aid lifted upwards; and she uses as handmaids and helpers
in the work of conversion, the sciences which we have been discussing.
Custom terms them sciences, but they ought to have some other name,
implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than
science: and this, in our previous sketch, was called understanding.
But why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such
importance to consider?<br>
<br>
Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought
of the mind with clearness?<br>
<br>
At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two
for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division
science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth
perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and
intellect with being; and so to make a proportion:<br>
<br>
As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. And as
intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to
the perception of shadows.<br>
<br>
But let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the
subjects of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry,
many times longer than this has been.<br>
<br>
As far as I understand, he said, I agree.<br>
<br>
And do you also agree, I said, in describing <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the dialectician as one who attains a
conception of the essence of each thing</span>? And he who does not
possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever
degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in
intelligence? Will you admit so much?<br>
<br>
Yes, he said; how can I deny it?<br>
<br>
And you would say the same of the conception of the good? Until the
person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good, and
unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to
disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never
faltering at any step of the argument &#8212; unless he can do all this, you
would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he
apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion
and not by science; &#8212; dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he
is well awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final
quietus.<br>
<br>
In all that I should most certainly agree with you.<br>
. . . . .<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">And here, my friend, great
caution is required.</span><br>
<br>
Why great caution?<br>
<br>
Do you not remark, I said, how <span style="font-weight: bold;">great
is the evil which dialectic has introduce</span>d?<br>
<br>
What evil? he said.<br>
<br>
T<span style="font-weight: bold;">he students of the art are filled
with lawlessness.</span><br>
<br>
Quite true, he said.<br>
<br>
Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in
their case? or will you make allowance for them?<br>
<br>
In what way make allowance?<br>
<br>
I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son
who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous
family, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he learns
that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he is
unable to discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave
towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during
the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again
when he knows? Or shall I guess for you?<br>
<br>
If you please.<br>
<br>
Then I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be
likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations
more than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when
in need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less
willing to disobey them in any important matter.<br>
<br>
He will.<br>
<br>
But when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would
diminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted
to the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he
would now live after their ways, and openly associate with them, and,
unless he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble
himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations.<br>
<br>
Well, all that is very probable. But<span style="font-weight: bold;">
how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
In this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice
and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental
authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.<br>
<br>
That is true.<br>
<br>
There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and
attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense
of right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their
fathers.<br>
<br>
True.<br>
<br>
Now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what
is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him,
and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is
driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than
dishonourable, or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of
all the notions which he most valued, do you think that he will still
honour and obey them as before?<br>
<br>
Impossible.<br>
<br>
And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore,
and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any
life other than that which flatters his desires?<br>
<br>
He cannot.<br>
<br>
And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of
it? Unquestionably.<br>
<br>
Now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have
described, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.<br>
<br>
Yes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.<br>
<br>
Therefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our
citizens who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in
introducing them to dialectic.<br>
<br>
Certainly.<br>
<br>
There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early;
for youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste
in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and
refuting others in imitation of those who refute them;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> like puppy-dogs, they rejoice in pulling
and tearing at all who come near them.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Yes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.<br>
<br>
And when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the
hands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not
believing anything which they believed before, and hence, not only
they, but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad
name with the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
Too true, he said.<br>
<br>
But when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such
insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth,
and not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement;
and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of
diminishing the honour of the pursuit.<br>
<br>
Very true, he said.<br>
<br>
And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the
disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now,
any chance aspirant or intruder?<br>
<br>
Very true.<br>
. . . .<br>
And how long is this stage of their lives to last?<br>
. . . . and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> when they have reached
fifty years of age,</span> then let those who still survive and have
distinguished themselves in every action of their lives and in every
branch of knowledge come at last to their consummation; the time has
now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the
universal light which lightens all things, and behold the absolute
good; for that is the, pattern according to which they are to order the
State and the lives of individuals, and the remainder of their own
lives also; making philosophy their chief pursuit, but, when their turn
comes, toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good, not as
though they were performing some heroic action, but simply as a matter
of duty; and when they have brought up in each generation others like
themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the State,
then they will depart to the Islands of the Blest and dwell there; and
the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour
them, if the Pythian oracle consent, as demi-gods, but if not, as in
any case blessed and divine.<br>
<br>
You are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our governors
faultless in beauty.<br>
<br>
Yes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not
suppose that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to
women as far as their natures can go.<br>
<br>
There you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in all
things like the men.<br>
<br>
Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has been
said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and
although difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which
has been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are
born in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this
present world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all
things right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding
justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose
ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when
they set in order their own city?<br>
<br>
How will they proceed?<br>
<br>
They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of
the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of
their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents;
these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws
which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of
which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness,
and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.<br>
<br>
Yes, that will be the best way. And I think, Socrates, that you have
very well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into
being.<br>
<br>
Enough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its image &#8212;
there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.<br>
<br>
There is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in thinking
that nothing more need be said.<br>
