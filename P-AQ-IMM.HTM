<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><STRONG>ON THE SOUL'S IMMATERIALITY AND EXISTENCE </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I.75.1: WHETHER THE SOUL IS IMMATERIAL? </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>N.B. The way in which Aquinas argues for the soul's immateriality identifies his philosophy as
hylomorphic. Hylomorphism teaches that the soul activates matter into a living body.</EM></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>OBJ 3: Further, between the mover and the moved there must be contact. But contact is
only between bodies. Since, therefore, the soul moves the body, it seems that the soul must
be a material body.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I answer that, To seek the nature of the soul, we must premise that the soul is defined as the
first principle of life of those things which live: for we call living things "animate," [*i.e.
having a soul], and those things which have no life, "inanimate." Now life is shown
principally by two actions, knowledge and movement. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>The philosophers of old</EM> . . . supposed that the principle of these actions was something
corporeal: for they asserted that only bodies were real things; and that what is not
corporeal is nothing: hence they maintained that the soul is something corporeal. This
opinion can be proved to be false in many ways; but we shall make use of only one proof,
based on universal and certain principles, which shows clearly that the soul is not a body. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Now, though matter may be a principle of life as the heart is a principle of life in an animal,
nothing material can be the first principle of life. For it is clear that to be a principle of life,
or to be alive, does not belong to matter as such; since, if that were the case, all material
things would be alive. Therefore matter---which is able to be a living thing or even a
principle of life---is as such only <EM>potentially</EM> a living body. When it is <EM>actually</EM> a body, some
principle must be activating its potency for being a living body. [That principle of
activation is the soul.] Accordingly, the soul as the first principle of life [does not consists of
matter; it is rather immaterial so that it can animate matter into a living body.] </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 3: [Not all contact is between bodies.] There are two kinds of contact; of
"quantity," and of "power." By the former a body can be touched only by a body; by the
latter a body can be touched by an incorporeal thing, which moves that body. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I.75.2: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS SOMETHING SUBSISTENT? </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>N.B. Since subsistence means to exist on one's own, this article is asking whether the human
soul has the type of existence that enables it to exist on its own, i.e. independently of matter. If
the human soul does not subsist, then its existence relies upon matter and ceases when the
body is unable to sustain life.</EM></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>ARTICLE COMMENTARY: In this article Aquinas relies upon the principle that ACTION
FOLLOWS EXISTENCE, i.e. a thing acts according to its mode of existence. Thus, if the
intellect has an act that is independent of matter, then it must exist independently of matter (it
must be its own subsistence). The intellect has such an act because its ability to know all
material things presupposes that it does not consists of matter; the intellect is not the brain.
This article thus presents a key argument against materialism. </EM></STRONG><EM></EM></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>Another argument based upon Thomistic principles is that since matter is the principle of
individuation, universals can neither exist in matter nor be known by a material entity.
Therefore, the intellectual soul which knows universals cannot be material. See I.75.5 for
Aquinas' more detailed argument. </EM></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>OBJ 3: Further, if the soul were subsistent, it would have some operation apart from the
body. But it has no operation apart from the body, not even that of understanding: for the
act of understanding does not take place without a <EM>sense image</EM>, which cannot exist apart
from the body. Therefore the human soul is not something subsistent. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I answer that, It must necessarily be allowed that the principle of intellectual operation
which we call the soul, is a principle both incorporeal and subsistent. For it is clear that by
means of the intellect man can have knowledge of all corporeal things. Now whatever knows
certain things cannot have any of them in its own nature; because that which is in it
naturally would impede the knowledge of anything else. Thus we observe that . . . [none can
sense the temperature of water when the hand is as warm as the water]. Hence, if the
intellectual principle contained the nature of a body it would be unable to know all bodies.
Therefore, since every body has its own determinate nature, it is impossible for the
intellectual principle to be a body. It is likewise impossible for it to understand by means of
a bodily organ; since the determinate nature of that organ would impede knowledge of all
bodies; as when a certain determinate color is not only in the pupil of the eye, but also in a
glass vase, the liquid in the vase seems to be of that same color. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Therefore the intellectual principle which we call the mind or the intellect has an operation
in and through itself apart from the body. Now only that which subsists can have an
operation in and through itself. For nothing can operate but what is actual: for which
reason we do not say that heat imparts heat, but that what is hot gives heat. We must
conclude, therefore, that the human soul, which is called the intellect or the mind, is
something incorporeal and subsistent. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 3: The body is necessary for the action of the intellect, not as its origin of action,
but on the part of the object; for the sense image is to the intellect what color is to the sight.
Neither does such a dependence on the body prove the intellect to be non-subsistent;
otherwise it would follow that an animal is non-subsistent, since it requires external objects
of the senses in order to perform its act of perception. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I.75.3: WHETHER THE SOULS OF BRUTE ANIMALS ARE SUBSISTENT? </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>N.B. If animal souls are subsistent, then it would be possible for animals to be immortal.</EM></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>OBJ 1: It would seem that the souls of brute animals are subsistent. For man is of the same
'genus' as other animals; and, as we have just shown (A2), the soul of man is subsistent.
Therefore the souls of other animals are subsistent. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>OBJ 3: Further, the soul of brute animals moves the body. But the body is not a mover, but
is moved. Therefore the soul of brute animals has an operation apart from the body. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I answer that, <EM>The ancient philosophers</EM> made no distinction between sense and intellect,
and referred both to a corporeal principle, as has been said (A1). <EM>Plato</EM>, however, drew a
distinction between intellect and sense; yet he referred both to an incorporeal principle,
maintaining that sensing, just as understanding, belongs to the soul as such. From this it
follows that even the souls of brute animals are subsistent. But <EM>Aristotle</EM> held that of the
operations of the soul, understanding alone is performed without a corporeal organ. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>On the other hand</EM>, sensation and the consequent operations of the sensitive soul are
evidently accompanied with change in the body; thus in the act of vision, the pupil of the
eye is affected by a reflection of color: and so with the other senses. Hence it is clear that the
sensitive soul has no act in and through itself, and that every operation of the sensitive soul
belongs to the composite. Therefore we conclude that since the souls of brute animals have
no acts in and through themselves, they are not subsistent. For the operation of anything
follows the mode of its being. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 1: Although man is of the same "genus" as other animals, he is of a different
"species." Specific difference is derived from the difference of form; nor does every
difference of form necessarily imply a diversity of "genus." </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 3: Motive power is of <EM>two</EM> kinds. <EM>One</EM>, the appetitive power, commands motion.
The operation of this power in the sensitive soul is not apart from the body; for anger, joy,
and passions of a like nature are accompanied by a change in the body. The <EM>other</EM> motive
power is that which executes motion in adapting the members for obeying the appetite; and
the act of this power does not consist in moving, but in being moved. Whence it is clear that
to move is not an act of the sensitive soul without the body. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I.75.4: WHETHER THE SOUL IS MAN? </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>N.B. If Aquinas would argue that the soul is man, then Aquinas would hold the same position
as Plato.</EM></STRONG> <STRONG><EM>Moreover, if the soul is man, then the transmigration of the human soul into another
body would be possible. Accordingly, this article is important not only because it differentiates
Aquinas from Plato but also because its emphasis upon the importance of matter to human
nature strengthens our understanding of Thomistic hylomorphism. </EM></STRONG><EM></EM></P>

<P><STRONG>OBJ 1: It would seem that the soul is man. For it is written (2 Cor. 4:16): "Though our
outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." But that which is
within man is the soul. Therefore the soul is the inward man. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>ON THE CONTRARY</EM>, Augustine (De Civ. Dei xix, 3) commends Varro as holding "that
man is not a mere soul, nor a mere body; but both soul and body." </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I answer that, The assertion "the soul is man," can be taken in <EM>two</EM> senses. <EM>First</EM>, that man is
a soul; though this particular man, Socrates, for instance, is not a soul, but composed of
soul and body. I say this, for as much as some held that the form alone belongs to the
species; while matter is part of the individual, and not the species. This cannot be true; for
to the nature of the species belongs what the definition signifies; and in natural things the
definition does not signify the form only, but the form and the matter. Hence in natural
things the matter is part of the species; not, indeed, <EM>signate matter</EM>, which is the principle of
individuality; but the <EM>common matter</EM>. For as it belongs to the notion of this particular man
to be composed of this soul, of this flesh, and of these bones; so it belongs to the notion of
man to be composed of soul, flesh, and bones; for whatever belongs in common to the
substance of all the individuals contained under a given species, must belong to the
substance of the species. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>It may also be understood in this sense, that this soul is this man; and this could be held if it
were supposed that the operation of the sensitive soul were proper to it, apart from the
body; because in that case all the operations which are attributed to man would belong to
the soul only; and whatever performs the operations proper to a thing, is that thing;
therefore that which performs the operations of a man is man. But it has been shown above
(A3) that sensation is not the operation of the soul only. Since, then, sensation is an
operation of man, but not proper to him, it is clear that man is not a soul only, but
something composed of soul and body. <EM>Plato</EM>, through supposing that sensation was proper
to the soul, could maintain man to be a soul making use of the body. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 1: According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix, 8), a thing seems to be chiefly what is
principle in it; thus what the governor of a state does, the state is said to do. In this way
sometimes what is principle in man is said to be man; sometimes, indeed, the intellectual
part which, in accordance with truth, is called the "inward" man; and sometimes the
sensitive part with the body is called man in the opinion of those whose observation does
not go beyond the senses. And this is called the "outward" man. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I.75.5: WHETHER THE SOUL IS COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM? </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>N.B. Within this article are two arguments. The first is that since soul is to matter as actuality
is to potency, no soul is composed of matter. The second argument relies upon the
individuating character of matter to prove that the human soul must be totally immaterial.</EM></STRONG><EM></EM></P>

<P><STRONG>I answer that, The soul has no matter. We may consider this question in two ways. <EM>First,</EM>
from the notion of a soul in general; for it belongs to the notion of a soul to be the form of a
body. Now, <EM>either</EM> it is a form by virtue of itself, in its entirety, <EM>or</EM> by virtue of some part of
itself. If by virtue of itself in its entirety, then it is impossible that any part of it should be
matter, if by matter we understand something purely potential: for a form, as such, is an
act; and that which is purely potentiality cannot be part of an act, since potentiality is
repugnant to actuality as being opposite thereto. If, however, it be a form by virtue of a
part of itself, then we call that part the soul: and that matter, which it actualizes first, we
call "[a living] body." </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>Secondly</EM>, we may proceed from the specific notion of the human soul inasmuch as it is
intellectual. For it is clear that whatever is received into something is received according to
the condition of the recipient. Now a thing is known in as far as its form is in the knower.
But the intellectual soul [understands the universal natures of things]: for instance, it
knows a stone according to its nature as a stone [[as it knows wax according to its nature as
wax]]; and therefore the form of a stone universally considered is in the intellectual soul.
...<EM>But if the intellectual soul were composed of matter and form, the forms of things would be
received into it as individuals, and so it would only know the individual</EM>: just as it happens
with the sensitive powers which receive forms in a corporeal organ; since matter is the
principle by which forms are individualized. It follows, therefore, that the intellectual soul,
and every intellectual substance which has knowledge of [universals] is exempt from
composition of matter and form. </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I.75.6: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS INCORRUPTIBLE? </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>N.B. If the soul is incorruptible, then it is immortal because existence cannot be separated
from what is incorruptible. Aquinas' argument that the human soul is incorruptible relies
upon the ideas that nothing is divisible from itself and that the human soul and its subsistence
are one. </EM></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>OBJ 3: Further, nothing is without its own proper operation. But the operation proper to
the soul, which is to understand through a sense image, cannot be without the body. For
the soul understands nothing without a sense image; and there is no sense image without
the body as the Philosopher says (De Anima i, 1). Therefore the soul cannot survive the
dissolution of the body. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I answer that, We must assert that the intellectual principle which we call the human soul is
incorruptible. For a thing may be corrupted in two ways---through itself and through
another. Now it is impossible for any substance to be generated or corrupted through
another. .... for generation and corruption belong to a thing, just as existence belongs to it,
which is acquired by generation and lost by corruption. Therefore, whatever has existence
through itself cannot be generated or corrupted except through itself; while things which do
not subsist, such as properties and material forms, acquire existence or lose it through the
generation or corruption of composite things. Now it was shown above (AA2,3) that the
souls of brutes are not self-subsistent, whereas the human soul is; so that the souls of brutes
are corrupted, when their bodies are corrupted; while the human soul could not be
corrupted unless it were corrupted "per se." This, indeed, is impossible, not only as regards
the human soul, but also as regards anything subsistent that is a form alone. <EM>For</EM> it is clear
that what belongs to a thing by virtue of itself is inseparable from it; but subsistence
belongs to those forms which have an act that is NOT in and through matter by virtue of
itself. Therefore matter acquires actual existence as it acquires the form; while it is
corrupted so far as the form is separated from it. But it is impossible for a form to be
separated from itself; and therefore it is impossible for a subsistent form to cease to exist. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>... Moreover ...a sign [that this argument is right may be taken] from the fact that
everything naturally aspires to existence after its own manner. Now, in things that have
knowledge, desire ensues upon knowledge. The senses indeed do not know existence, except
under the conditions of "here" and "now," whereas the intellect apprehends existence
absolutely, and for all time; so that everything that has an intellect naturally desires always
to exist. <EM>But a natural desire cannot be in vain.</EM> Therefore every intellectual substance is
incorruptible. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 3: To understand through a sense image is the proper operation of the soul by
virtue of its union with the body. After separation from the body it will have another mode
of understanding, similar to other substances separated from bodies, as will appear later on
(Q89, A1). </STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>I.75.7: WHETHER THE HUMAN SOUL IS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS AN ANGEL? </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>N.B. If the human soul is subsistent, then it seems that it is angelic. So the question arises
whether human beings are really angels. This article's argument relies upon the individuating
character of quantified matter in order to explain why there are many individuals within the
human species while there is only one individual within each species of angels. </EM></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>OBJ 3: Further, it seems that the soul does not differ from an angel except in its union with
the body. But as the body is outside the essence of the soul, it seems that it does not belong
to its species. Therefore the soul and angel are of the same species. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>ON THE CONTRARY</EM>, Things which have different natural operations are of different
species. <EM>[ACTIVITIES REVEAL NATURE</EM>.] But the natural operations of the soul and of an
angel are different; since, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii), "Angelic minds have simple
and blessed intelligence, not gathering their knowledge of Divine things from visible
things." Subsequently he says the contrary to this of the soul. Therefore the soul and an
angel are not of the same species. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>I answer that, angels and human souls cannot belong to the same species; for in incorporeal
substances there cannot be diversity of number without diversity of species and inequality
of nature; because, as they are not composed of matter and form, but are subsistent forms,
it is clear that there is necessarily among them a diversity of species. For a separate form
cannot be understood otherwise than as one of a single species; thus, supposing a separate
whiteness to exist, it could only be one; forasmuch as one whiteness does not differ from
another except as in this or that subject. . . .For if the matter of one be distinct from the
matter of another, it follows that either the form is the principle of the distinction of
matter--that is to say, that the matter is distinct on account of its relation to divers forms;
and even then there would result a difference of species and inequality of nature; or else the
matter is the principle of the distinction of forms. But one matter cannot be distinct from
another, except by a distinction of quantity, which has no place in these incorporeal
substances, such as an angel and the soul. So that it is not possible for the angel and the
soul to be of the same species. . . . [In other words,<EM> human beings differ in their bodies but
not in their species; while angels, since they lack bodies, cannot differ except by being
different species.] </EM></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Reply OBJ 3: The body is not of the essence of the soul; but the soul by the nature of its
essence can be united to the body, so that, properly speaking, not the soul alone, but the
"composite," is the species. And the very fact that the soul in a certain way requires the
body for its operation, proves that the soul is endowed with a grade of intellectuality
inferior to that of an angel, who is not united to a body. </STRONG></P>
