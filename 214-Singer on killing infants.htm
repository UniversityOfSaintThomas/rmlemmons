<p><b>JUSTIFYING INFANTICIDE AND NON-VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA</b></p>
<p>As we have seen, euthanasia is non-voluntary when the subject has never had 
the capacity to choose to live or die. This is the situation of the severely 
disabled infant or the older human being who has been profoundly intellectually 
disabled since birth. Euthanasia or other forms of killing are also non- 
voluntary when the subject is not now but once was capable of making the crucial 
choice, and did not then express any preference relevant to her present 
condition.</p>
<p>The case of someone who has never been capable of choosing to live or die is 
a little more straightforward than that of a person who had, but has now lost, 
the capacity to make such a decision. We shall, once again, separate the two 
cases and take the more straightforward one first. For simplicity, I shall 
concentrate on infants, although everything I say about them would apply to 
older children or adults whose mental age is and has always been that of an 
infant.</p>
<p><b>Life and Death Decisions for Disabled Infants</b></p>
<p>If we were to approach the issue of life or death for a seriously disabled 
human infant without any prior discussion of the ethics of killing in general, 
we might be unable to resolve the conflict between the widely accepted 
obligation to protect the sanctity of human life, and the goal of reducing 
suffering. Some say that such decisions are 'subjective', or that life and death 
questions must be left to God and Nature. Our previous discussions have, 
however, prepared the ground, and the principles established and applied in the 
preceding three chapters make the issue much less baffling than most take it to 
be.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4 we saw that the fact that a being is a human being, in the sense 
of a member of the species Homo sapiens, is not relevant to the wrongness of 
killing it; it is, rather, characteristics like rationality, autonomy, and 
self-consciousness that make a difference. Infants lack these characteristics. 
Killing them, therefore, cannot be equated with killing normal human beings, or 
any other self-conscious beings. This conclusion is not limited to infants who, 
because of irreversible intellectual disabilities, will never be rational, 
self-conscious beings. We saw in our discussion of abortion that the potential 
of a fetus to become a rational, self-conscious being cannot count against 
killing it at a stage when it lacks these characteristics - not, that is, unless 
we are also prepared to count the value of rational self-conscious life as a 
reason against contraception and celibacy. No infant - disabled or not - has as 
strong a claim to life as beings capable of seeing themselves as distinct 
entities, existing over time.</p>
<p>The difference between killing disabled and normal infants lies not in any 
supposed right to life that the latter has and the former lacks, but in other 
considerations about killing. Most obviously there is the difference that often 
exists in the attitudes of the parents. The birth of a child is usually a happy 
event for the parents. They have, nowadays, often planned for the child. The 
mother has carried it for nine months. From birth, a natural affection begins to 
bind the parents to it. So one important reason why it is normally a terrible 
thing to kill an infant is the effect the killing will have on its parents.</p>
<p>It is different when the infant is born with a serious disability. Birth 
abnormalities vary, of course. Some are trivial and have little effect on the 
child or its parents; but others turn the normally joyful event of birth into a 
threat to the happiness of the parents, and any other children they may have.</p>
<p>Parents may, with good reason, regret that a disabled child was ever born. In 
that event the effect that the death of the child will have on its parents can 
be a reason for, rather than against killing it. Some parents want even the most 
gravely disabled infant to live as long as possible, and this desire would then 
be a reason against killing the infant. But what if this is not the case? in the 
discussion that follows I shall assume that the parents do not want the disabled 
child to live. I shall also assume that the disability is so serious that - 
again in contrast to the situation of an unwanted but normal child today - there 
are no other couples keen to adopt the infant. This is a realistic assumption 
even in a society in which there is a long waiting- list of couples wishing to 
adopt normal babies. It is true that from time to time cases of infants who are 
severely disabled and are being allowed to die have reached the courts in a 
glare of publicity, and this has led to couples offering to adopt the child. 
Unfortunately such offers are the product of the highly publicised dramatic 
life-and-death situation, and do not extend to the less publicised but far more 
cormnon situations in which parents feel themselves unable to look after a 
severely disabled child, and the child then languishes in an institution.</p>
<p>Infants are sentient beings who are neither rational nor self- conscious. So 
if we turn to consider the infants in themselves, independently of the attitudes 
of their parents, since their species is not relevant to their moral status, the 
principles that govern the wrongness of killing non-human animals who are 
sentient but not rational or self-conscious must apply here too. As we saw, the 
most plausible arguments for attributing a right to life to a being apply only 
if there is some awareness of oneself as a being existing over time, or as a 
continuing mental self. Nor can respect for autonomy apply where there is no 
capacity for autonomy. The remaining principles identified in Chapter 4 are 
utilitarian. Hence the quality of life that the infant can be expected to have 
is important.</p>
<p>One relatively common birth disability is a faulty development of the spine 
known as spina bifida. Its prevalence, varies in different countries, but it can 
affect as many as one in five hundred live births. In the more severe cases, the 
child will be permanently paralysed from the waistdown and lack control of 
bowels or bladder. Often excess fluid accumulates in the brain, a condition 
known as hydrocephalus, which can result in intellectual disabilities. Though 
some forms of treatment exist, if the child is badly affected at birth, the 
paralysis, incontinence, and intellectual disability cannot be overcome.</p>
<p>Some doctors closely connected with children suffering from severe spina 
bifida believe that the lives of the worst affected children are so miserable 
that it is wrong to resort to surgery to keep them alive. Published descriptions 
of the lives of these children support the judgment that these worst affected 
children will have lives filled with pain and discomfort. They need repeated 
major surgery to prevent curvature of the spine, due to the paralysis, and to 
correct other abnormalities. Some children with spina bifida have had forty 
major operations before they reach their teenage years.</p>
<p>When the life of an infant will be so miserable as not to be worth living, 
from the internal perspective of the being who will lead that life, both the 
'prior existence' and the 'total' version of utilitarianism entail that, if 
there are no 'extrinsic' reasons for keeping the infant alive - like the 
feelings of the parents - it is better that the child should be helped to die 
without further suffering. A more difficult problem arises - and the convergence 
between the two views ends - when we consider disabilities that make the child's 
life prospects significantly less promising than those of a normal child, but 
not so bleak as to make the child's life not worth living. Haemophilia is 
probably in this category. The haemophiliac lacks the element in normal blood 
that makes it clot and thus risks prolonged bleeding, especially internal 
bleeding, from the slightest injury. if allowed to continue, this bleeding leads 
to permanent crippling and eventually death. The bleeding is very painful and 
although improved treatments have eliminated the need for constant blood 
transfusions, haemophiliacs still have to spend a lot of time in hospital. They 
are unable to play most sports and live constantly on the edge of crisis. 
Nevertheless, haemophiliacs do not appear to spend their time wondering whether 
to end it all; most find life definitely worth living, despite the difficulties 
they face.</p>
<p>Given these facts, suppose that a newborn baby is diagnosed as a haemophiliac. 
The parents, daunted by the prospect of bringing up a child with this condition, 
are not anxious for him to live. Could euthanasia be defended here? Our first 
reaction may well be a firm 'no', for the infant can be expected to have a life 
that is worth living, even if not quite as good as that of a normal baby. The 
'prior existence' version of utilitarianism sup- ports this judgment. The infant 
exists. His life can be expected to contain a positive balance of happiness over 
misery. To kill him would deprive him of this positive balance of happiness. 
Therefore it would be wrong.</p>
<p>On the 'total' version of utilitarianism, however, we cannot reach a decision 
on the basis of this information alone. The total view makes it necessary to ask 
whether the death of the haemophiliac infant would lead to the creation of 
another being who would not otherwise have existed. In other words, if the 
haemophiliac child is killed, will his parents have another child whom they 
would not have if the haemophiliac child lives? If they would, is the second 
child likely to have a better life than the one killed?</p>
<p>Often it will be possible to answer both these questions affinnatively. A 
woman may plan to have two children. If one dies while she is of child-bearing 
age, she may conceive another in its place. Suppose a woman planning to have two 
children has one normal child, and then gives birth to a haemophiliac child. The 
burden of caring for that child may make it impossible for her to cope with a 
third child; but if the disabled child were to die, she would have another. It 
is also plausible to suppose that the prospects of a happy life are better for a 
normal child than for a haemophiliac.</p>
<p>When the death of a disabled infant will lead to the birth of another infant 
with better prospects of a happy life, the total amount of happiness will be 
greater if the disabled infant is killed. The loss of happy life for the first 
infant is outweighed by the gain of a happier life for the second. Therefore, if 
killing the haemophiliac infant has no adverse effect on others, it would, 
according to the total view, be right to kill him.</p>
<p>The total view treats infants as replaceable, in much the same way as it 
treats non-self-conscious animals (as we saw in Chapter 5). Many will think that 
the replaceability argument cannot be applied to human infants. The direct 
killing of even the most hopelessly disabled infant is still officially regarded 
as murder; how then could the killing of infants with far less serious problems, 
like haernophilia, be accepted? Yet on further reflection, the implications of 
the replaceability argument do not seem quite so bizarre. For there are disabled 
members of our species whom we now deal with exactly as the argument suggests we 
should. These cases closely resemble the ones we have been discussing. There is 
only one difference, and that is a difference of timing - the timing of the 
discovery of the problem, and the consequent killing of the disabled being.</p>
<p>Prenatal diagnosis is now a routine procedure for pregnant women. There are 
various medical techniques for obtaining information about the fetus during the 
early months of pregnancy. At one stage in the development of these procedures, 
it was possible to discover the sex of the fetus, but not whether the fetus 
would suffer from haemophilia. Haemophilia is a sex- linked genetic defect, from 
which only males suffer; females can carry the gene and pass it on to their male 
offspring without themselves being affected. So a woman who knew that she 
carried the gene for haemophilia could, at that stage, avoid giving birth to a 
haemophiliac child only by finding out the sex of the fetus, and aborting all 
males fetuses. Statistically, only half of these male children of women who 
carried the defective gene would have suffered from haernophilia, but there was 
then no way to find out to which half a particular fetus belonged. Therefore 
twice as many fetuses were being killed as necessary, in order to avoid the 
birth of children with haemophilia. This practice was widespread in many 
countries, and yet did not cause any great outcry. Now that we have techniques 
for identifying haemophilia before birth, we can be more selective, but the 
principle is the same: women are offered, and usually accept, abortions in order 
to avoid giving birth to children with haemophilia.</p>
<p>The same can be said about some other conditions that can be detected before 
birth. Down's syndrome, formerly known as mongolism, is one of these. Children 
with this condition have intellectual disabilities and most will never be able 
to live in- dependently, but their lives, like those of small children, can be 
joyful. The risk of having a Down's syndrome child increases sharply with the 
age of the mother, and for this reason prenatal diagnosis is routinely offered 
to pregnant women over 35. Again, undergoing the procedure implies that if the 
test for Down's syndrome is positive, the woman will consider aborting the fetus 
and, if she still wishes to have another child, will start another pregnancy, 
which has a good chance of being normal.</p>
<p>Prenatal diagnosis, followed by abortion in selected cases, is common 
practice in countries with liberal abortion laws and advanced medical 
techniques. I think this is as it should be. As the arguments of Chapter 6 
indicate, I believe that abortion can be justified. Note, however, that neither 
haemophilia nor Down's syndrome is so crippling as to make life not worth 
living, from the inner perspective of the person with the condition. To abort a 
fetus with one of these disabilities, intending to have another child who will 
not be disabled, is to treat fetuses as interchangeable or replaceable. If the 
mother has previously decided to have a certain number of children, say two, 
then what she is doing, in effect, is rejecting one potential child in favour of 
another. She could, in defence of her actions, say: the loss of life of the 
aborted fetus is outweighed by the gain of a better life for the normal child 
who will be conceived only if the disabled one dies.</p>
<p>When death occurs before birth, replaceability does not conflict with 
generally accepted moral convictions. That a fetus is known to be disabled is 
widely accepted as a ground for abortion. Yet in discussing abortion, we saw 
that birth does not mark a morally significant dividing line. I cannot see how 
one could defend the view that fetuses may be 'replaced' before birth, but 
newborn infants may not be. Nor is there any other point, such as viability, 
that does a better job of dividing the fetus from the infant. 
Self-consciousness, which could provide a basis for holding that it is wrong to 
kill one being and replace it with another, is not to be found in either the 
fetus or the newborn infant. Neither the fetus nor the newborn infant is an 
individual capable of regarding itself as a distinct entity with a life of its 
own to lead, and it is only for newborn infants, or for still earlier stages of 
human life, that replaceability should be considered to be an ethically 
acceptable option.</p>
<p>It may still be objected that to replace either a fetus or a newborn infant 
is wrong because it suggests to disabled people living today that their lives 
are less worth living than the lives of people who are not disabled. Yet it is 
surely flying in the face of reality to deny that, on average, this is so. That 
is the only way to make sense of actions that we all take for granted. Recall 
thalidomide: this drug, when taken by pregnant women, caused many children to be 
born without arms or legs. Once the cause of the abnormal births was discovered, 
the drug was taken off the market, and the company responsible had to pay 
compensation. If we really believed that there is no reason to think of the life 
of a disabled person as likely to be any worse than that of a normal person, we 
would not have regarded this as a tragedy. No compensation would have been 
sought, or awarded by the courts. The children would merely have been 
'different'. We could even have left the drug on the market, so that women who 
found it a useful sleeping pill during pregnancy could continue to take it. If 
this sounds grotesque, that is only because we are all in no doubt at all that 
it is better to be born with limbs than without them. To believe this involves 
no disrespect at all for those who are lacking limbs; it simply recognises the 
reality of the difficulties they face.</p>
<p>In any case, the position taken here does not imply that it would be better 
that no people born with severe disabilities should survive; it implies only 
that the parents of such infants should be able to make this decision. Nor does 
this imply lack of respect or equal consideration for people with disabilities 
who are now living their own lives in accordance with their own wishes. As we 
saw at the end of Chapter 2, the principle of equal consideration of interests 
rejects any discounting of the interests of people on grounds of disability.</p>
<p>Even those who reject abortion and the idea that the fetus is replaceable are 
likely to regard possible people as replaceable. Recall the second woman in 
Parfit's case of the two women, described in Chapter 5. She was told by her 
doctor that if she went ahead with her plan to become pregnant immediately, her 
child would have a disability (it could have been haemophilia); but if she 
waited three months her child would not have the disability. If we think she 
would do wrong not to wait, it can only be because we are comparing the two 
possible lives and judging one to have better prospects than the other. Of 
course, at this stage no life has begun; but the question is, when does a life, 
in the morally significant sense, really begin? in Chapters 4 and 5 we saw 
several reasons for saying that life only begins in the morally significant 
sense when there is awareness of one's existence over time. The metaphor of life 
as a journey also provides a reason for holding that in infancy, life's voyage 
has scarcely begun.</p>
<p>Regarding newborn infants as replaceable, as we now regard fetuses, would 
have considerable advantages over prenatal diagnosis followed by abortion. 
Prenatal diagnosis still cannot detect all major disabilities. Some 
disabilities, in fact, are not present before birth; they may be the result of 
extremely pre- mature birth, or of something going wrong in the birth process 
itself. At present parents can choose to keep or destroy their disabled 
offspring only if the disability happens to be detected during pregnancy. There 
is no logical basis for restricting parents' choice to these particular 
disabilities. If disabled newborn infants were not regarded as having a right to 
life until, say, a week or a month after birth it would allow parents, in 
consultation with their doctors, to choose on the basis of far greater knowledge 
of the infant's condition than is possible before birth.<br>
All these remarks have been concerned with the wrongness of ending the life of 
the infant, considered in itself rather than for its effects on others. When we 
take effects on others into account, the picture may alter. Obviously, to go 
through the whole of pregnancy and labour, only to give birth to a child who one 
decides should not live, would be a difficult, perhaps heartbreaking, 
experience. For this reason many women would prefer prenatal diagnosis and 
abortion rather than live birth with the possibility of infanticide; but if the 
latter is not morally worse than the former, this would seem to be a choice that 
the woman herself should be allowed to make.</p>
<p>Another factor to take into account is the possibility of adoption. When 
there are more couples wishing to adopt than nor- mal children available for 
adoption, a childless couple may be prepared to adopt a haemophiliac. This would 
relieve the mother of the burden of bringing up a haemophiliac child, and enable 
her to have another child, if she wished. Then the replaceability argument could 
not justify infanticide, for bringing the other child into existence would not 
be dependent on the death of the haemophiliac. The death of the haemophiliac 
would then be a straightforward loss of a life of positive quality, not 
outweighed by the creation of another being with a better life.</p>
<p>So the issue of ending life for disabled newborn infants is not without 
complications, which we do not have the space to discuss adequately. 
Nevertheless the main point is clear: killing a disabled infant is not morally 
equivalent to killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all.</p>
