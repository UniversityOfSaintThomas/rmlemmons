Peacemakers: A Documentary History. </i></b>New York: Garland Pub, 1993-1996. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Abstract:</b> This two volume set 
reprints documents from scripture, patristic and medieval authors, and modern Catholic writers 
and Church leaders on the subject of peace. Volume One ends with the early Middle Ages; 
Volume Two (published in two books) completes the collection. The Documentary 
History serves as a companion to the earlier <i>The Catholic Peace Tradition</i> (Orbis, 
1986), and <i>The Peace Tradition in the Catholic Church (Garland, 1987). </i> </p>

One: The Social Teaching of the Papal Encyclicals, </i></b>1740-1989. Washington, D.C.: Georgetown 
University Press, 1991. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Abstract: </b>While typical 
analysis of papal teaching is limited to a few designated &quot;social letters,&quot; Schuck’s study takes a 
wider focus. This work examines letters predating Leo XIII, and takes into account all 284 
letters written by the seventeen popes since 1740. The expanded reading aims to provide 
context for particular language in a single text, along with a broader framework for 
understanding specific commentary on social ethics and public affairs. </p>

Leo's Small Catechism of Social Justice.&quot; </b><i>Lutheran Theological Journal</i> 25 (1991): 
101-8. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Abstract: The author briefly 
discusses the history of Rerum Novarum and the developments in the Catholic 
Church since its issuance. However, the primary focus of Overduin’s article is 
on the application of Rerum Novarum to the Lutheran church in Australia and the 
development of Lutheran social teachings. He concludes by comparing Pope Leo 
XIII’s document with the writings of Luther. </p>
