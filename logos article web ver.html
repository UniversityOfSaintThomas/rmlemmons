<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R. Mary Hayden Lemmons
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IT IS WIDELY ARGUED that neither
John Paul II nor the Catholic Church could possibly be committed to gender
equality, since women cannot be ordained.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This argument presupposes that
equality precludes gender differentiation. If so, then differentiated gender
roles reflect inequality. But is this right? Must all
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forms of equality obliterate all
differences? Or, is it possible for there to be an equality of difference?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the one hand, it does not seem
possible for the different to be equal, because the different—as such—lack
some commonality whereby they can be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compared and known as equal, or
even as inferior/superior. Accordingly, "an equality of difference" would
be oxymoronic, if it did not presuppose some
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type of commonality whereby comparisons
could be made. So the question becomes whether the commonality that allows
comparison must be identical;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must "equality" be a univocal
concept? For example, the equality of car drivers is univocal, or the same:
the role of driving is the same for each, each must
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obey traffic rules and each is
penalized in the same way for traffic violations. Contrast the univocal
nature of driving a car with the analogical nature of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being an artist: not all artists
[End Page 111] function in the same way, for example, some make music,
others paintings. Yet Beethoven and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelangelo are equally great
artists. In this sense, the equality of Beethoven and Michelangelo, while
based upon the commonality of excellence, is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based upon the same excellence
but upon an analogous excellence arising from the relationship of the artist
to art: Beethoven is related to music as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelangelo is related to painting;
since those relationships pertain to excellence, they are equals; but since
their excellences are different, their equality
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is analogical. Could it thus be
that such an "equality of difference" underlies John Paul II's rejection
of ordaining women? If so, then three conditions would
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have to be met: (1) John Paul
II would have to be unequivocally supportive of equality between men and
women, while (2) upholding gender roles that would
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allow equality to be based upon
a commonality that is analogous rather than univocal; and, (3) he would
also have to hold that ordained priesthood is a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gender role.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That John Paul II meets these three
conditions can be seen in his Apostolic Letter, On the Dignity and Vocation
of Women (Mulieris Dignitatem). 1 In this
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letter, John Paul II expresses
a commitment to gender equality based upon a sacramental theology wherein
nature images the divine and wherein the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equality of man and woman was
definitively established by Genesis 1:27: "God created man in His own image,
in the image of God He created him; male
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and female He created them."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
this point, however, we can say that the biblical account puts forth the
truth about the personal character of the human being. Man is a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
person, man and woman equally so, since both were created in the image
and likeness of the personal God. (Mulieris Dignitatem n. 6)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man and woman equally image God.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, why are these equal images
sexually differentiated? Could it be that male and female—as a pair—also
image God? John Paul II thinks so: [End Page
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 112]
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
. . . we wish to draw also from the narrative of the Yahwist text the concept
of "image of God," we can then deduce that man became the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"image and likeness" of God not only through his own humanity, but also
through the communion of persons which man and woman form
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
right from the beginning. The function of the image is to reflect the one
who is the model, to reproduce its own prototype. Man becomes the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
image of God not so much in the moment of solitude as in the moment of
communion. . . . [H]e is . . . essentially an image of an inscrutable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
divine communion of persons. 2
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, heterosexual love
and spousal oneness image nothing less than the love and oneness of the
Trinity, wherein the distinction of persons—and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; roles—precludes neither unity
nor equality. Since the Trinity constitutes the inner life of God, whatever
best images the Trinity becomes the definitive and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paradigmatic image of God. The
spousal unification in love excels in imaging the triune God in the following
ways: (1) by being a unit constituted by love;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) by being a fecund unit that
is not closed in upon itself but is turned outward in the bringing forth
of new life; and (3) by being a unit of distinct equals. In
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this way, the loving heterosexual
marriage, as the best icon of the Trinity, becomes not only the definitive
and paradigmatic image of God but also of life
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and love; we live to love. 3 It
is for the sake of fruitful love that God sexually differentiated the human
race. 4 Hence, the human mission to love in the image
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Trinity bestows upon femininity
and masculinity their proper meanings: the meaning of femininity is to
facilitate woman's ability to enter into
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relationships of fruitful love
and unity between equals; the meaning of masculinity is likewise to facilitate
man's ability to enter into relationships of fruitful
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love and unity between equals.
Sexuality is for facilitating a Trinitarian-like love.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been argued—on the basis
of Scripture—that marriage institutionalizes sexual inequality. In this
regard, two passages are cited most
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frequently:Genesis 2:18-25, in
which God declares that [End Page 113] Adam will receive a helper fit for
him; and Ephesians 5:22-23, in which wives are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; told to be submissive to their
husbands. Being a helper and being submissive can be understood either
as a gender role peculiar to wives or as a spousal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; role common to both men and women.
The first interpretation—by denying spousal reciprocity and mutuality—establishes
an inequality that contradicts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Genesis 1:27 which, according
to Mulieris Dignitatem n. 6, reveals that "both man and woman are human
beings to an equal degree, both are created in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's image." John Paul II also
argues that the Genesis text describing woman as brought forth from Adam's
rib confirms her equality. 5 Taking these
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; texts as his guide, John Paul
II argues that the scriptural texts identifying the wife as helper and
as submissive are identifying spousal roles: man is also
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wife's helper 6 and is also
submissive to her in Christ. 7 The latter account is particularly explicit:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
author of the Letter to the Ephesians sees no contradiction between an
exhortation formulated in this way and the words: "Wives, be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
subject to your husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of
the wife" (5:22-23) The author knows that this way of speaking, so
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
profoundly rooted in the customs and religious tradition of the time, is
to be understood and carried out in a new way: as a "mutual
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
subjection out of reverence for Christ" (cf. Eph. 5:21). . . . [I]n the
relationship between husband and wife the "subjection" is not one-sided
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
but mutual.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
relation to the "old" this is evidently something "new": it is an innovation
of the Gospel. (Mulieris Dignitatem n. 24)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All
of the reasons in favor of the "subjection" of woman to man in marriage
must be understood in the sense of a "mutual subjection" of both
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"out of reverence for Christ." Mulieris Dignitatem n. 24. [End Page 114]
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Paul II's treatment of these
scriptural passages reveals a deep commitment to the equality of men and
women.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Paul II's treatment also reveals
a sensitivity to the radical nature of the Gospel message: Christ sought
to restore woman to the equality, respect,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and dignity that was hers in the
beginning, that is, before Original Sin. Original Sin not only ruptured
the relationship of human beings to God but also the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relationship between men and women.
Genesis 3:16 is quite explicit that some penalties of Original Sin are
gender-specific, affecting even the spousal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; union of love: "Your desire shall
be for your husband, and he shall rule over you." In other words, Original
Sin left woman with the desire to close her love in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon her husband and make him
the lord, while Original Sin left men with the desire to dominate women.
Yielding to either desire is the wellspring of all
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gender sins—even in today's world.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither the gender ramifications
of Original Sin nor their gravity have been fully recognized. Spouses have
suffered much from their effects. Moreover, John
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul II teaches, in Mulieris Dignitatem
n.10, that the Genesis punishments "refer directly to marriage, but indirectly
they concern the different spheres of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; social life: the situations in
which the woman remains disadvantaged or discriminated against by the fact
of being a woman." Original Sin is thus
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; responsible for the cultural prevalence
of chauvinistic male domination. Male domination has been responsible for
much suffering on the part of woman
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; valued as existing only for the
sake of man—and not for her own sake. This is particularly the case since
lust gives male domination its particular color. A
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man's lust confirms his dominating
tendency and prevents the woman from being seen as man's equal; she is,
for the man, an object of sexual
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gratification. As a result, lust
and its presuppositions of inequality are especially destructive of spousal
love, which requires each spouse to be a gift of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love for the other.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lust and inequality block the ability
of the husband to recognize the wife's acts of love as gifts; rather, such
husbands treat any act of love as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acknowledgment of his superiority.
In such relationships, [End Page 115] there is nothing the woman can do
that can be recognized as a spousal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love-gift; her initiatives are
misunderstood as attempts to gain power over the man; they are not perceived
as invitingan equal to a union of love. As a writer
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to Ann Landers complained: 8
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
truth is, there is not a woman on the planet who can fully satisfy the
needs of a powerful male. When women quit asking men to make
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
them the center of their universe and learn to accept a strong man's desire
for more than one female companion, families will live together
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
longer, more happily and with less rancor.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prejudice is blinding. For this
reason, male chauvinism is not merely selfishness but a destroyer of the
possibility of interpersonal love between equals. As
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Pope points out:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "domination"
indicates the disturbance and loss of the stability of that fundamental
equality which the man and the woman possess in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"unity of the two": and this is especially to the disadvantage of the woman,
whereas only the equalityresulting from their dignity as persons
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
can give to their mutual relationship the character of an authentic "communio
personarum."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Mulieris Dignitatem n. 10 )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equality, thus, for John Paul II,
is a necessary prerequisite to marital love. Unless a man first affirms
that a woman is his equal, her love can neither be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recognized as a gift nor reciprocated;
without reciprocation, an "authentic" spousal communion cannot be established.
In other words, the man's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affirmation of a woman's equality
necessarily precedes her ability to be a gift of love to the man as well
as the man's ability to be a gift of love to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; woman. Thus, John PaulII—in order
to protect the conditions necessary for spousal love—denounces inequality
and domination—and encourages all to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resist the effects of Original
Sin. 9 This resistance requires recognizing that interpersonal relations
belong to the category of love that [End Page 116]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeks to serve and not to the
category of power that seeks to dominate. That this is so was revealed
by Christ: "Christ . . . fully reveals man to himself
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and brings to light his most high
calling" (Gaudium et Spes n. 22). John Paul II frequently cites this text
and acknowledges that it "serves as a constant
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reference point" of his teaching.
10
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gender-specific weaknesses
resulting from Original Sin identify not only the characteristic ways in
which men and women sin against each other but
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also the ways in which healing
must occur. Overcoming the Genesis penalties requires healing not only
the rift between earth and heaven but also the rift
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between man and woman. Jesus Christ
is the healer of both rifts. So the question before us is why is the Divine
Healer male? Could Christ have been a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; woman? Could a female Christ have
healed the relationship between human beings and God while also healing
the relationship between men and women?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we consider the humanitarian
role of Christ whereby He healed the relationship between human beings
and God, it seems that Christ did not need to be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; male: both man and woman are equally
human beings, they equally image God. This is especially the case, since
God lacks gender 11 and since God
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exhibits both masculine and feminine
characteristics. 12 Accordingly, since the Humanitarian Mission of Christ
required only that the Redeemer be fully
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human and fully God, a female
incarnation of Christ would have been as able as the male incarnation to
reunite humanity to God. 13
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could a female Christ have also
healed the breach between men and women? Could she have healed the rift
in the female heart between being
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man-centered and being God-centered?
Could she have healed the rift in the male heart between the thirst for
domination and for being a gift of love? Could
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a female Christ have fulfilled
the divine Gender Mission of healing the relationship between men and women?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A female Christ could not have
healed the male heart and given men the realization that they ought to
be lovers rather than dominators [End Page 117] :
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precisely because the truth about
a female Christ would have been as obscure to fallen men as the truth about
women. For Original Sin left men blinded
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the attractiveness of lust
and domination. That this blindness makes it difficult to properly appreciate
the truth about woman can be seen in the ways in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which cultures institutionalize
male chauvinism and deny woman her natural equality with men. History is
filled with examples of such deprivations
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ranging, for example, from exclusive
male suffrage to polygyny, the selling of daughters as prostitutes, ancient
Chinese footbinding, wife-burning in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precolonial India, and the selective
use of abortion against female babies. The absence of such gross forms
of injustice within any particular culture does
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not exonerate that culture, since
the effects of Original Sin continue as male chauvinism. Ending male oppression
requires Christ to reveal to men, and to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women, that the mission of masculinity
lies not in egotistical domination but in the continual laying down of
one's life for the sake of love. 14 "Christ . . .
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fully reveals man to himself and
brings to light his most high calling." 15 This basic aspect of Christ's
Gender Mission could not have been accomplished if
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ had been incarnated as
a woman—especially since male chauvinism identifies subordination as the
proper feminine response to manliness. Thus,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no woman could have revealed that
masculinity means—not superiority—but a love so strong that it counts any
cross naught.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women also need Christ to be male;
because, since a woman can only be a gift of love when her dignity and
equality are respected, woman cannot relate
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to man as God intended, unless
man first acknowledges her dignity and equality. This Christ was careful
to do:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meditating
on what the Gospels say about Christ's attitude towards women, we can conclude
that as a man, a son of Israel, he revealed the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dignity of the "daughters of Abraham" (cf. Luke 13:16), the dignity belonging
to women from the very "beginning" on an equal footing with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
men." (Mulieris Dignitatem n. 25) [End Page 118]
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ's affirmation of the equality
and dignity of woman through "the Gospel of His words and deeds," writes
John Paul II (Mulieris Dignitatem n. 15), "is a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consistent protest against whatever
offends the dignity of women." Hence, the surprise and the dismay of others
recorded in John 4:27 and Luke 7:39;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hence also, the revolutionary
character of his teaching against stoning women adulterers, divorce, and
lust recorded in John 8:3-11, Matthew 19:3-8, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew 5:28, respectively.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps even more radical is the
message delivered by His rebuke of Martha in Luke 10:38-42: "Martha, Martha,
you are anxious and worried about many
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things. There is need of only
one thing." What was the only thing that the eminently practical Martha
had overlooked? The need to do what Mary was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doing, namely, sitting "at the
feet of the Master." 16 To so sit means to be dedicated to learning. This
is a radical teaching, a countercultural
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teaching—delivered to a woman,
for the sake of all women: women have minds and souls that not only must
learn the meaning of life, but that also enable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them to live the life of learning:
"Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her" (Luke
10:42). Christ thereby disagreed with Martha's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; view of womanly duties: femininity
calls one to be practical, asserted Martha; femininity calls one to learn,
responded Christ. "The one thing that is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; needful" is learning about God;
it is femininity's higher function. Femininity is not reducible to the
realm of practicality—and husbands. The husband is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the adequate object of all feminine
yearning: this yearning includes a thirst for God and for learning about
His handiwork. Hence the error of male
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chauvinists and of the world's
"Marthas" who consider the feminine mind as qualified only for practical
concerns and not for the highest forms of wisdom.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This error was thoroughly trounced,
according to John Paul II, when Christ discussed the "most profound mysteries
of God" with the "Samaritan woman at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the well of Sychar." 17
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The feminine mind, moreover, is
not only able to excel in understanding but it can do so without sacrificing
practicality. Christ, as if [End Page 119] to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stress this point, asked Martha—the
woman identified with practical concerns and worries—whether she believed
the greatest mystery of our faith,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; namely, that Christ is "the resurrection
and the life." This question was very abstract and hence, many would assume,
would be not only beyond the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cognitive abilities of any woman
but especially beyond those of a practical woman. But Martha grasps the
question and her response is neither a gushy,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emotional affirmation nor a deferral
to the judgments of men. Rather her response shows keen insight into the
true identity of Christ: "I have come to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; believe that you are the Messiah,
the Son of God, The One who is coming into the world" (John 11:27). By
this response, Martha not only shows that she
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has acquired that "one needful
thing," but that she has done so with excellence. For she has acquired
the deepest understanding of the identity of Christ:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ is the resurrection and
the life—not because He is merely a great prophet with special God-given
powers—but because He is God, the Messiah.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, femininity, even in its
most practical embodiment, is revealed as being able to intellectually
excel. Femininity is also revealed in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gospels—according to John Paul
II 18 —as giving an edge over men in understanding and responding to the
Gospel messages.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ thus revealed that the meaning
of femininity is not defined by the ability to please men. Woman is the
equal of man—not his tool. Her ability to give
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love—as a woman—is for her own
sake, 19 so that she may discover that femininity is not enslaving but
enriching. True love does not diminish equality.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaudium et Spes n. 22 can therefore
be read in a way that makes its application to woman explicit: Christ fully
reveals woman to herself and brings to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light her most high calling. This
revelation of Christ to woman penetrates her heart and heals the wounding
of Original Sin that left her "desiring/obsessing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over her husband/man." This desire
is sinful, as sinful as male oppression, because it makes the "husband"
the supreme focal point of woman's love. In
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other words, Original Sin so wounded
femininity that woman's love for her man becomes paramount, [End Page 120]
so that no sacrifice is too great.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even maternity, for example, is
often sacrificed upon the altars of woman's love.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This wounding of femininity by
Original Sin can be "handled" either by refusing to enter into marriage
or by integrating the love of one's man with the love of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God. The first option would have
been seen as reasonable, if Christ had been incarnated as a woman—for three
reasons. First, a female Christ would not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been able to give masculinity
a face responsive to woman's dignity and equality. Only a male incarnation
of Christ could enable woman to experience
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that man need not be her subjugator.
Second, a crucified female Christ would have been seen—not as rebuking—but
as confirming the common prejudice
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that sacrificial love is a uniquely
feminine gender role, while the male's gender role is to reign supreme.
Third, a female Christ would not have been able to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heal the ache, left in the feminine
heart by Original Sin, to be fulfilled through love. Jesus Christ, as the
perfect embodiment of masculinity, enables
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; woman to place her love for fallen
man into its proper context: there is only one truly divine man. God, and
not fallen man, is to be loved with the entirety
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of one's mind, heart, and soul.
Therefore, a female Christ could not have healed woman's heart from the
wounding of Original Sin; Christ needed to be a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man in order to accomplish the
divine Gender Mission.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A female Christ would thus have
convinced neither woman nor man that love is liberating and enriching rather
than enslaving. For the gender weaknesses
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Original Sin disposed the sexes
to misconceive gender roles as being constituted by power games and/or
by subservience. It is only Jesus Christ, who
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is able to heal—by His life and
by His grace—the rift between men and women that obscured the ability of
both men and women to see the true dignity
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and equality of each other and,
thereby, to enter into paired relationships of love that image the Trinity.
Love is best between equals, teaches the Trinity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, Jesus Christ—by restoring
the equality of woman with man and by liberating woman from her own enslaving
[End Page 121] desires—enables the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sexes to be equal love-gifts for
each other. Jesus Christ thus made it possible for men and women to lay
down their lives in love—without compromising
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their equality, sexuality, or
dignity. As a result, sexual gender roles can now be empowering by bringing
their participants into the greatest mysteries of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joyful love. As John Paul II explains:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
Christ the mutual opposition between man and woman—which is the inheritance
of original sin—is essentially overcome. "For you are all
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
one in Jesus Christ," St. Paul will write (Gal. 3:28).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These
words concern that original "unity of the two" which is linked with the
creation of the human being as male and female, made in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
image and likeness of God, and based on the model of that most perfect
communion of Persons which is God himself." (Mulieris Dignitatem
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
n. 11)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, Jesus Christ reconciles
man to woman and woman to man, thereby enabling their reciprocated love-gifts
to joyfully image nothing less than
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Trinity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, as we have seen, this reconciliation
relies upon the masculinity of Christ, masculinity seems to be privileged
over femininity in salvation history.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This element of inequality seems
to be confirmed by the insistence upon reserving the ordained priesthood
to men: after all, if the masculinity of Christ is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; essential to His mission of healing
the rift between men and women, then those who image Him in His Gender
Mission must be men. And, their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masculinitymust be identified
with that mission, that is, with the laying down of one's life both in
the loving service to others and in the affirmation of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; woman's equality and dignity.
This means that the masculinity of ordained priests is iconic: it historically
links the current age to the Fall and to God's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gender Mission, thereby teaching
that none of us escapes the weaknesses of the Fall, nor the need of divine
mercy; it draws attention to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gender-specific weaknesses of
Original Sin, [End Page 122] thereby identifying the mission of masculinity
with loving service that includes affirming
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women; it images male-atonement
for sins against women, thereby reminding all that ordained priests function
as the image of The One, who as The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sacrificial Lamb atoned for all
sins, at all times and at all places. Ordained priests are thus double
icons of sacrificial atonement: their masculinity reflects
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Gender Mission of God; their
humanity, His Humanitarian Mission.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The iconic status of ordained priests
seems to promote sexual inequality in so far as ordaining only men seems
to entail (1) a restriction of Church
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authority to men; (2) a power
differential between men and women; and, most important, (3) an identification
of masculinity as being more important for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; salvation than femininity. In
regard to the first point, if it were the case that ordaining only men
restricts Church authority to men, then Church authority
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would stem from the sex, or the
gender, of the Church legislator rather than from the Cross. But the authority
of the Cross legislates obligations for all who
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would be saved by the Cross. Hence,
for example, verbal abuse and incest are wrong, not because they have been
proscribed by men, but because they
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; violate the maxims of human love
and despise the commands of the Creator-Redeemer. Furthermore, if Church
authority could reside only in men, then
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Church could not have recognized
women—especially those with a typically feminine theology, such as Therese
of Lisieux—as Doctors of the Faith.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to the second point,
I do not deny that ordaining only men creates a power differential between
men and women. However, if masculinity is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requisite for ordained priests
in so far as they image God's Gender Mission, then the resulting power
differential favors women. For, then, not only must
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; priests model that the mission
of masculinity lies in loving service that includes affirming the dignity
and equality of every woman, but priests must also
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oppose the mistreatment of woman—as
did Christ. If this be the gender meaning of contemporary masculinity,
then all men—but especially priests—are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thereby placed in the service
of woman: they must [End Page 123] honor—and promote—the truths of woman's
dignity and equality; they must
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subordinate—to these truths—the
inclinations arising from Original Sin that seek to dominate women; and
they must acknowledge that every woman has
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the right to require that her
dignity and equality be affirmed. In brief, man must fight against, or
compensate for, the weakness in masculinity that drives
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the desire for power over woman
by continually affirming woman. This affirmation within the Church must
honor the deepest truths about woman, that is,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the face of God is a feminine
face as much as it is a masculine face: she is man's equal in imaging God.
God's face was, is, and ever shall be the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face of love. This face is also
the face of every saint, whether man, woman, or youth; it is the face of
Christ. 21 To see the humanity of that face is to see
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divine love incarnated to restore
union with God; to see its masculinity is to see the need of man and woman
to overcome the gender weaknesses of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Original Sin. To insist on the
masculinity of ordained priests is to insist not only that these gender
weaknesses are still with us, but that ordained priests
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are to take on the Gender Mission
of Christ and be pro-woman. In this way, power is shifted away from chauvinism
and dominating men. This power shift
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not, however, create a new
form of 'reverse' sexual inequality; rather, it only begins to restore
the sexual equality once lost—and continually being
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lost—by the wounding of Original
Sin.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third and last point that ordaining
only men entails privileging masculinity over femininity is the strongest
basis for arguing that exclusively male
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ordination necessarily entails
gender inequality. However, gender inequality cannot result from privileging
masculinity if femininity is likewise privileged. In
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brief: either femininity is as
indispensable as masculinity to salvation, or gender inequality necessarily
results from the exclusively male priesthood. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Church cannot countenance any
version of gender inequality for three reasons. First, Genesis 1:27 directly
reveals that each sex equally images God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, gender inequality impairs
the equality requisite for striking the marriage contract as well as the
receptivity [End Page 124] and reciprocity so
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; essential to spousal love, since
spousal love involves each accepting the other as a love-gift and reciprocating
the same. Third, gender inequality
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compromises the ability of a loving
marriage to image the Trinity (wherein distinction is not inequality).
On the other hand, the Church cannot preclude
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gender inequality by ordaining
women, because that would also preclude the ability of the ordained priests
to image Christ in His Gender Mission.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the only viable option
for the Church is to hold that femininity is as necessary for salvation
as masculinity—even though its gender role is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the same as the gender role of
masculinity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Paul II implies that femininity
is as instrumental to salvation as masculinity, since salvation became
possible through the consent of a woman, 22
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and since none can be saved without
reciprocating the love of Christ as a bride accepts and responds to her
groom and since Scripture identifies the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Church as the Bride of Christ.
23 This identification of the Church's femininity with responsiveness links
the Church to the post-Fall status of women and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men; for just as Original Sin
makes the man's affirmation of woman's dignity and equality a prerequisite
for receiving her love, salvation requires that the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Church receive from the Lord the
love that she reciprocates to Him. To reciprocate the love of Christ is
to be His friend and to seek what He loves, both
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the totality of one's being
and with the distinctiveness of one's abilities and gifts. At this point,
oppositions between man/woman and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masculinity/femininity melt into
unanimity as each seeks whom Christ loves; or, as St. Paul said, "There
is neither male nor female; for you are all one in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ Jesus" (Gal. 3:28).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the unanimity of love need
not obliterate distinctiveness, it is not clear whether gender and its
roles are transcended within the realm of graced love.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24 However, it is clear that the
ever-present gender-specific weaknesses of Original Sin both within ourselves
and within our gender cultures ensure that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every fallen man and woman must
continually seek to overcome these weaknesses. Salvation cannot occur without
both the Bridegroom and the Bride;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; none are [End Page 125] saved
apart from Christ and His Church. 25 Together, through the unity of their
love, they birth—and rear—the children of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And together they image the Trinity—wherein
persons, unified in self-giving love, are distinct yet equal. As a result,
the gender roles of masculinity and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; femininity are equally indispensable
for salvation—even though they are distinct and even though being Christ
and being an ordained priest are identified as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; male gender roles. Gender equality
is thus, within John Paul II's theology, an analogous concept: masculinity
and femininity share the commonality of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being essential for salvation,
while retaining distinct salvific roles. Hence, their equality is one of
difference, that is to say, it is analogous. Accordingly,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither gender nor sexual inequality
results from reserving priestly ordination solely to men.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument that neither sexual
nor gender inequality results from the Church's practice of ordaining only
men can be briefly summarized as follows.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexual inequality began with Original
Sin; the restoration of sexual equality requires that the Savior and His
ordained ministers be male. This privileging of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masculinity in salvation history
would have caused gender inequality except for a similar privileging of
femininity. The privileging of femininity in salvation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; history began with the Virgin
Mary's indispensable consent to the incarnation and continues through the
femininity of the Church as the Bride of Christ.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The identification of Christ as
the bridegroom and the Church as the bride establishes that the gender
roles played by masculinity and femininity are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equally necessary for salvation,
although they are differentiated. In this way, sexual and gender equality
are not compromised—as they must not be. For
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any diminishment of equality would
impair the ability of the human race to image the Trinity through heterosexual
spousal love and would, thereby, cloud
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the divine message that trinitarian
love is our destiny. 26

This letterwriter also asserted: "Many other cultures openly accept polygamy.

constitutes the principal argument against
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the objectively injurious
and unjust situations which contain and express the inheritance of the
sin which all human beings bear within themselves. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; books of sacred Scripture confirm
in various places the actual existence of such situations and at the same
time proclaim the need for conversion, that is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to say, for purification from
evil and liberation from sin: from what offends neighbor, what "diminishes"
man, not only the one who is offended but also the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one who causes the offence. This

'feminine' nor 'masculine.'" The objection
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the Christ had to be male
in order to properly image God the Father attributes biological characteristics
to God; it forgets that the anthropological
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; language of Scripture does not
overcome the uniqueness of God. As John Paul II also points out in Mulieris
Dignitatem n. 8: "For biblical Revelation says
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that, while man's 'likeness' to
God is true, the 'non-likeness' which separates the whole of creation from
the Creator is still more essentially true."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12. Mulieris Dignitatem n. 8: "In
various passages the love of God who cares for his people is shown to be
like that of a mother: thus, like a mother God
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "has carried" humanity, and in
particular, his Chosen People, within his own womb; he has given birth
to it in travail, has nourished and comforted it (cf.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isa. 42:14; 46:3-4)." In this
paragraph, John Paul II also provides some of the references to God's feminine
attributes, namely, Isaiah 49:14-15 and 66:13;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 131:2-3.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13. A sign that a God's Humanitarian
Mission could have been accomplished by God incarnating in either sex is
found in salvation history: at various
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; critical moments, the human race
has been represented before God by men (Noah, Abraham, Moses) and by a
woman (the Virgin Mary). Cf. Mulieris
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dignitatem n. 11: ". . . to make
his Covenant with humanity, [God] addressed himself only to men: Noah,
Abraham, and Moses. At the beginning of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Covenant, which is to be eternal
and irrevocable, there is a woman: the Virgin of Nazareth. It is a sign
that points to the fact that 'in Jesus Christ'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There is neither male nor female'
(Gal. 3:28).In Christ the mutual opposition between man and woman—which
is the inheritance of original sin—is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially overcome. 'For you
are all one in Jesus Christ,' St Paul will write (ibid.).These words concern
that original 'unity of the two' which is linked with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the creation of the human being
as male and female, made in the image and likeness of God, and based on
the model of that most perfect communion of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persons which is God himself."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14. Mulieris Dignitatem n. 25:
"Christ has entered this history and remains in it as the Bridegroom who
'has given himself.' 'To give' means 'to become a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sincere gift' in the most complete
and radical way: 'Greater love has no man than this' (John 15:13)."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15. Gaudium et Spes n. 22. John
Paul II frequently cites this text and acknowledges that it "serves as
a constant reference point" of his teaching (Fides et
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ratio n. 60).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16. Leora Weitzman, conversational
point, January 2001. That this is also how Martha interpreted the words
of Christ is shown by their next encounter: He
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; asks her if she believes, she
responds, "I have come to believe. . ." (John 11:27).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17. Mulieris Dignitatem n. 15:
"[Christ] speaks to her of God's infinite gift of love, which is like a
'spring of water welling up to eternal life' (John 4:14). He
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speaks to her [the Samaritan woman]
about God who is Spirit, and about the true adoration which the Father
has a right to receive in spirit and truth (cf.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John 4:24). Finally he reveals
to her that he is the Messiah promised to Israel (cf. John 4:26). This
is an event without precedent: that a woman, . . . [has]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become a 'disciple' of Christ.
Indeed, once taught, she proclaims Christ to the inhabitants of Samaria,
so that they too receive him with faith (cf.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John4:39-42). This is an unprecedented
event, if one remembers the usual way women were treated by those who were
teachers in Israel; whereas in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus of Nazareth's way of acting
such an event becomes normal."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18. Cf. Mulieris Dignitatem n.
16: "From the beginning of Christ's mission, women show to him and to his
mystery a special sensitivity which is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characteristic of their femininity.
It must also be said that this is especially confirmed in the Paschal Mystery,
not only at the Cross but also at the dawn
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Resurrection. The women
are the first at the tomb. They are the first to find it empty. They are
the first to hear: 'He is not here. He has risen, as he
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said' (Matt. 28:6). They are the
first to embrace his feet (cf. Matt. 28:9). They are also the first to
be called to announce this truth to the Apostles (cf. Matt.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28:1-10; Luke 24:8-11)."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19. Mulieris Dignitatem n. 13:
"Jesus of Nazareth confirms this [feminine] dignity, recalls it, renews
it, and makes it a part of the Gospel and of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Redemption for which he is sent
into the world."

Spring 2001.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22. Mulieris Dignitatem n. 11:
"At the beginning of the New Covenant,. . . there is a woman: the Virgin
of Nazareth."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23. Mulieris Dignitatem n. 25:
". . . all human beings—both women and men—are called through the Church,
to be the 'Bride' of Christ, the Redeemer of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world. In this way, 'being
the bride,' and thus the 'feminine' element, becomes a symbol of all that
is 'human,' according to the words of Paul: 'There is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither male nor female; for you
are all one in Christ Jesus' (Gal. 3:28) . . . as members of the Church,
men too are included in the concept of 'Bride.' . . .
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Church every human being—male
and female—is the 'Bride,' in that he or she accepts the gift of the love
of Christ the Redeemer, and seeks to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; respond to it with the gift of
his or her own person." [sic].
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three comments. First, it should
be noted that this document's identification of femininity with responsiveness
is neither an identification of femininity with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passivity nor with subservience;
both of these are ruled out by scripture's identification of the feminine/masculine
spousal union as the image of the Trinity
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as well as by the friendship offered
to women by Christ: passivity and subservience properly characterize neither
spousal love nor friendship. Second, it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be noted that John Paul
II's argument that feminine responsiveness marks the response of every
human being to God signifies that just as Original
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sin precludes the ability for
women to acquire equality independently of male affirmation, it also precludes
the ability of any human to acquire salvation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; independently of Christ. This
means that feminine responsiveness to God's grace does not determine how
that responsiveness is expressed. As a result,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Church can respond with masculine
as well as feminine forms of piety. In brief: femininity's bridal imagery
does not necessitate that all adopt, for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example, the bridal mysticism
of St. Bernard of Clairvoux. Indeed, the Gender Mission of Christ and its
entailment of ordaining only men precludes the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assumption that there is no masculine
way to respond to God's love. Third, a more recent treatment of the Church's
femininity (in John Paul II's General
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audience of 7 February 2001) does
not characterize femininity in terms of responsiveness but rather in terms
of love and fruitfulness (n. 1): "The feminine
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; symbol represents the face of
the Church in her various aspects as betrothed, bride and mother, thus
stressing a dimension of love and fruitfulness."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24. If gender and its roles were
transcended by grace, the human race's sexual differentiation would not
need to be obliterated. For grace removes only
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imperfections. If sexual differentiation
were to be an imperfection of the human race, then the resurrection of
the dead, which removes all imperfections,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would transform women into men
and/or men into women, or all into asexual beings. Such transformations
belittle the significance of the human race
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being created as sexually differentiated
in order to image God. The iconic significance of sexual differentiation,
hence, precludes identifying sexual
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; differentiation as an imperfection
to be transcended by grace. Presupposed to this argument is the insight
that forms the cornerstone of Thomas Aquinas's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thought: grace perfects nature
without overthrowing it; see his Summa Theologiae I.62.5 and 7. The premise
concerning sexual differentiation and the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resurrection of the dead is discussed
by Prudence Allen, The Concept of Woman: The Aristotelian Revolution, 750
B.C.-A.D. 1250 (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1985),

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25. Three comments. First, the
salvific power of the Church is none other than the salvific grace of Jesus
Christ in whom and through whom all things were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; created with a unity that reflected
the Triune unity of God. "Christ is the image of the invisible God and
in Him all things came into being. He is before all
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creatures and in him all things
hold together" (Lumen Gentium n. 7). Original sin shattered creation's
unity; Christ restores it through His Church,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; animated by the Holy Spirit. As
explained in Lumen Gentium n. 7: "For by communicating his Spirit, Christ
mystically constitutes as his body those
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brothers of his who are called
together from every nation. . . . All the members [of this body/Church]
must be formed in his likeness, until Christ be formed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in them (cf. Gal. 4:19)." To so
reunify, or reanimate, the whole world with the spirit of Christ, God has
". . . willed to make men holy and save them, not as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individuals without any bond or
link between them, but rather to make them into a people who might acknowledge
him and serve him in holiness" (Lumen
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentium n. 9). The Church is thus,
according to the Catechism of the Catholic Church (2nd ed., n. 775), "...
the sacrament of the unity of the human race.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her, this unity is already
begun, since she gathers men 'from every nation, from all tribes and peoples
and tongues' (Rev.7:9)." Second, Christ calls
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every human being in every culture
and at every time to fulfillment in love. "Love is of God; every one who
loves is begotten by God and knows God" (1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John4:7). Accordingly, the Church
seeks to protect and purify "whatever good is found sown in the minds and
hearts of men or in the rites and customs of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; peoples" (Lumen Gentium n. 17).
Third, the Church saves—-through the grace of Christ—all with a good will.
As said in Lumen Gentium n. 16: "Those
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who, through no fault of their
own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless
seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grace, try in their action to
do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience—those
too may achieve eternal salvation. Nor shall divine
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; providence deny assistance necessary
for salvation to those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived
at an explicit knowledge of God, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who, not without grace, strive
to lead a good life."
