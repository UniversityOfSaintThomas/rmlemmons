<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font face="Arial">&quot;God’s promise and Jesus Christ’s 
resurrection raise in Christians the well-founded hope that a new and eternal 
dwelling place is prepared fro every human person, a new earth where justice 
abides. . . . This hope, rather than weaken, must instead strengthen concern for 
the work that is needed in the present reality.&quot; <i>Compendium</i> n. 56.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">My paper-in-progress critiques and discusses the 
American cultural forces – ism’s and philosophies – that serve to fragment 
lives. It argues that the fragmentation in our lives is real and problematic. It 
also examines how these forces interact dynamically to create significant, if 
unnecessary problems for women in professional life. Furthermore, women 
academics are not the only ones in this fragmentation, that it has dilatory 
effects on our work, emotional and familial effects, and spiritual effects. The 
solution requires acknowledging the sacred nature of our vocations as women and 
being guided by the Church to a life of prayer and continual discernment of 
God’s will for us. The Church offers us essential tools to help us integrate 
more effectively our lives at work, at home and in the faith. </font></b></p>

</i>
<p><b><font face="Arial">&quot;Work is a good thing for man - a good thing for his 
humanity - because through work man not only transforms nature, adapting it to 
his own needs, but he also achieves fulfillment as a human being and indeed, in 
a sense, becomes &quot;more a human being.&quot;</font></b><i><b><font face="Arial"> 
Laborem Exercens, 9.3</font></b></p>
</i>
<p><b><font face="Arial">was written as a commentary on a letter attributed to 
St. Thomas, written to a certain Brother John; the letter was entitled: Precepts 
for Acquiring the Treasure of Knowledge.<sup>1</sup> The letter itself can be 
found in the library under the title <i>De Modo Studendi (How to Study).</i> The 
book is devoted to an investigation of what St. Thomas says concerning the 
&quot;management of the mind.&quot; Both Sertillanges and Aquinas have much to say on how 
anyone wishing to pursue the life of the mind might do so in the midst of the 
complexities of the active life. My paper will consider the meaning of this work 
for the professional woman seeking to integrate the life of the intellect with 
her vocation as woman and mother. Especially important are Sertlillanges’s 
arguments that the spiritual life plays an indispensable role in the pursuit of 
the true and the good, that it is important to avoid being a dilettante and 
falling prey to an unbridled curiosity, and that the &quot;most valuable thing of all 
is will, a deeply rooted will.&quot; In this session, we consider several questions: 
can we admit that the fragmentation we experience is, at least in part, 
attributable to a lack of will? If we grant that women are vital for reclaiming 
the culture of life, what are the virtues that women pursuing an intellectual 
vocation need to acquire to fulfill their destinies as women? How shall we live 
our lives so that we can fully occupy the place to which God has called us?</font></b></p>

<i>Von Hildebrand and the Contemporary Woman</i></font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">&quot;[T]he Second Vatican Council... declares in its 
Closing Message: ‘The hour is coming, in fact has come, when the vocation of 
women is being acknowledged in its fullness, the hour in which women acquire in 
the world an influence, an effect and a power never hitherto achieved. That is 
why, at his moment when the human race is undergoing so deep a transformation, 
women imbued with a spirit of the Gospel can do so much to aid humanity in not 
falling.’&quot; <i>Mulieris Dignitatem</i> n. 1.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">We begin by reflecting on the meaning of 
&quot;fragmentation&quot; as applied to daily life and some suggestions (borrowed from Dom 
Hubert von Zeller) on how we might integrate work with prayer and family life. 
Then we turn to Alice von Hildebrand's provocative new book <i>The Privilege of 
Being a Woman </i>and discuss her central themes such as the implications 
(positive and negative) of being the &quot;weaker&quot; sex, women's unique Christian 
mission, the nature of feelings and their proper role in our spirituality, and 
Mary as a model of women's vocation.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">&quot;[I]llumined by the light of reason, human beings know 
how to discover the way, but they can follow it to its end, quickly and 
unhindered, only if with a rightly tuned spirit they introduce the perspective 
of faith into their inquiry. Therefore, reason and faith cannot be separated 
without diminishing the capacity of men and women to understand themselves, the 
world, and God in a coherent way.&quot; (<i>Fides et Ratio</i>, #16, translated by 
Alfred Freddoso).</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">In commenting on Blaise Pascal’s Pensées, Thomas Morris 
emphasizes the importance of (a) addressing ultimate philosophical and 
theological questions and (b) living an integrated life, a life that integrates 
the intellectual, the spiritual, and the physical aspects of one’s experience. 
Alfred Freddoso has also called attention to the importance of leading an 
integrated life. More specifically, drawing on the Catholic Intellectual 
Tradition, he argues that in order to adequately and fully address philosophical 
questions, one must draw on theology, lead an upright moral life, and cultivate 
a rich spiritual life. Drawing on the work of these philosophers, I have 
reflected upon how one might introduce students to questions about the 
relationship between philosophical inquiry and spiritual practice. Some of these 
reflections are contained within a recent paper (that I distributed to the 
group), a paper in which I discuss ways of giving interested students resources 
they could use in efforts to integrate their intellectual lives and their 
spiritual lives. In addition to this paper, I distributed helpful material from 
the works of Pascal, Morris, and Freddoso. </font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font face="Arial">Mary Lemmons<span lang="en-us">, Ph.D.</span><i> 
Contemplation as the Key to Integration</i></font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">&quot;Love is of God; Everyone who loves is begotten by God 
and knows God.&quot; 1 John 4:7.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">The fragmentation of woman’s lives can only be overcome 
by two kinds of contemplation. First and foremost, we need the contemplation of 
which the philosophers speak, namely, the contemplation of God, who alone makes 
sense of our lives. But since this type of contemplation requires solitude, it 
is interrupted by the exigencies of active lives. For this reason, we also need 
the contemplation of Christ of which Mother Teresa speaks, whereby we 
contemplate the Christ in the face of those who are suffering. Mother Teresa 
thus identifies the way in which the contemplative and the active life can be 
united in love of Christ. Saint Therese of Lisieux also assists us to understand 
this active form of contemplative love insofar as she argues that any act can be 
an act of love. This gender contribution to the proper understanding of 
eudaimonia, however indispensable for integrating the lives of women, does not 
suffice to end all types of fragmentation. For there are three types of 
fragmentation due to whether fragmentation is caused by the absence of meaning, 
the presence of intense personal suffering, or overwhelming tasks. The first two 
types of fragmentation can be healed through lovingly contemplating God; the 
last type requires one to integrate daily reflections that enable her to realize 
that her life has a certain extension in time that puts her into contact with 
eudaimonic goods—not simultaneously but sequentially. These contemplative 
reflections enable one to realize that it is possible to organize life so that 
it has a certain form whereby one comes into contact with eudaimonic goods. This 
is to contemplate the prudential relationship between one’s actions and 
eudaimonia; it is to practice—what I call—&quot;prudential contemplation.&quot; Prudential 
contemplation heals the fragmentation caused by overwhelming tasks by enabling 
one to realize that there is a rhythm to life that allows one’s life to be real 
and meaningful as long as over time one attains to eudaimonic goods, i.e., those 
goods which makes life meaningful, namely, loving God and neighbor either 
through intellectual or practical activities. </font></b></p>
