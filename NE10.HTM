<p>&nbsp; If happiness is activity in accordance with excellence, it is
reasonable that it should be in accordance with the highest excellence;
and this will be that of the best thing in us. Whether it be intellect
or something else that is this element which is thought to be our natural
ruler and guide and to take thought of things noble and divine, whether
it be itself also divine or only the most divine element in us, the activity
of this in accordance with its proper excellence will be complete happiness.
<b>That this activity is contemplative we have already said.</b>

<p>&nbsp;<i>Now this would seem to be in agreement both with what we said
before and with the truth.</i> For this activity is the <i>best</i> (since
not only is intellect the best thing in us, but the objects of intellect
are the best of knowable objects); and, secondly, it is the <i>most continuous,</i>
since we can contemplate truth more continuously than we can do anything.
And we think happiness has pleasure mingled with it, but the activity of
wisdom is admittedly <i>the pleasantest</i> of excellent activities; at
all events philosophy is thought to offer pleasures marvellous for their
<i>purity </i>and their <i>enduringness</i>, and it is to be expected that
those who know will pass their time more pleasantly than those who inquire.
And the <i>self-sufficiency</i> that is spoken of must belong most to the
contemplative activity. For while a wise man, as well as a just man and
the rest, needs the necessaries of life, when they are sufficiently equipped
with things of that sort the just man needs people towards whom and with
whom he shall act justly, and the temperate man, the brave man, and each
of the others is in the same case, but the wise man, even when by himself,
can contemplate truth, and the better the wiser he is; he can perhaps do
so better if he has fellow-workers, but still he is the most self-sufficient.
And this activity alone would seem to be <i>loved for its own sake;</i>
for nothing arises from it apart from the contemplating, while from practical
activities we gain more or less apart from the action. And happiness is
thought to depend on <i>leisure</i>; for we are busy that we may have leisure,
and make war that we may live in peace. Now the <i>activity of the practical
excellences is exhibited in political or military affairs,</i> but the
actions concerned with these seem to be unleisurely. Warlike actions are
completely so (for no one chooses to be at war, or provokes war, for the
sake of being at war; any one would seem absolutely murderous if he were
to make enemies of his friends in order to bring about battle and slaughter);
but the action of the statesman is also unleisurely, and--apart from the
political action itself--aims at despotic power and honours, or at all
events happiness, for him and his fellow citizens--a happiness different
from political action, and evidently sought as being different. So if among
excellent actions political and military actions are distinguished by nobility
and greatness, and these are unleisurely and aim at an end and are not
desirable for their own sake, but<i> the activity of intellect, which is
contemplative, seems both to be superior in worth and to aim at no end
beyond itself, and to have its pleasure proper to itself (and this augments
the activity), and the self-sufficiency, leisureliness, unweariedness (so
far as this is possible for man), and all the other attributes ascribed
to the blessed man are evidently those connected with this activity,</i>
it follows that <b>this will be the complete happiness </b>of man, if it
be allowed a complete term of life (for none of the attributes of happiness
is incomplete).

<p>&nbsp;But such a life would be too high for man; for it is not in so
far as he is man that he will live so, but in so far as something divine
is present in him; and by so much as this is superior to our composite
nature is its activity superior to that which is the exercise of the other
kind of excellence. If intellect is divine, then, in comparison with man,
the life according to it is divine in comparison with human life. But we
must not follow those who advise us, being men, to think of human things,
and, being mortal, of mortal things, but must, so far as we can, make ourselves
immortal, and <i>strain every nerve to live in accordance with the best
thing in us</i>; for even if it be small in bulk, much more does it in
power and worth surpass everything. This would seem, too, to be each man
himself, since it is the authoritative and better part of him. It would
be strange, then, if he were to choose not the life of himself but that
of something else. And what we said before will apply now;<b> that which
is proper to each thing is by nature best and most pleasant for each thing;</b>
for man, therefore, the life according to intellect is best and pleasantest,
since intellect more than anything else is man. This life therefore is
also the happiest.
