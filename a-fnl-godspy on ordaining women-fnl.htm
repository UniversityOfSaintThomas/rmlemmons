<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The refusal of the Catholic Church to ordain women as priests has left many feeling
that the Church considers women to be inferior to men &#8211; despite her proclamations of sexual
equality and despite the papal argument of <i>Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i>. In that document, John
Paul II argues that the Church lacks the authority to ordain women, since Christ did not appoint
women as apostles and since the historical tradition has restricted priestly ordination to men. </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The historical nature of this argument has not been very persuasive due to the
conviction that masculinity is irrelevant for being a priest in the image of Christ. This conviction,
however, presupposes that masculinity is irrelevant for the mission of Christ. But this is not
true. The mission of Christ is to remedy the effects of Original Sin. </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><i>Genesis</i> points out that Original Sin caused the loss of union between the human race
and God as well as between man and woman. As a result, Christ had an humanitarian mission
to restore unity with God and a gender mission to restore heterosexual unity. The humanitarian
mission required that Christ be fully human and fully God. Accordingly, since women are as
human as men, God could have incarnated as a woman. A female Christ could have restored
the human race to its original unity with God. It is not Christ&#8217;s humanitarian mission that
required Christ to be male. </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The maleness of Christ is rather required in order to restore the unity between men and
women destroyed by Original Sin; for, as put in Genesis 3:16, &#8220;Your desire will be for your
husband, and he will rule over you." This passage indicates three gender consequences of
Original Sin: the excessive desire or obsession of women for their men, male domination over
women and sexual inequality. Freeing the human race from these consequences of Original
Sin constitute Christ&#8217;s gender mission. </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>These consequences are significant. In his letter &#8220;On the Dignity and Vocation of
Women,&#8221; John Paul II identifies male domination with chauvinism and blames it for the many
ways in which women suffer from the lack of proper appreciation for her equality and dignity.
Chauvinism &#8211; as a consequence of Original Sin &#8211; necessitated that the Christ be a man.<span style="font-size: 12pt"> </span>For,
due to chauvinism, a female Christ would not have been recognized by men as being their
lord, their rabbi, their savior. Christ exemplified sacrificial love, which chauvinism identifies as a
weakness and as a peculiarity of women. According to chauvinism, maleness is about
strength, independence, power, and control.  Not so, taught Christ; rather, masculinity is for the
sake of pouring out one&#8217;s life for another in love, not for the sake of dominating self-gratification.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Fallen women also needed Christ to be incarnated as a man&#8212;and not only to teach
men a lesson. For, Original Sin weakened femininity to the point where it blinded women to the
truth about her desire for love. Original Sin derailed woman&#8217;s transcendent passion for God
with an egocentric passion for man&#8212;for a Mr. Right able to satisfy the yearnings of her heart.
Fallen woman thus assumes either that Mr. Right will be perfect or that accommodating his
chauvinism will be the sacrifice that enables her to be loved. Thus, woman needs not only to
be freed from the harms of chauvinism but also from the misdirection of her desire. Women
need to learn not only that there can only be one perfect man, Jesus Christ, but also that men
need not be chauvinistic. If Christ had been incarnated as a woman, these lessons would have
been untaught. Thus, the Gender Mission of Christ required Christ to be incarnated as a man
for the sake of women as well as for the sake of men. </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>If Christ had to be incarnated as a man in order to fulfill his Gender Mission, then it is
not possible for women to undertake this mission. If it is not possible for women to undertake
the Gender Mission, then it is not possible for women to be ordained Catholic priests. For the
Catholic priest images Christ in His gender mission as well as in His humanitarian mission. This
is particularly the case since the Catholic Church was founded as the way to counter the
effects of Original Sin.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Furthermore, since the refusal of the Catholic Church to ordain women is grounded on
the gender mission of Christ, it is a refusal that promotes sexual equality. It is incredibly
important that the Church promote sexual equality&#8212;for two reasons. First, sexual equality
counters the harmful gender inequities of Original Sin. Secondly, as John Paul II points out, it
is only when spouses recognize and appreciate the equality of the other that they are able to
appreciate properly the other&#8217;s spousal gift of self. Without this appreciation, marriages fail to
properly image the loving equality of the Trinity. But we are made in the image of God and we
love best when we love as God loves. As John Paul II puts it in <i>Mulieris Dignitatem</i> n.7:</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 1in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&#8220;The fact that man &#8216;created as man and woman&#8217; is the image of God means not
only that each of them individually is like God, as a rational and free being. It
also means that man and woman, created as a &#8216;unity of the two&#8217; in their
common humanity, are called to live in a communion of love, and in this way to
mirror in the world the communion of love that is in God, through which the
Three Persons love each other in the intimate mystery of the one divine life.&#8221; </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In other words, the mission of heterosexual love is to image Trinitarian love, which is between
distinct equals. Love thus requires the Church to promote sexual equality. </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Therefore, the promotion of sexual equality, Trinitarian love, and faithfulness to the
missions of Christ requires the Catholic Church to forgo ordaining women. By so doing, not
only does she proclaim the importance of Christ&#8217;s male incarnation and the need for ordained
priests to image His Gender Mission, but she also honors her Savior.</span></span></p>
