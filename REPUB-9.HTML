<blockquote><a NAME="start"></a><a NAME="10"></a>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS&nbsp;<a NAME="11"></a>

<p>Last of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more&nbsp;<a NAME="12"></a>to
ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live,&nbsp;<a NAME="13"></a>in
happiness or in misery?&nbsp;<a NAME="14"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.&nbsp;<a N AME="15"></a>
<br>There is, however, I said, a previous question which remains&nbsp;<a NAME="16"></a>unanswered.&nbsp;<a NAME="17"></a>

<p>What question?&nbsp;<a NAME="18"></a>
<br>I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number&nbsp;<a NAME="19"></a>of
the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always&nbsp;<a NAME="20"></a>be
confused.&nbsp;<a NAME="21"></a>

<p>Well, he said, it is not too late to supply the&nbsp;<a NAME="22"></a>omission.&nbsp;<a NAME="23"></a>
<br>Very true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand:&nbsp;<a NAME="24"></a>Certain
of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be unlawful;&nbsp;<a NAME="25"></a>every
one appears to have them, but in some persons they are controlled&nbsp;<a NAME="26"></a>by
the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail over them-either&nbsp;<a NAME="27"></a>they
are wholly banished or they become few and weak; while in the case&nbsp;<a NAME="28"></a>of
others they a
re stronger, and there are more of them.&nbsp;<a NAME="29"></a>

<p>Which appetites do you mean?&nbsp;<a NAME="30"></a>
<br>I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling&nbsp;<a NAME="31"></a>power
is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or drink,&nbsp;<a NAME="32"></a>starts
up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his desires;&nbsp;<a NAME="33"></a>and
there is no conceivable folly or crime --not excepting incest or any&nbsp;<a NAME="34"></a>oth
er
unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of forbidden food --which&nbsp;<a NAME="35"></a>at
such a time, when he has parted company with all shame and sense, a&nbsp;<a NAME="36"></a>man
may not be ready to commit.&nbsp;<a NAME="37"></a>

<p>Most true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="38"></a>
<br>But when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going&nbsp;<a NAME="39"></a>to
sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble thoughts&nbsp;<a NAME="40"></a>and
enquiries, co
llecting himself in meditation; after having first indulged&nbsp;<a NAME="41"></a>his
appetites neither too much nor too little, but just enough to lay them&nbsp;<a NAME="42"></a>to
sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering&nbsp;<a NAME="43"></a>with
the higher principle --which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction,&nbsp;<a NAME="44"></a>free
to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown, whether&nbsp;<a NAME="45"></a>in
past, present, or future: when 
again he has allayed the passionate element,&nbsp;<a NAME="46"></a>if
he has a quarrel against any one --I say, when, after pacifying the&nbsp;<a NAME="47"></a>two
irrational principles, he rouses up the third, which is reason, before&nbsp;<a NAME="48"></a>he
takes his rest, then, as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and&nbsp;<a NAME="49"></a>is
least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless&nbsp;<a NAME="50"></a>visions.&nbsp;<a NAME="51"></a>

<p>I quite agree.&nbsp;<a NAME="52"></a>
<br>In saying this I have been running into a digression; but the point&nbsp;<a NAME="53"></a>which
I desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is&nbsp;<a NAME="54"></a>a
lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. Pray, consider whether&nbsp;<a NAME="55"></a>I
am right, and you agree with me.&nbsp;<a NAME="56"></a>

<p>Yes, I agree.&nbsp;<a NAME="57"></a>
<br>And now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic&nbsp;<a NAME="58"></a>man.
He was supposed fro
m his youth upwards to have been trained under&nbsp;<a NAME="59"></a>a
miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but discountenanced&nbsp;<a NAME="60"></a>the
unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and ornament?&nbsp;<a NAME="61"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="62"></a>
<br>And then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort&nbsp;<a NAME="63"></a>of
people, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite&nbsp;<a NAME="64"></a>extreme
from an abhorrence of
 his father's meanness. At last, being a better&nbsp;<a NAME="65"></a>man
than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until he halted&nbsp;<a NAME="66"></a>midway
and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but of what he&nbsp;<a NAME="67"></a>deemed
moderate indulgence in various pleasures. After this manner the&nbsp;<a NAME="68"></a>democrat
was generated out of the oligarch?&nbsp;<a NAME="69"></a>

<p>Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so&nbsp;<a NAME="70"></a>still.&amp;nbs
p;<a NAME="71"></a>
<br>And now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive&nbsp;<a NAME="72"></a>this
man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his father's&nbsp;<a NAME="73"></a>principles.&nbsp;<a NAME="74"></a>

<p>I can imagine him.&nbsp;<a NAME="75"></a>
<br>Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which&nbsp;<a NAME="76"></a>has
already happened to the father: --he is drawn into a perfectly lawless&nbsp;<a NAME="77"></a>life,
which by his 
seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his father and&nbsp;<a NAME="78"></a>friends
take part with his moderate desires, and the opposite party assist&nbsp;<a NAME="79"></a>the
opposite ones. As soon as these dire magicians and tyrant-makers find&nbsp;<a NAME="80"></a>that
they are losing their hold on him, they contrive to implant in him&nbsp;<a NAME="81"></a>a
master passion, to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts --a sort&nbsp;<a NAME="82"></a>of
monstrous winged drone --that is the only im
age which will adequately&nbsp;<a NAME="83"></a>describe
him.&nbsp;<a NAME="84"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of&nbsp;<a NAME="85"></a>him.&nbsp;<a NAME="86"></a>
<br>And when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands&nbsp;<a NAME="87"></a>and
wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let loose, come&nbsp;<a NAME="88"></a>buzzing
around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which&nbsp;<a NAME="89"></a>they
implant in his drone-l
ike nature, then at last this lord of the soul,&nbsp;<a NAME="90"></a>having
Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks out into a frenzy:&nbsp;<a NAME="91"></a>and
if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of&nbsp;<a NAME="92"></a>formation,
and there is in him any sense of shame remaining, to these better&nbsp;<a NAME="93"></a>principles
he puts an end, and casts them forth until he has purged away&nbsp;<a NAME="94"></a>temperance
and brought in madness to the full.&nbsp;<a N AME="95"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is&nbsp;<a NAME="96"></a>generated.&nbsp;<a NAME="97"></a>

<p>And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a&nbsp;<a NAME="98"></a>tyrant?&nbsp;<a NAME="99"></a>
<br>I should not wonder.&nbsp;<a NAME="100"></a>
<br>Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a&nbsp;<a NAME="101"></a>tyrant?&nbsp;<a NAME="102"></a>
<br>He has.&nbsp;<a NAME="103"></a>
<br>And you know that a man who is deranged and
 not right in his mind,&nbsp;<a NAME="104"></a>will
fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the&nbsp;<a NAME="105"></a>gods?&nbsp;<a NAME="106"></a>

<p>That he will.&nbsp;<a NAME="107"></a>
<br>And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being&nbsp;<a NAME="108"></a>when,
either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes&nbsp;<a NAME="109"></a>drunken,
lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that&nbsp;<a NAME="110"></a>so?&nbsp;<a NAME="1
11"></a>

<p>Assuredly.&nbsp;<a NAME="112"></a>
<br>Such is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he&nbsp;<a NAME="113"></a>live?&nbsp;<a NAME="114"></a>
<br>Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell&nbsp;<a NAME="115"></a>me.&nbsp;<a NAME="116"></a>
<br>I imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will&nbsp;<a NAME="117"></a>be
feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort&nbsp;<a NAME="118"></a>of
thing; Love is the lord of the hous
e within him, and orders all the&nbsp;<a NAME="119"></a>concerns
of his soul.&nbsp;<a NAME="120"></a>

<p>That is certain.&nbsp;<a NAME="121"></a>
<br>Yes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,&nbsp;<a NAME="122"></a>and
their demands are many.&nbsp;<a NAME="123"></a>

<p>They are indeed, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="124"></a>
<br>His revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.&nbsp;<a NAME="125"></a>
<br>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="126"></a>
<br>Then comes debt and the cutting down of
 his property.&nbsp;<a NAME="127"></a>
<br>Of course.&nbsp;<a NAME="128"></a>
<br>When he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest&nbsp;<a NAME="129"></a>like
young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them,&nbsp;<a NAME="130"></a>and
especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them,&nbsp;<a NAME="131"></a>is
in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil&nbsp;<a NAME="132"></a>of
his property, in order that he may gratify th
em?&nbsp;<a NAME="133"></a>

<p>Yes, that is sure to be the case.&nbsp;<a NAME="134"></a>
<br>He must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains&nbsp;<a NAME="135"></a>and
pangs.&nbsp;<a NAME="136"></a>

<p>He must.&nbsp;<a NAME="137"></a>
<br>And as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new&nbsp;<a NAME="138"></a>got
the better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger&nbsp;<a NAME="139"></a>will
claim to have more than his father and his mother, 
and if he has spent&nbsp;<a NAME="140"></a>his
own share of the property, he will take a slice of&nbsp;<a NAME="141"></a>theirs.&nbsp;<a NAME="142"></a>

<p>No doubt he will.&nbsp;<a NAME="143"></a>
<br>And if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all&nbsp;<a NAME="144"></a>to
cheat and deceive them.&nbsp;<a NAME="145"></a>

<p>Very true.&nbsp;<a NAME="146"></a>
<br>And if he fails, then he will use force and plunder&nbsp;<a NAME="147"></a>them.&nbsp;<a NAME="148"></a>
<br>Yes, p
robably.&nbsp;<a NAME="149"></a>
<br>And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?&nbsp;<a NAME="150"></a>Will
the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over&nbsp;<a NAME="151"></a>them?&nbsp;<a NAME="152"></a>

<p>Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his&nbsp;<a NAME="153"></a>parents.&nbsp;<a NAME="154"></a>

<p>But, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some newfangled love&nbsp;<a NAME="155"></a>of
a harlot, who is anything but a necessary conne
ction, can you believe&nbsp;<a NAME="156"></a>that
he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary&nbsp;<a NAME="157"></a>to
his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the other,&nbsp;<a NAME="158"></a>when
she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under like circumstances,&nbsp;<a NAME="159"></a>he
would do the same to his withered old father, first and most indispensable&nbsp;<a NAME="160"></a>of
friends, for the sake of some newly found blooming you
th who is the&nbsp;<a NAME="161"></a>reverse
of indispensable?&nbsp;<a NAME="162"></a>

<p>Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.&nbsp;<a NAME="163"></a>
<br>Truly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and&nbsp;<a NAME="164"></a>mother.&nbsp;<a NAME="165"></a>

<p>He is indeed, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="166"></a>
<br>He first takes their property, and when that falls, and pleasures are&nbsp;<a NAME="167"></a>beginning
to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks int
o a house,&nbsp;<a NAME="168"></a>or
steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds to clear&nbsp;<a NAME="169"></a>a
temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child, and which&nbsp;<a NAME="170"></a>gave
judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those others which&nbsp;<a NAME="171"></a>have
just been emancipated, and are now the bodyguard of love and share&nbsp;<a NAME="172"></a>his
empire. These in his democratic days, when he was still subject to&nbsp;<a NAME="173
"></a>the
laws and to his father, were only let loose in the dreams of sleep.&nbsp;<a NAME="174"></a>But
now that he is under the dominion of love, he becomes always and in&nbsp;<a NAME="175"></a>waking
reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only; he will&nbsp;<a NAME="176"></a>commit
the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food, or be guilty of any other&nbsp;<a NAME="177"></a>horrid
act. Love is his tyrant, and lives lordly in him and lawlessly,&nbsp;<a NAME="178"></a>and
being himself a k
ing, leads him on, as a tyrant leads a State, to the&nbsp;<a NAME="179"></a>performance
of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the&nbsp;<a NAME="180"></a>rabble
of his associates, whether those whom evil communications have brought&nbsp;<a NAME="181"></a>in
from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within&nbsp;<a NAME="182"></a>him
by reason of a similar evil nature in himself. Have we not here a picture&nbsp;<a NAME="183"></a>of
his way of life?&nbsp;<a NAME="184"></a>

<p>Yes, indeed, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="185"></a>
<br>And if there are only a few of them in the State, the rest of the people&nbsp;<a NAME="186"></a>are
well disposed, they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers&nbsp;<a NAME="187"></a>of
some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war; and if there&nbsp;<a NAME="188"></a>is
no war, they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the&nbsp;<a NAME="189"></a>city.&nbsp;<a NAME="190"></a>

<p>What sort of mi
schief?&nbsp;<a NAME="191"></a>
<br>For example, they are the thieves, burglars, cutpurses, footpads, robbers&nbsp;<a NAME="192"></a>of
temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to speak&nbsp;<a NAME="193"></a>they
turn informers, and bear false witness, and take&nbsp;<a NAME="194"></a>bribes.&nbsp;<a NAME="195"></a>

<p>A small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are&nbsp;<a NAME="196"></a>few
in number.&nbsp;<a NAME="197"></a>

<p>Yes, I said; but small and great
 are comparative terms, and all&nbsp;<a NAME="198"></a>these
things, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do&nbsp;<a NAME="199"></a>not
come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class&nbsp;<a NAME="200"></a>and
their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,&nbsp;<a NAME="201"></a>assisted
by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among themselves&nbsp;<a NAME="202"></a>the
one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, and him they
 create&nbsp;<a NAME="203"></a>their
tyrant.&nbsp;<a NAME="204"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a&nbsp;<a NAME="205"></a>tyrant.&nbsp;<a NAME="206"></a>
<br>If the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began&nbsp;<a NAME="207"></a>by
beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he beats&nbsp;<a NAME="208"></a>them,
and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the Cretans&nbsp;<a NAME="209"></a>say,
in subjection to his young 
retainers whom he has introduced to be&nbsp;<a NAME="210"></a>their
rulers and masters. This is the end of his passions and&nbsp;<a NAME="211"></a>desires.&nbsp;<a NAME="212"></a>

<p>Exactly.&nbsp;<a NAME="213"></a>
<br>When such men are only private individuals and before they get power,&nbsp;<a NAME="214"></a>this
is their character; they associate entirely with their own flatterers&nbsp;<a NAME="215"></a>or
ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they in their turn&nbsp;<a NAME="216"></a>are
equally ready to bow down before them: they profess every sort of affection&nbsp;<a NAME="217"></a>for
them; but when they have gained their point they know them no&nbsp;<a NAME="218"></a>more.&nbsp;<a NAME="219"></a>

<p>Yes, truly.&nbsp;<a NAME="220"></a>
<br>They are always either the masters or servants and never the friends&nbsp;<a NAME="221"></a>of
anybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or&nbsp;<a NAME="222"></a>friendship.&nbsp;<a NAME="223"></a>

<p>Certainly not.&nbsp;<a NA ME="224"></a>
<br>And may we not rightly call such men treacherous?&nbsp;<a NAME="225"></a>
<br>No question.&nbsp;<a NAME="226"></a>
<br>Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of&nbsp;<a NAME="227"></a>justice?&nbsp;<a NAME="228"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.&nbsp;<a NAME="229"></a>
<br>Let us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man:&nbsp;<a NAME="230"></a>he
is the waking reality of what we dreamed.&nbsp;<a NAME="231"></a>

<p>Most 
true.&nbsp;<a NAME="232"></a>
<br>And this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and&nbsp;<a NAME="233"></a>the
longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.&nbsp;<a NAME="234"></a>

<p>Socrates - GLAUCON&nbsp;<a NAME="235"></a>

<p>That is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to&nbsp;<a NAME="236"></a>answer.&nbsp;<a NAME="237"></a>
<br>And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the&nbsp;<a NAME="238"></a>most
miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest a
nd most, most continually&nbsp;<a NAME="239"></a>and
truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in&nbsp;<a NAME="240"></a>general?&nbsp;<a NAME="241"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, inevitably.&nbsp;<a NAME="242"></a>
<br>And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical, State, and&nbsp;<a NAME="243"></a>the
democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the&nbsp;<a NAME="244"></a>others?&nbsp;<a NAME="245"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="246"></a>
<br>And as State is
 to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation&nbsp;<a NAME="247"></a>to
man?&nbsp;<a NAME="248"></a>

<p>To be sure.&nbsp;<a NAME="249"></a>
<br>Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city&nbsp;<a NAME="250"></a>which
is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?&nbsp;<a NAME="251"></a>

<p>They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best&nbsp;<a NAME="252"></a>and
the other is the very worst.&nbsp;<a NAME="253"></a>

<p>There can be no m
istake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore&nbsp;<a NAME="254"></a>I
will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about&nbsp;<a NAME="255"></a>their
relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow ourselves&nbsp;<a NAME="256"></a>to
be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is only a unit&nbsp;<a NAME="257"></a>and
may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us go as we ought&nbsp;<a NAME="258"></a>into
every corner of the city and look all 
about, and then we will give&nbsp;<a NAME="259"></a>our
opinion.&nbsp;<a NAME="260"></a>

<p>A fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that&nbsp;<a NAME="261"></a>a
tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king&nbsp;<a NAME="262"></a>the
happiest.&nbsp;<a NAME="263"></a>

<p>And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request,&nbsp;<a NAME="264"></a>that
I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human&nbsp;<a NAME="265"></a>nature?
He must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled&nbsp;<a NAME="266"></a>at
the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder,&nbsp;<a NAME="267"></a>but
let him be one who has a clear insight. May I suppose that the judgment&nbsp;<a NAME="268"></a>is
given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge, and has&nbsp;<a NAME="269"></a>dwelt
in the same place with him, and been present at his dally life and&nbsp;<a NAME="270"></a>known
him in hi
s family relations, where he may be seen stripped of his&nbsp;<a NAME="271"></a>tragedy
attire, and again in the hour of public danger --he shall tell&nbsp;<a NAME="272"></a>us
about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other&nbsp;<a NAME="273"></a>men?&nbsp;<a NAME="274"></a>

<p>That again, he said, is a very fair proposal.&nbsp;<a NAME="275"></a>
<br>Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and&nbsp;<a NAME="276"></a>have
before now met with such a perso
n? We shall then have some one who&nbsp;<a NAME="277"></a>will
answer our enquiries.&nbsp;<a NAME="278"></a>

<p>By all means.&nbsp;<a NAME="279"></a>
<br>Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the&nbsp;<a NAME="280"></a>State;
bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other&nbsp;<a NAME="281"></a>of
them, will you tell me their respective conditions?&nbsp;<a NAME="282"></a>

<p>What do you mean? he asked.&nbsp;<a NAME="283"></a>
<br>Beginning with the Stat
e, I replied, would you say that a city which&nbsp;<a NAME="284"></a>is
governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?&nbsp;<a NAME="285"></a>

<p>No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.&nbsp;<a NAME="286"></a>
<br>And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a&nbsp;<a NAME="287"></a>State?&nbsp;<a NAME="288"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, I see that there are --a few; but the people, speaking&nbsp;<a NAME="289"></a>generally,
and the best of them, are miserably degraded and&nbsp;<a NAME="290"></a>enslaved.&nbsp;<a NAME="291"></a>

<p>Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule&nbsp;<a NAME="292"></a>prevail?
his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity --the best elements&nbsp;<a NAME="293"></a>in
him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the&nbsp;<a NAME="294"></a>worst
and maddest.&nbsp;<a NAME="295"></a>

<p>Inevitably.&nbsp;<a NAME="296"></a>
<br>And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman,&nbsp;<a N AME="297"></a>or
of a slave?&nbsp;<a NAME="298"></a>

<p>He has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.&nbsp;<a NAME="299"></a>
<br>And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable&nbsp;<a NAME="300"></a>of
acting voluntarily?&nbsp;<a NAME="301"></a>

<p>Utterly incapable.&nbsp;<a NAME="302"></a>
<br>And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul&nbsp;<a NAME="303"></a>taken
as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is&nbsp;<a NAME="304"></a>
a
gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and&nbsp;<a NAME="305"></a>remorse?&nbsp;<a NAME="306"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="307"></a>
<br>And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or&nbsp;<a NAME="308"></a>poor?&nbsp;<a NAME="309"></a>
<br>Poor.&nbsp;<a NAME="310"></a>
<br>And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and&nbsp;<a NAME="311"></a>insatiable?&nbsp;<a NAME="312"></a>
<br>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="313"></a>
<br>And must not such a State and such a man be always full of&nbsp;
<a NAME="314"></a>fear?&nbsp;<a NAME="315"></a>
<br>Yes, indeed.&nbsp;<a NAME="316"></a>
<br>Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow&nbsp;<a NAME="317"></a>and
groaning and pain?&nbsp;<a NAME="318"></a>

<p>Certainly not.&nbsp;<a NAME="319"></a>
<br>And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery&nbsp;<a NAME="320"></a>than
in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and&nbsp;<a NAME="321"></a>desires?&nbsp;<a NAME="322"></a>

<p>Impos
sible.&nbsp;<a NAME="323"></a>
<br>Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State&nbsp;<a NAME="324"></a>to
be the most miserable of States?&nbsp;<a NAME="325"></a>

<p>And I was right, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="326"></a>
<br>Certainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical&nbsp;<a NAME="327"></a>man,
what do you say of him?&nbsp;<a NAME="328"></a>

<p>I say that he is by far the most miserable of all&nbsp;<a NAME="329"></a>men.&nbsp;<a NAME="330"></a>
<br>T
here, I said, I think that you are beginning to go&nbsp;<a NAME="331"></a>wrong.&nbsp;<a NAME="332"></a>
<br>What do you mean?&nbsp;<a NAME="333"></a>
<br>I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of&nbsp;<a NAME="334"></a>misery.&nbsp;<a NAME="335"></a>

<p>Then who is more miserable?&nbsp;<a NAME="336"></a>
<br>One of whom I am about to speak.&nbsp;<a NAME="337"></a>
<br>Who is that?&nbsp;<a NAME="338"></a>
<br>He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private&amp;nb
sp;<a NAME="339"></a>life
has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public&nbsp;<a NAME="340"></a>tyrant.&nbsp;<a NAME="341"></a>

<p>From what has been said, I gather that you are&nbsp;<a NAME="342"></a>right.&nbsp;<a NAME="343"></a>
<br>Yes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more&nbsp;<a NAME="344"></a>certain,
and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this respecting&nbsp;<a NAME="345"></a>good
and evil is the greatest.&nbsp;<a NAME="346"></a>

<p>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="347"></a>
<br>Let me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, throw a&nbsp;<a NAME="348"></a>light
upon this subject.&nbsp;<a NAME="349"></a>

<p>What is your illustration?&nbsp;<a NAME="350"></a>
<br>The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from&nbsp;<a NAME="351"></a>them
you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have&nbsp;<a NAME="352"></a>slaves;
the only difference is that he has more slaves.&nbsp;<a NAME="
353"></a>

<p>Yes, that is the difference.&nbsp;<a NAME="354"></a>
<br>You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from&nbsp;<a NAME="355"></a>their
servants?&nbsp;<a NAME="356"></a>

<p>What should they fear?&nbsp;<a NAME="357"></a>
<br><b>Nothing.</b> But do you observe the reason of&nbsp;<a NAME="358"></a>this?&nbsp;<a NAME="359"></a>
<br>Yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the&nbsp;<a NAME="360"></a>protection
of each individual.&nbsp;<a NAME="361"></a>

<p>Very true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master&nbsp;<a NAME="362"></a>say
of some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,&nbsp;<a NAME="363"></a>carried
off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to&nbsp;<a NAME="364"></a>help
him --will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and&nbsp;<a NAME="365"></a>children
should be put to death by his slaves?&nbsp;<a NAME="366"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.&amp;nbsp;<a NAME="367"></a>
<br>The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of&nbsp;<a NAME="368"></a>his
slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things,&nbsp;<a NAME="369"></a>much
against his will --he will have to cajole his own&nbsp;<a NAME="370"></a>servants.&nbsp;<a NAME="371"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, that will be the only way of saving&nbsp;<a NAME="372"></a>himself.&nbsp;<a NAME="373"></a>
<br>And suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him wi
th&nbsp;<a NAME="374"></a>neighbours
who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and&nbsp;<a NAME="375"></a>who,
if they could catch the offender, would take his&nbsp;<a NAME="376"></a>life?&nbsp;<a NAME="377"></a>

<p>His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere&nbsp;<a NAME="378"></a>surrounded
and watched by enemies.&nbsp;<a NAME="379"></a>

<p>And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be&nbsp;<a NAME="380"></a>bound
--he who being by nature suc
h as we have described, is full of all&nbsp;<a NAME="381"></a>sorts
of fears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone,&nbsp;<a NAME="382"></a>of
all men in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or to see&nbsp;<a NAME="383"></a>the
things which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole&nbsp;<a NAME="384"></a>like
a woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who&nbsp;<a NAME="385"></a>goes
into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.&nbsp;<a NAME="386"></a>

<p>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="387"></a>
<br>And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his&nbsp;<a NAME="388"></a>own
person --the tyrannical man, I mean --whom you just now decided to&nbsp;<a NAME="389"></a>be
the most miserable of all --will not he be yet more miserable when,&nbsp;<a NAME="390"></a>instead
of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a&nbsp;<a NAME="391"></a>public
tyrant? He has to be master of others when he is not ma
ster of himself:&nbsp;<a NAME="392"></a>he
is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life,&nbsp;<a NAME="393"></a>not
in retirement, but fighting and combating with other&nbsp;<a NAME="394"></a>men.&nbsp;<a NAME="395"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, the similitude is most exact.&nbsp;<a NAME="396"></a>
<br>Is not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant lead&nbsp;<a NAME="397"></a>a
worse life than he whose life you determined to be the&nbsp;<a NAME="398"></a>worst?&amp;nbs
p;<a NAME="399"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="400"></a>
<br>He who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave,&nbsp;<a NAME="401"></a>and
is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and to&nbsp;<a NAME="402"></a>be
the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which he is utterly&nbsp;<a NAME="403"></a>unable
to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly poor,&nbsp;<a NAME="404"></a>if
you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his 
life long he&nbsp;<a NAME="405"></a>is
beset with fear and is full of convulsions, and distractions, even as&nbsp;<a NAME="406"></a>the
State which he resembles: and surely the resemblance&nbsp;<a NAME="407"></a>holds?&nbsp;<a NAME="408"></a>

<p>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="409"></a>
<br>Moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power:&nbsp;<a NAME="410"></a>he
becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more unjust,&nbsp;<a NAME="411"></a>more
friendless, mor
e impious, than he was at first; he is the purveyor&nbsp;<a NAME="412"></a>and
cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is that he is&nbsp;<a NAME="413"></a>supremely
miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable as&nbsp;<a NAME="414"></a>himself.&nbsp;<a NAME="415"></a>

<p>No man of any sense will dispute your words.&nbsp;<a NAME="416"></a>
<br>Come then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests&nbsp;<a NAME="417"></a>proclaims
the result, do you also decide wh
o in your opinion is first in&nbsp;<a NAME="418"></a>the
scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others follow:&nbsp;<a NAME="419"></a>there
are five of them in all --they are the royal, timocratical, oligarchical,&nbsp;<a NAME="420"></a>democratical,
tyrannical.&nbsp;<a NAME="421"></a>

<p>The decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses&nbsp;<a NAME="422"></a>coming
on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they enter,&nbsp;<a NAME="423"></a>by


the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.&nbsp;<a NAME="424"></a>

<p>Need we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston&nbsp;<a NAME="425"></a>(the
best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest,&nbsp;<a NAME="426"></a>and
that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself; and&nbsp;<a NAME="427"></a>that
the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and that&nbsp;<a NAME="428"></a>this
is he who being the greatest tyrant of h
imself is also the greatest&nbsp;<a NAME="429"></a>tyrant
of his State?&nbsp;<a NAME="430"></a>

<p>Make the proclamation yourself, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="431"></a>
<br>And shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and&nbsp;<a NAME="432"></a>men'?&nbsp;<a NAME="433"></a>
<br>Let the words be added.&nbsp;<a NAME="434"></a>
<br>Then this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is another, which&nbsp;<a NAME="435"></a>may
also have some weight.&nbsp;<a NAME="436"></a>

<p>What is that?&nbsp;<a NAME="437"></a>
<br>The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that&nbsp;<a NAME="438"></a>the
individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three&nbsp;<a NAME="439"></a>principles,
the division may, I think, furnish a new&nbsp;<a NAME="440"></a>demonstration.&nbsp;<a NAME="441"></a>

<p>Of what nature?&nbsp;<a NAME="442"></a>
<br>It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond;&nbsp;<a NAME="443"></a>also
three desires and governing powers
.&nbsp;<a NAME="444"></a>

<p>How do you mean? he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="445"></a>
<br>There is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,&nbsp;<a NAME="446"></a>another
with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no special&nbsp;<a NAME="447"></a>name,
but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from the extraordinary&nbsp;<a NAME="448"></a>strength
and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other&nbsp;<a NAME="449"></a>sensual
appetites which are the m
ain elements of it; also money-loving,&nbsp;<a NAME="450"></a>because
such desires are generally satisfied by the help of&nbsp;<a NAME="451"></a>money.&nbsp;<a NAME="452"></a>

<p>That is true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="453"></a>
<br>If we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were&nbsp;<a NAME="454"></a>concerned
with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single notion;&nbsp;<a NAME="455"></a>and
might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving&nbsp;<a NAME="456"></a>gain
or money.&nbsp;<a NAME="457"></a>

<p>I agree with you.&nbsp;<a NAME="458"></a>
<br>Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering&nbsp;<a NAME="459"></a>and
getting fame?&nbsp;<a NAME="460"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="461"></a>
<br>Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious --would the term be&nbsp;<a NAME="462"></a>suitable?&nbsp;<a NAME="463"></a>

<p>Extremely suitable.&nbsp;<a NAME="464"></a>
<br>On the other hand, every one sees that the 
principle of knowledge is&nbsp;<a NAME="465"></a>wholly
directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others&nbsp;<a NAME="466"></a>for
gain or fame.&nbsp;<a NAME="467"></a>

<p>Far less.&nbsp;<a NAME="468"></a>
<br>'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly&nbsp;<a NAME="469"></a>apply
to that part of the soul?&nbsp;<a NAME="470"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="471"></a>
<br>One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in&nbsp;<a NAME="4
72"></a>others,
as may happen?&nbsp;<a NAME="473"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="474"></a>
<br>Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men --lovers&nbsp;<a NAME="475"></a>of
wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?&nbsp;<a NAME="476"></a>

<p>Exactly.&nbsp;<a NAME="477"></a>
<br>And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several&nbsp;<a NAME="478"></a>objects?&nbsp;<a NAME="479"></a>

<p>Very true.&nbsp;<a NAME="480"></a>
<br>Now, if you examine the three classes o
f men, and ask of them in turn&nbsp;<a NAME="481"></a>which
of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own&nbsp;<a NAME="482"></a>and
depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the vanity&nbsp;<a NAME="483"></a>of
honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages&nbsp;<a NAME="484"></a>of
gold and silver?&nbsp;<a NAME="485"></a>

<p>True, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="486"></a>
<br>And the lover of honour --what will be his opinion? Will he not think&amp;nbsp;<a NAME="487"></a>that
the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning,&nbsp;<a NAME="488"></a>if
it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to&nbsp;<a NAME="489"></a>him?&nbsp;<a NAME="490"></a>

<p>Very true.&nbsp;<a NAME="491"></a>
<br>And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value&nbsp;<a NAME="492"></a>on
other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth,&nbsp;<a NAME="493"></a>and
in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not s
o far indeed from the&nbsp;<a NAME="494"></a>heaven
of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under&nbsp;<a NAME="495"></a>the
idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not&nbsp;<a NAME="496"></a>have
them?&nbsp;<a NAME="497"></a>

<p>There can be no doubt of that, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="498"></a>
<br>Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in&nbsp;<a NAME="499"></a>dispute,
and the question is not which life is more or less honoura
ble,&nbsp;<a NAME="500"></a>or
better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless --how shall&nbsp;<a NAME="501"></a>we
know who speaks truly?&nbsp;<a NAME="502"></a>

<p>I cannot myself tell, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="503"></a>
<br>Well, but what ought to be the criterion? Is any better than experience&nbsp;<a NAME="504"></a>and
wisdom and reason?&nbsp;<a NAME="505"></a>

<p>There cannot be a better, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="506"></a>
<br>Then, I said, reflect. Of the three individuals, which 
has the greatest&nbsp;<a NAME="507"></a>experience
of all the pleasures which we enumerated? Has the lover of gain,&nbsp;<a NAME="508"></a>in
learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of the pleasure&nbsp;<a NAME="509"></a>of
knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of&nbsp;<a NAME="510"></a>gain?&nbsp;<a NAME="511"></a>

<p>The philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he&nbsp;<a NAME="512"></a>has
of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures fro
m his&nbsp;<a NAME="513"></a>childhood
upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not&nbsp;<a NAME="514"></a>of
necessity tasted --or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could&nbsp;<a NAME="515"></a>hardly
have tasted --the sweetness of learning and knowing&nbsp;<a NAME="516"></a>truth.&nbsp;<a NAME="517"></a>

<p>Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of&nbsp;<a NAME="518"></a>gain,
for he has a double experience?&nbsp;<a NAME="519"></a>

<p>Yes, very gre
at.&nbsp;<a NAME="520"></a>
<br>Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the&nbsp;<a NAME="521"></a>lover
of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?&nbsp;<a NAME="522"></a>

<p>Nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain&nbsp;<a NAME="523"></a>their
object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike&nbsp;<a NAME="524"></a>have
their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have&nbsp;<a NAME="525"></a>experience
of the pleasures 
of honour; but the delight which is to be found&nbsp;<a NAME="526"></a>in
the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher&nbsp;<a NAME="527"></a>only.&nbsp;<a NAME="528"></a>

<p>His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any&nbsp;<a NAME="529"></a>one?&nbsp;<a NAME="530"></a>
<br>Far better.&nbsp;<a NAME="531"></a>
<br>And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as&nbsp;<a NAME="532"></a>experience?&nbsp;<a NAME="533"></a>
<br>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="534"></a>
<br>Further,
 the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not&nbsp;<a NAME="535"></a>possessed
by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the&nbsp;<a NAME="536"></a>philosopher?&nbsp;<a NAME="537"></a>

<p>What faculty?&nbsp;<a NAME="538"></a>
<br>Reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to&nbsp;<a NAME="539"></a>rest.&nbsp;<a NAME="540"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="541"></a>
<br>And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?&nbsp;<a NAME="542"></a>
<br>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="543"></a>
<br>If wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of&nbsp;<a NAME="544"></a>the
lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?&nbsp;<a NAME="545"></a>

<p>Assuredly.&nbsp;<a NAME="546"></a>
<br>Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of the&nbsp;<a NAME="547"></a>ambitious
or pugnacious would be the truest?&nbsp;<a NAME="548"></a>

<p>Clearly.&nbsp;<a NAME="549"></a>
<br>But since experience and wisdom and reason are the&nbsp;<a NAME="550"></a>judges-
-&nbsp;<a NAME="551"></a>
<br>The only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are&nbsp;<a NAME="552"></a>approved
by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.&nbsp;<a NAME="553"></a>

<p>And so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent&nbsp;<a NAME="554"></a>part
of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in&nbsp;<a NAME="555"></a>whom
this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest&nbsp;<a NAME="556"></a>life.&nbsp;<a NAME="557"></a>

<p>Unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when&nbsp;<a NAME="558"></a>he
approves of his own life.&nbsp;<a NAME="559"></a>

<p>And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and&nbsp;<a NAME="560"></a>the
pleasure which is next?&nbsp;<a NAME="561"></a>

<p>Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer&nbsp;<a NAME="562"></a>to
himself than the money-maker.&nbsp;<a NAME="563"></a>

<p>Last comes the lover of gain?&nbsp;<a NAME="564"></a>
<br>Very t
rue, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="565"></a>
<br>Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in&nbsp;<a NAME="566"></a>this
conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to Olympian&nbsp;<a NAME="567"></a>Zeus
the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that&nbsp;<a NAME="568"></a>of
the wise is quite true and pure --all others are a shadow only; and&nbsp;<a NAME="569"></a>surely
this will prove the greatest and most decisive of&nbsp;<a NAME="570"></a>fal
ls?&nbsp;<a NAME="571"></a>

<p>Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?&nbsp;<a NAME="572"></a>
<br>I will work out the subject and you shall answer my&nbsp;<a NAME="573"></a>questions.&nbsp;<a NAME="574"></a>
<br>Proceed.&nbsp;<a NAME="575"></a>
<br>Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?&nbsp;<a NAME="576"></a>
<br>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="577"></a>
<br>And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor&nbsp;<a NAME="578"></a>pain?&nbsp;<a NAME="579"></a>
<br>There is.&nbsp;<a NAM E="580"></a>
<br>A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about&nbsp;<a NAME="581"></a>either
--that is what you mean?&nbsp;<a NAME="582"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="583"></a>
<br>You remember what people say when they are sick?&nbsp;<a NAME="584"></a>
<br>What do they say?&nbsp;<a NAME="585"></a>
<br>That after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they never&nbsp;<a NAME="586"></a>knew
this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were&nbsp;<a NAME="587"></a>ill.
&nbsp;<a NAME="588"></a>

<p>Yes, I know, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="589"></a>
<br>And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must. have heard&nbsp;<a NAME="590"></a>them
say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their&nbsp;<a NAME="591"></a>pain?&nbsp;<a NAME="592"></a>

<p>I have.&nbsp;<a NAME="593"></a>
<br>And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest&nbsp;<a NAME="594"></a>and
cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them&nbsp;<a NAME="595"></a>as
the greatest pleasure?&nbsp;<a NAME="596"></a>

<p>Yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to&nbsp;<a NAME="597"></a>be
at rest.&nbsp;<a NAME="598"></a>

<p>Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will&nbsp;<a NAME="599"></a>be
painful?&nbsp;<a NAME="600"></a>

<p>Doubtless, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="601"></a>
<br>Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also&nbsp;<a NAME="602"></a>be
pain?&nbsp;<a NAME="603"></a>

<p>S
o it would seem.&nbsp;<a NAME="604"></a>
<br>But can that which is neither become both?&nbsp;<a NAME="605"></a>
<br>I should say not.&nbsp;<a NAME="606"></a>
<br>And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they&nbsp;<a NAME="607"></a>not?&nbsp;<a NAME="608"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="609"></a>
<br>But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,&nbsp;<a NAME="610"></a>and
in a mean between them?&nbsp;<a NAME="611"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="612"></a>
<br>How, th
en, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is&nbsp;<a NAME="613"></a>pleasure,
or that the absence of pleasure is pain?&nbsp;<a NAME="614"></a>

<p>Impossible.&nbsp;<a NAME="615"></a>
<br>This then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is tc say,&nbsp;<a NAME="616"></a>the
rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful,&nbsp;<a NAME="617"></a>and
painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these representations,&nbsp;<a NAME="618"></a>when
tried by t
he test of true pleasure, are not real but a sort of&nbsp;<a NAME="619"></a>imposition?&nbsp;<a NAME="620"></a>

<p>That is the inference.&nbsp;<a NAME="621"></a>
<br>Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains&nbsp;<a NAME="622"></a>and
you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that pleasure&nbsp;<a NAME="623"></a>is
only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.&nbsp;<a NAME="624"></a>

<p>What are they, he said, and where shall I find&nbsp;<a NAME="625"></a>them?&nbsp;<a NAME="626"></a>
<br>There are many of them: take as an example the pleasures, of smell,&nbsp;<a NAME="627"></a>which
are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment,&nbsp;<a NAME="628"></a>and
when they depart leave no pain behind them.&nbsp;<a NAME="629"></a>

<p>Most true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="630"></a>
<br>Let us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation&nbsp;<a NAME="631"></a>of
pain, or pain of pleasure.&nbsp;<a NAME="632"></a>


<p>No.&nbsp;<a NAME="633"></a>
<br>Still, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul&nbsp;<a NAME="634"></a>through
the body are generally of this sort --they are reliefs of&nbsp;<a NAME="635"></a>pain.&nbsp;<a NAME="636"></a>

<p>That is true.&nbsp;<a NAME="637"></a>
<br>And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like&nbsp;<a NAME="638"></a>nature?&nbsp;<a NAME="639"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="640"></a>
<br>Shall I give you an illustration of them?&nbsp;<a NAME="641"></a>
<br>Let me hear.&nbsp;<a NAME="642"></a>
<br>You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower&nbsp;<a NAME="643"></a>and
middle region?&nbsp;<a NAME="644"></a>

<p>I should.&nbsp;<a NAME="645"></a>
<br>And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would&nbsp;<a NAME="646"></a>he
not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the middle&nbsp;<a NAME="647"></a>and
sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in the upper&nbsp;<a NAME="648"></a>region,
if he has never seen the true upper world?&nbsp;<a NAME="649"></a>

<p>To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?&nbsp;<a NAME="650"></a>
<br>But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine,&nbsp;<a NAME="651"></a>that
he was descending?&nbsp;<a NAME="652"></a>

<p>No doubt.&nbsp;<a NAME="653"></a>
<br>All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle&nbsp;<a NAME="654"></a>and
lower regions?&nbsp;<a NAME="655"></a>

<p>Yes.&amp;nb
sp;<a NAME="656"></a>
<br>Then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth,&nbsp;<a NAME="657"></a>as
they have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong&nbsp;<a NAME="658"></a>ideas
about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when&nbsp;<a NAME="659"></a>they
are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think&nbsp;<a NAME="660"></a>the
pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when drawn&nbsp;<a NAME="661"></a>away
fr
om pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly believe&nbsp;<a NAME="662"></a>that
they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they, not knowing&nbsp;<a NAME="663"></a>pleasure,
err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain. which is like&nbsp;<a NAME="664"></a>contrasting
black with grey instead of white --can you wonder, I say, at&nbsp;<a NAME="665"></a>this?&nbsp;<a NAME="666"></a>

<p>No, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the&nbsp;<a NAME="667"></a>opposite.&amp;nbsp;<a NAME="668"></a>

<p>Look at the matter thus: --Hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions&nbsp;<a NAME="669"></a>of
the bodily state?&nbsp;<a NAME="670"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="671"></a>
<br>And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?&nbsp;<a NAME="672"></a>
<br>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="673"></a>
<br>And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of&nbsp;<a NAME="674"></a>either?&nbsp;<a NAME="675"></a>
<br>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="676"></a>
<br>And is the satisfaction de
rived from that which has less or from that&nbsp;<a NAME="677"></a>which
has more existence the truer?&nbsp;<a NAME="678"></a>

<p>Clearly, from that which has more.&nbsp;<a NAME="679"></a>
<br>What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your&nbsp;<a NAME="680"></a>judgment
--those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of&nbsp;<a NAME="681"></a>sustenance
are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge&nbsp;<a NAME="682"></a>and
mind and all th
e different kinds of virtue? Put the question in this&nbsp;<a NAME="683"></a>way:
--Which has a more pure being --that which is concerned with the invariable,&nbsp;<a NAME="684"></a>the
immortal, and the true, and is of such a nature, and is found in such&nbsp;<a NAME="685"></a>natures;
or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and&nbsp;<a NAME="686"></a>mortal,
and is itself variable and mortal?&nbsp;<a NAME="687"></a>

<p>Far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned
&nbsp;<a NAME="688"></a>with
the invariable.&nbsp;<a NAME="689"></a>

<p>And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in&nbsp;<a NAME="690"></a>the
same degree as of essence?&nbsp;<a NAME="691"></a>

<p>Yes, of knowledge in the same degree.&nbsp;<a NAME="692"></a>
<br>And of truth in the same degree?&nbsp;<a NAME="693"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="694"></a>
<br>And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of&nbsp;<a NAME="695"></a>essence?&nbsp;<a NAME="696"></a>



<p>Necessarily.&nbsp;<a NAME="697"></a>
<br>Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of&nbsp;<a NAME="698"></a>the
body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service&nbsp;<a NAME="699"></a>of
the soul?&nbsp;<a NAME="700"></a>

<p>Far less.&nbsp;<a NAME="701"></a>
<br>And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the&nbsp;<a NAME="702"></a>soul?&nbsp;<a NAME="703"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="704"></a>
<br>What is filled with more real exist
ence, and actually has a more real&nbsp;<a NAME="705"></a>existence,
is more really filled than that which is filled with less real&nbsp;<a NAME="706"></a>existence
and is less real?&nbsp;<a NAME="707"></a>

<p>Of course.&nbsp;<a NAME="708"></a>
<br>And if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according&nbsp;<a NAME="709"></a>to
nature, that which is more really filled with more real being will more&nbsp;<a NAME="710"></a>really
and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which parti
cipates in&nbsp;<a NAME="711"></a>less
real being will be less truly and surely satisfied, and will participate&nbsp;<a NAME="712"></a>in
an illusory and less real pleasure?&nbsp;<a NAME="713"></a>

<p>Unquestionably.&nbsp;<a NAME="714"></a>
<br>Those then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with&nbsp;<a NAME="715"></a>gluttony
and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and in&nbsp;<a NAME="716"></a>this
region they move at random throughout life, but they never pass int
o&nbsp;<a NAME="717"></a>the
true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever find&nbsp;<a NAME="718"></a>their
way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do they taste&nbsp;<a NAME="719"></a>of
pure and abiding pleasure. Like cattle, with their eyes always looking&nbsp;<a NAME="720"></a>down
and their heads stooping to the earth, that is, to the dining-table,&nbsp;<a NAME="721"></a>they
fatten and feed and breed, and, in their excessive love of these delights,&nbsp;<a NAME="7
22"></a>they
kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of&nbsp;<a NAME="723"></a>iron;
and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust. For&nbsp;<a NAME="724"></a>they
fill themselves with that which is not substantial, and the part of&nbsp;<a NAME="725"></a>themselves
which they fill is also unsubstantial and&nbsp;<a NAME="726"></a>incontinent.&nbsp;<a NAME="727"></a>

<p>Verily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many&nbsp;<a NAME="728"></a>like


an oracle.&nbsp;<a NAME="729"></a>

<p>Their pleasures are mixed with pains --how can they be otherwise?&nbsp;<a NAME="730"></a>For
they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by&nbsp;<a NAME="731"></a>contrast,
which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant in&nbsp;<a NAME="732"></a>the
minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought about&nbsp;<a NAME="733"></a>as
Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at&nbsp;<a NAME="73
4"></a>Troy
in ignorance of the truth.&nbsp;<a NAME="735"></a>

<p>Something of that sort must inevitably happen.&nbsp;<a NAME="736"></a>
<br>And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element&nbsp;<a NAME="737"></a>of
the soul? Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action,&nbsp;<a NAME="738"></a>be
in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or violent and&nbsp;<a NAME="739"></a>contentious,
or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to attain honour&amp;nbsp;<a NAME="740"></a>and
victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or&nbsp;<a NAME="741"></a>sense?&nbsp;<a NAME="742"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element&nbsp;<a NAME="743"></a>also.&nbsp;<a NAME="744"></a>
<br>Then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,&nbsp;<a NAME="745"></a>when
they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of&nbsp;<a NAME="746"></a>reason
and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pl
easures which wisdom&nbsp;<a NAME="747"></a>shows
them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which&nbsp;<a NAME="748"></a>is
attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and they will have&nbsp;<a NAME="749"></a>the
pleasures which are natural to them, if that which is best for each&nbsp;<a NAME="750"></a>one
is also most natural to him?&nbsp;<a NAME="751"></a>

<p>Yes, certainly; the best is the most natural.&nbsp;<a NAME="752"></a>
<br>And when the whole soul follows the 
philosophical principle, and there&nbsp;<a NAME="753"></a>is
no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their own&nbsp;<a NAME="754"></a>business,
and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they&nbsp;<a NAME="755"></a>are
capable?&nbsp;<a NAME="756"></a>

<p>Exactly.&nbsp;<a NAME="757"></a>
<br>But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in attaining&nbsp;<a NAME="758"></a>its
own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which&nbsp;;<a NAME="759"></a>is
a shadow only and which is not their own?&nbsp;<a NAME="760"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="761"></a>
<br>And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and&nbsp;<a NAME="762"></a>reason,
the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?&nbsp;<a NAME="763"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="764"></a>
<br>And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance&nbsp;<a NAME="765"></a>from
law and order?&nbsp;<a NAME="766"></a>

<p>Clearly.&nbsp;<a NA ME="767"></a>
<br>And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest&nbsp;<a NAME="768"></a>distance?
Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="769"></a>

<p>And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?&nbsp;<a NAME="770"></a>
<br>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="771"></a>
<br>Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural&nbsp;<a NAME="772"></a>pleasure,
and the king at the least?&nbsp;<a NAME="773"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="774"></a>
<br>But if so, the tyrant will live most unp
leasantly, and the king most&nbsp;<a NAME="775"></a>pleasantly?&nbsp;<a NAME="776"></a>

<p>Inevitably.&nbsp;<a NAME="777"></a>
<br>Would you know the measure of the interval which separates&nbsp;<a NAME="778"></a>them?&nbsp;<a NAME="779"></a>
<br>Will you tell me?&nbsp;<a NAME="780"></a>
<br>There appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: now&nbsp;<a NAME="781"></a>the
transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he&nbsp;<a NAME="782"></a>has
run away from the r
egion of law and reason, and taken up his abode&nbsp;<a NAME="783"></a>with
certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure&nbsp;<a NAME="784"></a>of
his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.&nbsp;<a NAME="785"></a>

<p>How do you mean?&nbsp;<a NAME="786"></a>
<br>I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch;&nbsp;<a NAME="787"></a>the
democrat was in the middle?&nbsp;<a NAME="788"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="789"></a>
<br>And if there is trut
h in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an&nbsp;<a NAME="790"></a>image
of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure&nbsp;<a NAME="791"></a>of
the oligarch?&nbsp;<a NAME="792"></a>

<p>He will.&nbsp;<a NAME="793"></a>
<br>And the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal&nbsp;<a NAME="794"></a>and
aristocratical?&nbsp;<a NAME="795"></a>

<p>Yes, he is third.&nbsp;<a NAME="796"></a>
<br>Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a numb
er&nbsp;<a NAME="797"></a>which
is three times three?&nbsp;<a NAME="798"></a>

<p>Manifestly.&nbsp;<a NAME="799"></a>
<br>The shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of&nbsp;<a NAME="800"></a>length
will be a plane figure.&nbsp;<a NAME="801"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="802"></a>
<br>And if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no&nbsp;<a NAME="803"></a>difficulty
in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted&nbsp;<a NAME="804"></a>from

the king.&nbsp;<a NAME="805"></a>

<p>Yes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.&nbsp;<a NAME="806"></a>
<br>Or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval&nbsp;<a NAME="807"></a>by
which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he will&nbsp;<a NAME="808"></a>find
him, when the multiplication is complete, living 729 times more pleasantly,&nbsp;<a NAME="809"></a>and
the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.&nbsp;<a NAME="810"></a>

<p>What a wonderful
 calculation! And how enormous is the distance&nbsp;<a NAME="811"></a>which
separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and&nbsp;<a NAME="812"></a>pain!&nbsp;<a NAME="813"></a>

<p>Yet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns&nbsp;<a NAME="814"></a>human
life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months&nbsp;<a NAME="815"></a>and
years.&nbsp;<a NAME="816"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with&nbsp;<a NAME="817"></a>them.&amp;nbs
p;<a NAME="818"></a>
<br>Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil&nbsp;<a NAME="819"></a>and
unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of&nbsp;<a NAME="820"></a>life
and in beauty and virtue?&nbsp;<a NAME="821"></a>

<p>Immeasurably greater.&nbsp;<a NAME="822"></a>
<br>Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument,&nbsp;<a NAME="823"></a>we
may revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one saying&nbsp;<a NAME="82
4"></a>that
injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be&nbsp;<a NAME="825"></a>just?&nbsp;<a NAME="826"></a>

<p>Yes, that was said.&nbsp;<a NAME="827"></a>
<br>Now then, having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice,&nbsp;<a NAME="828"></a>let
us have a little conversation with him.&nbsp;<a NAME="829"></a>

<p>What shall we say to him?&nbsp;<a NAME="830"></a>
<br>Let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words presented&nbsp;<a NAME="831"></a>before
his eyes.&nbsp;<a NAME="832"></a>

<p>Of what sort?&nbsp;<a NAME="833"></a>
<br>An ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient&nbsp;<a NAME="834"></a>mythology,
such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are many&nbsp;<a NAME="835"></a>others
in which two or more different natures are said to grow into&nbsp;<a NAME="836"></a>one.&nbsp;<a NAME="837"></a>

<p>There are said of have been such unions.&nbsp;<a NAME="838"></a>
<br>Then do you now model the form of
 a multitudinous, many-headed monster,&nbsp;<a NAME="839"></a>having
a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he&nbsp;<a NAME="840"></a>is
able to generate and metamorphose at will.&nbsp;<a NAME="841"></a>

<p>You suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is&nbsp;<a NAME="842"></a>more
pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model&nbsp;<a NAME="843"></a>as
you propose.&nbsp;<a NAME="844"></a>

<p>Suppose now that you make a second form as o
f a lion, and a third&nbsp;<a NAME="845"></a>of
a man, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than&nbsp;<a NAME="846"></a>the
second.&nbsp;<a NAME="847"></a>

<p>That, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you&nbsp;<a NAME="848"></a>say.&nbsp;<a NAME="849"></a>
<br>And now join them, and let the three grow into one.&nbsp;<a NAME="850"></a>
<br>That has been accomplished.&nbsp;<a NAME="851"></a>
<br>Next fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man,&nbsp;;<a NAME="852"></a>so
that he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer hull,&nbsp;<a NAME="853"></a>may
believe the beast to be a single human creature. I have done so, he&nbsp;<a NAME="854"></a>said.&nbsp;<a NAME="855"></a>

<p>And now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human&nbsp;<a NAME="856"></a>creature
to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that,&nbsp;<a NAME="857"></a>if
he be right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous&amp;n
bsp;<a NAME="858"></a>monster
and strengthen the lion and the lion-like qualities, but to starve&nbsp;<a NAME="859"></a>and
weaken the man, who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the&nbsp;<a NAME="860"></a>mercy
of either of the other two; and he is not to attempt to familiarize&nbsp;<a NAME="861"></a>or
harmonize them with one another --he ought rather to suffer them to&nbsp;<a NAME="862"></a>fight
and bite and devour one another.&nbsp;<a NAME="863"></a>

<p>Certainly, he said; that is wh
at the approver of injustice&nbsp;<a NAME="864"></a>says.&nbsp;<a NAME="865"></a>
<br>To him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so&nbsp;<a NAME="866"></a>speak
and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most&nbsp;<a NAME="867"></a>complete
mastery over the entire human creature.&nbsp;<a NAME="868"></a>

<p>He should watch over the many-headed monster like a good husbandman,&nbsp;<a NAME="869"></a>fostering
and cultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing 
the wild&nbsp;<a NAME="870"></a>ones
from growing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally, and in&nbsp;<a NAME="871"></a>common
care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another&nbsp;<a NAME="872"></a>and
with himself.&nbsp;<a NAME="873"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice&nbsp;<a NAME="874"></a>say.&nbsp;<a NAME="875"></a>
<br>And so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or advantage,&nbsp;<a NAME="876"></a>the
approver of jus
tice is right and speaks the truth, and the disapprover&nbsp;<a NAME="877"></a>is
wrong and false and ignorant.&nbsp;<a NAME="878"></a>

<p>Yes, from every point of view.&nbsp;<a NAME="879"></a>
<br>Come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally&nbsp;<a NAME="880"></a>in
error. 'Sweet Sir,' we will say to him, what think you of things esteemed&nbsp;<a NAME="881"></a>noble
and ignoble? Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the&nbsp;<a NAME="882"></a>man,
or r
ather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which subjects the&nbsp;<a NAME="883"></a>man
to the beast?' He can hardly avoid saying yes --can he&nbsp;<a NAME="884"></a>now?&nbsp;<a NAME="885"></a>

<p>Not if he has any regard for my opinion.&nbsp;<a NAME="886"></a>
<br>But, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question:&nbsp;<a NAME="887"></a>'Then
how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition&nbsp;<a NAME="888"></a>that
he was to enslave the noblest part of 
him to the worst? Who can imagine&nbsp;<a NAME="889"></a>that
a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money, especially&nbsp;<a NAME="890"></a>if
he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be the gainer,&nbsp;<a NAME="891"></a>however
large might be the sum which he received? And will any one say&nbsp;<a NAME="892"></a>that
he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine&nbsp;<a NAME="893"></a>being
to that which is most godless and detestable? Eriphyle t
ook the necklace&nbsp;<a NAME="894"></a>as
the price of her husband's life, but he is taking a bribe in order to&nbsp;<a NAME="895"></a>compass
a worse ruin.'&nbsp;<a NAME="896"></a>

<p>Yes, said Glaucon, far worse --I will answer for&nbsp;<a NAME="897"></a>him.&nbsp;<a NAME="898"></a>
<br>Has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge&nbsp;<a NAME="899"></a>multiform
monster is allowed to be too much at large?&nbsp;<a NAME="900"></a>

<p>Clearly.&nbsp;<a NAME="901"></a>
<br>And men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent&nbsp;<a NAME="902"></a>element
in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?&nbsp;<a NAME="903"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="904"></a>
<br>And luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this&nbsp;<a NAME="905"></a>same
creature, and make a coward of him?&nbsp;<a NAME="906"></a>

<p>Very true.&nbsp;<a NAME="907"></a>
<br>And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates&nbsp;<a NAME="9
08"></a>the
spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money,&nbsp;<a NAME="909"></a>of
which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his youth&nbsp;<a NAME="910"></a>to
be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a&nbsp;<a NAME="911"></a>monkey?&nbsp;<a NAME="912"></a>

<p>True, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="913"></a>
<br>And why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach Only because&nbsp;<a NAME="914"></a>they
imply a natural weakness of the higher princ
iple; the individual is&nbsp;<a NAME="915"></a>unable
to control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and&nbsp;<a NAME="916"></a>his
great study is how to flatter them.&nbsp;<a NAME="917"></a>

<p>Such appears to be the reason.&nbsp;<a NAME="918"></a>
<br>And therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that&nbsp;<a NAME="919"></a>of
the best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in whom&nbsp;<a NAME="920"></a>the
Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, t
o the injury of the servant,&nbsp;<a NAME="921"></a>but
because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within&nbsp;<a NAME="922"></a>him;
or, if this be impossible, then by an external authority, in order&nbsp;<a NAME="923"></a>that
we may be all, as far as possible, under the same government, friends&nbsp;<a NAME="924"></a>and
equals.&nbsp;<a NAME="925"></a>

<p>True, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="926"></a>
<br>And this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is the&nbsp;<a N AME="927"></a>ally
of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we exercise&nbsp;<a NAME="928"></a>over
children, and the refusal to let them be free until we have established&nbsp;<a NAME="929"></a>in
them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state, and by cultivation&nbsp;<a NAME="930"></a>of
this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler&nbsp;<a NAME="931"></a>like
our own, and when this is done they may go their&nbsp;<a NAME="932"></a>ways.&nbsp;<a NAME="933"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.&nbsp;<a NAME="934"></a>
<br>From what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a&nbsp;<a NAME="935"></a>man
is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will&nbsp;<a NAME="936"></a>make
him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his&nbsp;<a NAME="937"></a>wickedness?&nbsp;<a NAME="938"></a>

<p>From no point of view at all.&nbsp;<a NAME="939"></a>
<br>What shall he profit, if his inju
stice be undetected and unpunished?&nbsp;<a NAME="940"></a>He
who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and punished&nbsp;<a NAME="941"></a>has
the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the gentler element&nbsp;<a NAME="942"></a>in
him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the&nbsp;<a NAME="943"></a>acquirement
of justice and temperance and wisdom, more than the body ever&nbsp;<a NAME="944"></a>is
by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and health,
 in proportion as&nbsp;<a NAME="945"></a>the
soul is more honourable than the body.&nbsp;<a NAME="946"></a>

<p>Certainly, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="947"></a>
<br>To this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies&nbsp;<a NAME="948"></a>of
his life. And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress&nbsp;<a NAME="949"></a>these
qualities on his soul and disregard others?&nbsp;<a NAME="950"></a>

<p>Clearly, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="951"></a>
<br>In the next place, he will
 regulate his bodily habit and training,&nbsp;<a NAME="952"></a>and
so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures,&nbsp;<a NAME="953"></a>that
he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first&nbsp;<a NAME="954"></a>object
will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is&nbsp;<a NAME="955"></a>likely
thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to attemper&nbsp;<a NAME="956"></a>the
body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?&nbsp;<a NAME="957"></a>

<p>Certainly he will, if he has true music in him.&nbsp;<a NAME="958"></a>
<br>And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and&nbsp;<a NAME="959"></a>harmony
which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled&nbsp;<a NAME="960"></a>by
the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite&nbsp;<a NAME="961"></a>harm?&nbsp;<a NAME="962"></a>

<p>Certainly not, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="963"></a>
<br>He will look at the city which is wit
hin him, and take heed that no&nbsp;<a NAME="964"></a>disorder
occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or from&nbsp;<a NAME="965"></a>want;
and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or&nbsp;<a NAME="966"></a>spend
according to his means.&nbsp;<a NAME="967"></a>

<p>Very true.&nbsp;<a NAME="968"></a>
<br>And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours&nbsp;<a NAME="969"></a>as
he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether priv
ate&nbsp;<a NAME="970"></a>or
public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will&nbsp;<a NAME="971"></a>avoid?&nbsp;<a NAME="972"></a>

<p>Then, if that is his motive, he will not be a&nbsp;<a NAME="973"></a>statesman.&nbsp;<a NAME="974"></a>
<br>By the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which 's his own he certainly&nbsp;<a NAME="975"></a>will,
though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a divine&nbsp;<a NAME="976"></a>call.&nbsp;<a NAME="977"></a>

<p>I understand; you mean that
 he will be a ruler in the city of which&nbsp;<a NAME="978"></a>we
are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe&nbsp;<a NAME="979"></a>that
there is such an one anywhere on earth?&nbsp;<a NAME="980"></a>

<p>In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks,&nbsp;<a NAME="981"></a>which
he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in&nbsp;<a NAME="982"></a>order.
But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no&nbsp;<a NAME="9
83"></a>matter;
for he will live after the manner of that city, having nothing&nbsp;<a NAME="984"></a>to
do with any other.&nbsp;<a NAME="985"></a>

<p>I think so, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="end"></a>
