			<font size="5" color="#800000" face="Arial Black">&quot;In the Eucharist 
			Christ wanted to give us <i>his </i>love, which impelled him to 
			offer his life for us on the Cross. </font></span></p>
			<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
			<font size="5" color="#800000" face="Arial Black">At the Last 
			Supper, in washing the disciples' feet, Jesus left us the 
			commandment of love: 'even as I have loved you, that you also love 
			one another' (Jn 13:34). </font></span></p>
			<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
			<font size="5" color="#800000" face="Arial Black">However, since 
			this is only possible by remaining united to him like branches to 
			the vine (cf. Jn 15:1-8), he chose to remain with us himself in the 
			Eucharist so that we could <i>remain</i> <i>in him. </i></font>
			</span></p>
			<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
			<font size="5" color="#800000" face="Arial Black">When, therefore, 
			we nourish ourselves with faith on his Body and Blood, his love 
			passes into us and makes us capable in turn of laying down our lives 
			for our brethren (cf. 1 Jn 3:16) </font></span></p>
			<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
			<font size="5" color="#800000" face="Arial Black">. . . . From this 
			flows Christian joy, the joy of love and the joy to be loved.&quot;&nbsp;
