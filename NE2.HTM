<p><b>BOOK II</b>

<p>&nbsp;1&nbsp; <b>Excellence, then, being of two kinds, intellectual
and moral,</b> intellectual excellence in the main owes both its birth
and its growth to teaching (for which reason it requires experience and
time), while moral excellence comes about as a result of habit, whence
also its name is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word
for 'habit'. From this it is also plain that none of the moral excellences
arises in us by nature; for nothing that exists by nature can form a habit
contrary to its nature. For instance the stone which by nature moves downwards
cannot be habituated to move upwards, not even if one tries to train it
by throwing it up ten thousand times; nor can fire be habituated to move
downwards, nor can anything else that by nature behaves in one way be trained
to behave in another. Neither by nature, then, nor contrary to nature do
excellences arise in us; rather we are adapted by nature to receive them,
and are made perfect by habit.

<p>&nbsp;Again, <b>of all the things that come to us by nature we first
acquire the potentiality and later exhibit the activity </b>(this is plain
in the case of the senses; for it was not by often seeing or often hearing
that we got these senses, but on the contrary we had them before we used
them, and did not come to have them by using them); but excellences we
get by first exercising them, as also happens in the case of the arts as
well. For the things we have to learn before we can do, we learn by doing,
e.g. men become builders by building and lyre-players by playing the lyre;
so too we become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate
acts, brave by doing brave acts.

<p>&nbsp;This is confirmed by what happens in states; for legislators make
the citizens good by forming habits in them, and this is the wish of every
legislator; and those who do not effect it miss their mark, and it is in
this that a good constitution differs from a bad one.

<p>&nbsp;Again, it is from the same causes and by the same means that every
excellence is both produced and destroyed, and similarly every art; for
it is from playing the lyre that both good and bad lyre-players are produced.
And the corresponding statement is true of builders and of all the rest;
men will be good or bad builders as a result of building well or badly.
For if this were not so, there would have been no need of a teacher, but
all men would have been born good or bad at their craft. This, then, is
the case with the excellences also; by doing the acts that we do in our
transactions with other men we become just or unjust, and by doing the
acts that we do in the presence of danger, and being habituated to feel
fear or confidence, we become brave or cowardly. The same is true of appetites
and feelings of anger; some men become temperate and good-tempered, others
self-indulgent and irascible, by behaving in one way or the other in the
appropriate circumstances. Thus, in one word, states arise out of like
activities. This is why the activities we exhibit must be of a certain
kind; it is because the states correspond to the differences between these.
It makes no small difference, then, whether we form habits of one kind
or of another from our very youth; it makes a very great difference, or
rather all the difference.

<p>&nbsp;2&nbsp; <b>Since, then, the present inquiry does not aim at theoretical
knowledge like the others (for we are inquiring not in order to know what
excellence is, but in order to become good, since otherwise our inquiry
would have been of no use), we must examine the nature of actions, namely
how we ought to do them; for these determine also the nature of the states
that are produced, as we have said</b>. Now, that we must act according
to right reason is a common principle and must be assumed--it will be discussed
later, i.e. both what it is, and how it is related to the other excellences.
But this must be agreed upon beforehand, that the whole account of matters
of conduct must be given in outline and not precisely, as we said at the
very beginning that the accounts we demand must be in accordance with the
subject-matter; matters concerned with conduct and questions of what is
good for us have no fixity, any more than matters of health. The general
account being of this nature, the account of particular cases is yet more
lacking in exactness; for they do not fall under any art or set of precepts,
but the agents themselves must in each case consider what is appropriate
to the occasion, as happens also in the art of medicine or of navigation.

<p>&nbsp;But though our present account is of this nature we must give
what help we can. First, then, let us consider this, that <i>it is the
nature of such things to be destroyed by defect and excess</i>, as we see
in the case of strength and of health (for to gain light on things imperceptible
we must use the evidence of sensible things); both excessive and defective
exercise destroys the strength, and similarly drink or food which is above
or below a certain amount destroys the health, while that which is proportionate
both produces and increases and preserves it. So too is it, then, in the
case of temperance and courage and the other excellences. For the man who
flies from and fears everything and does not stand his ground against anything
becomes a coward, and the man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet
every danger becomes rash; and similarly the man who indulges in every
pleasure and abstains from none becomes self-indulgent, while the man who
shuns every pleasure, as boors do, becomes in a way insensible; temperance
and courage, then, are destroyed by excess and defect, and preserved by
the mean.

<p>&nbsp;But not only are the sources and causes of their origination and
growth the same as those of their destruction, but also the sphere of their
activity will be the same; for this is also true of the things which are
more evident to sense, e.g. of strength; it is produced by taking much
food and undergoing much exertion, and it is the strong man that will be
most able to do these things. So too is it with the excellences; <i>by
abstaining from pleasures we become temperate,</i> and it is when we have
become so that we are most able to abstain from them; and similarly too
in the case of courage; for by being habituated to despise things that
are terrible and to stand our ground against them we become brave, and
it is when we have become so that we shall be most able to stand our ground
against them.

<p>&nbsp;3&nbsp; We must take as a sign of states the pleasure or pain
that supervenes on acts; for the man who abstains from bodily pleasures
and delights in this very fact is <b>temperate,</b> while the man who is
annoyed at it is self-indulgent, and he who stands his ground against things
that are terrible and delights in this or at least is not pained is<b>
brave</b>, while the man who is pained is a coward. For <i>moral excellence
is concerned with pleasures and pains;</i> it is on account of pleasure
that we do bad things, and on account of pain that we abstain from noble
ones. Hence we ought to have been brought up in a particular way from our
very youth, as Plato says, so as both to delight in and to be pained by
the things that we ought; for this is the right education.

<p>&nbsp;Again, if the excellences are concerned with actions and passions,
and every passion and every action is accompanied by pleasure and pain,
for this reason also excellence will be concerned with pleasures and pains.
This is indicated also by the fact that punishment is inflicted by these
means; for it is a kind of cure, and it is the nature of cures to be effected
by contraries.

<p>&nbsp;Again, as we said but lately, every state of soul has a nature
relative to and concerned with the kind of things by which it tends to
be made worse or better; <i>but it is by reason of pleasures and pains
that men become bad, by pursuing and avoiding these--either the pleasures
and pains they ought not or when they ought not or as they ought not, or
by going wrong in one of the other similar ways that reason can distinguish.</i>
Hence men even define the excellences as certain states of impassivity
and rest; not well, however, because they speak absolutely, and do not
say 'as one ought' and 'as one ought not' and 'when one ought or ought
not', and the other things that may be added. We assume, then, that this
kind of excellence tends to do what is best with regard to pleasures and
pains, and badness does the contrary.

<p>&nbsp;The following facts also may show us that they are concerned with
these same things. <b>There being three objects of choice and three of
avoidance, the noble, the advantageous, the pleasant, and their contraries,
the base, the injurious, the painful,</b> about all of these the good man
tends to go right and the bad man to go wrong, and especially about pleasure;
for this is common to the animals, and also it accompanies all objects
of choice; for even the noble and the advantageous appear pleasant.

<p>&nbsp;Again, it has grown up with us all from our infancy; this is why
it is difficult to rub off this passion, engrained as it is in our life.
And we measure even our actions, some of us more and others less, by pleasure
and pain. For this reason, then, our whole inquiry must be about these;
for to feel delight and pain rightly or wrongly has no small effect on
our actions.

<p>&nbsp;Again, it is harder to fight with pleasure than with anger, to
use Heraclitus' phrase, but both art and excellence are always concerned
with what is harder; for even the good is better when it is harder. Therefore
for this reason also the whole concern both of excellence and of political
science is with pleasures and pains; for the man who uses these well will
be good, he who uses them badly bad.

<p>&nbsp;That excellence, then, is concerned with pleasures and pains,
and that by the acts from which it arises it is both increased and, if
they are done differently, destroyed, and that the acts from which it arose
are those in which it actualizes itself--let this be taken as said.

<p>&nbsp;4&nbsp; The question might be asked, what we mean by saying that
we must become just by doing just acts, and temperate by doing temperate
acts; for if men do just and temperate acts, they are already just and
temperate, exactly as, if they do what is grammatical or musical they are
proficient in grammar and music.

<p>&nbsp;Or is this not true even of the arts? It is possible to do something
grammatical either by chance or under the guidance of another. A man will
be proficient in grammar, then, only when he has both done something grammatical
and done it grammatically; and this means doing it in accordance with the
grammatical knowledge in himself.

<p>&nbsp;Again, the case of the arts and that of the excellences are not
similar; for the products of the arts have their goodness in themselves,
so that it is enough that they should have a certain character, but if
the acts that are in accordance with the excellences have themselves a
certain character it does not follow that they are done justly or temperately.
The agent also must be in a certain condition when he does them; in the
first place he must have knowledge, secondly he must choose the acts, and
choose them for their own sakes, and thirdly his action must proceed from
a firm and unchangeable character. These are not reckoned in as conditions
of the possession of the arts, except the bare knowledge; but as a condition
of the possession of the excellences, knowledge has little or no weight,
while the other conditions count not for a little but for everything, i.e.
the very conditions which result from often doing just and temperate acts.

<p>&nbsp;Actions, then, are called just and temperate when they are such
as the just or the temperate man would do; but it is not the man who does
these that is just and temperate, but the man who also does them as just
and temperate men do them. It is well said, then, that it is by doing just
acts that the just man is produced, and by doing temperate acts the temperate
man; without doing these no one would have even a prospect of becoming
good.

<p>&nbsp;But most people do not do these, but take refuge in theory and
think they are being philosophers and will become good in this way, behaving
somewhat like patients who listen attentively to their doctors, but do
none of the things they are ordered to do. As the latter will not be made
well in body by such a course of treatment, the former will not be made
well in soul by such a course of philosophy.

<p>&nbsp;5&nbsp; <i>Next we must consider what excellence is</i>. Since
things that are found in the soul are of three kinds--passions, faculties,
states--excellence must be one of these. By passions I mean appetite, anger,
fear, confidence, envy, joy, love, hatred, longing, emulation, pity, and
in general the feelings that are accompanied by pleasure or pain; by faculties
the things in virtue of which we are said to be capable of feeling these,
e.g. of becoming angry or being pained or feeling pity; by states the things
in virtue of which we stand well or badly with reference to the passions,
e.g. with reference to anger we stand badly if we feel it violently or
too weakly, and well if we feel it moderately; and similarly with reference
to the other passions.

<p>&nbsp;Now neither the excellences nor the vices are passions, because
we are not called good or bad on the ground of our passions, but are so
called on the ground of our excellences and our vices, and because we are
neither praised nor blamed for our passions (for the man who feels fear
or anger is not praised, nor is the man who simply feels anger blamed,
but the man who feels it in a certain way), but for our excellences and
our vices we are praised or blamed.

<p>&nbsp;Again, we feel anger and fear without choice, but the excellences
are choices or involve choice. Further, in respect of the passions we are
said to be moved, but in respect of the excellences and the vices we are
said not to be moved but to be disposed in a particular way.

<p>&nbsp;For these reasons also they are not faculties; for we are neither
called good nor bad, nor praised nor blamed, for the simple capacity of
feeling the passions; again, we have the faculties by nature, but we are
not made good or bad by nature; we have spoken of this before.

<p><b>&nbsp;If, then, the excellences are neither passions nor faculties,
all that remains is that they should be states.</b>

<p>&nbsp;Thus we have stated what excellence is in respect of its genus.

<p>&nbsp;6&nbsp; We must, however, not only describe it as a state, but
also say what sort of state it is. We may remark, then, that every excellence
both brings into good condition the thing of which it is the excellence
and makes the work of that thing be done well; e.g. the excellence of the
eye makes both the eye and its work good; for it is by the excellence of
the eye that we see well. Similarly the excellence of the horse makes a
horse both good in itself and good at running and at carrying its rider
and at awaiting the attack of the enemy. Therefore, if this is true in
every case, <b>the excellence of man also will be the state which makes
a man good and which makes him do his own work well.</b>

<p>&nbsp;How this is to happen we have stated already, but it will be made
plain also by the following consideration of the nature of excellence.
In everything that is continuous and divisible it is possible to take more,
less, or an equal amount, and that either in terms of the thing itself
or relatively to us; and the equal is an intermediate between excess and
defect. By the intermediate in the object I mean that which is equidistant
from each of the extremes, which is one and the same for all men; by the
intermediate relatively to us that which is neither too much nor too little--and
this is not one, nor the same for all. For instance, if ten is many and
two is few, six is intermediate, taken in terms of the object; for it exceeds
and is exceeded by an equal amount; this is intermediate according to arithmetical
proportion. But the intermediate relatively to us is not to be taken so;
if ten pounds are too much for a particular person to eat and two too little,
it does not follow that the trainer will order six pounds; for this also
is perhaps too much for the person who is to take it, or too little--too
little for Milo, too much for the beginner in athletic exercises. The same
is true of running and wrestling. <b>Thus a master of any art avoids excess
and defect, but seeks the intermediate and chooses this--the intermediate
not in the object but relatively to us.</b>

<p>&nbsp;If it is thus, then, that every art does its work well--by looking
to the intermediate and judging its works by this standard (so that we
often say of good works of the art that it is not possible either to take
away or to add anything, implying that excess and defect destroy the goodness
of works of art, while the mean preserves it; and good artists, as we say,
look to this in their work), and if, further, excellence is more exact
and better than any art, as nature also is, then it must have the quality
of aiming at the intermediate. I mean moral excellence; for it is this
that is concerned with passions and actions, and in these there is excess,
defect, and the intermediate. For instance, both fear and confidence and
appetite and anger and pity and in general pleasure and pain may be felt
both too much and too little, and in both cases not well; but to feel them
at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right
people, with the right aim, and in the right way, is what is both intermediate
and best, and this is characteristic of excellence. Similarly with regard
to actions also there is excess, defect, and the intermediate. Now excellence
is concerned with passions and actions, in which excess is a form of failure,
and so is defect, while the intermediate is praised and is a form of success;
and both these things are characteristics of excellence. Therefore <b>excellence
is a kind of mean, since it aims at what is intermediate.</b>

<p>&nbsp;Again, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to
the class of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to
that of the limited), <b>while to succeed is possible only in one way </b>(for
which reason one is easy and the other difficult--to miss the mark easy,
to hit it difficult); for these reasons also, then, excess and defect are
characteristic of vice, and the mean of excellence;

<p>&nbsp;For men are good in but one way, but bad in many.

<p>&nbsp;<b>Excellence, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in
a mean relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in
which the man of practical wisdom would determine it.</b> Now it is a mean
between two vices, that which depends on excess and that which depends
on defect; and again it is a mean because the vices respectively fall short
of or exceed what is right in both passions and actions, while excellence
both finds and chooses that which is intermediate. Hence in respect of
its substance and the account which states its essence is a mean, with
regard to what is best and right it is an extreme.

<p>&nbsp;<i>But not every action nor every passion admits of a mean;</i>
for some have names that already imply badness, e.g. spite, shamelessness,
envy, and in the case of actions adultery, theft, murder; for all of these
and suchlike things imply by their names that they are themselves bad,
and not the excesses or deficiencies of them. It is not possible, then,
ever to be right with regard to them; <i>one must always be wrong</i>.
Nor does goodness or badness with regard to such things depend on committing
adultery with the right woman, at the right time, and in the right way,
but simply to do any of them is to go wrong. It would be equally absurd,
then, to expect that in unjust, cowardly, and self-indulgent action there
should be a mean, an excess, and a deficiency; for at that rate there would
be a mean of excess and of deficiency, an excess of excess, and a deficiency
of deficiency. But as there is no excess and deficiency of temperance and
courage because what is intermediate is in a sense an extreme, so too of
the actions we have mentioned there is no mean nor any excess and deficiency,
but however they are done they are wrong; for in general there is neither
a mean of excess and deficiency, nor excess and deficiency of a mean.

<p>&nbsp;7&nbsp; We must, however, not only make this general statement,
but also apply it to the individual facts. For among statements about conduct
those which are general apply more widely, but those which are particular
are more true, since conduct has to do with individual cases, and our statements
must harmonize with the facts in these cases. We may take these cases from
the diagram. With regard to feelings of fear and confidence <b>courage
is the mean;</b> of the people who exceed, he who exceeds in fearlessness
has no name (many of the states have no name), while the man who exceeds
in confidence is rash, and he who exceeds in fear and falls short in confidence
is a coward. With regard to pleasures and pains--not all of them, and not
so much with regard to the pains--<b>the mean is temperance,</b> the excess
self-indulgence. Persons deficient with regard to the pleasures are not
often found; hence such persons also have received no name. But let us
call them 'insensible'.

<p>&nbsp;With regard to giving and taking of money <b>the mean is liberality,</b>
the excess and the defect prodigality and meanness. They exceed and fall
short in contrary ways to one another:^11 the prodigal exceeds in spending
and falls short in taking, while the mean man exceeds in taking and falls
short in spending. (At present we are giving a mere outline or summary,
and are satisfied with this; later these states will be more exactly determined.)
With regard to money there are also other dispositions--<b>a mean, magnificence</b>
(for the magnificent man differs from the liberal man; the former deals
with large sums, the latter with small ones), an excess, tastelessness
and vulgarity, and a deficiency, niggardliness; these differ from the states
opposed to liberality, and the mode of their difference will be stated
later.

<p>&nbsp;With regard to honour and dishonour <b>the mean is proper pride</b>,
the excess is known as a sort of empty vanity, and the deficiency is undue
humility; and as we said liberality was related to magnificence, differing
from it by dealing with small sums, so there is a state similarly related
to proper pride, being concerned with small honours while that is concerned
with great. For it is possible to desire small honours^12 as one ought,
and more than one ought, and less, and the man who exceeds in his desires
is called ambitious, the man who falls short unambitious, while the intermediate
person has no name. The dispositions also are nameless, except that that
of the ambitious man is called ambition. Hence the people who are at the
extremes lay claim to the middle place; and we ourselves sometimes call
the intermediate person ambitious and sometimes unambitious, and sometimes
praise the ambitious man and sometimes the unambitious. The reason of our
doing this will be stated in what follows; but now let us speak of the
remaining states according to the method which has been indicated.

<p>&nbsp;With regard to anger also there is an excess, a deficiency, and
a mean. Although they can scarcely be said to have names, yet since we
call the<b> intermediate person good-tempered</b> let us call the mean
good temper; of the persons at the extremes let the one who exceeds be
called irascible, and his vice irascibility, and the man who falls short
an inirascible sort of person, and the deficiency inirascibility.

<p>&nbsp;There are also three other means, which have a certain likeness
to one another, but differ from one another: for they are all concerned
with intercourse in words and actions, but differ in that one is concerned
with truth in this sphere, the other two with pleasantness; and of this
one kind is exhibited in giving amusement, the other in all the circumstances
of life. We must therefore speak of these too, that we may the better see
that in all things the mean is praiseworthy, and<i> the extremes neither
praiseworthy nor right, but worthy of blame.</i> Now most of these states
also have no names, but we must try, as in the other cases, to invent names
ourselves so that we may be clear and easy to follow. With regard to truth,
then, the intermediate is a truthful sort of person and the mean may be
called <b>truthfulness</b>, while the pretence which exaggerates is boastfulness
and the person characterized by it a boaster, and that which understates
is mock modesty and the person characterized by it mock-modest. With regard
to pleasantness in the giving of amusement the intermediate person is<b>
ready-witted</b> and the disposition ready wit, the excess is buffoonery
and the person characterized by it a buffoon, while the man who falls short
is a sort of boor and his state is boorishness. With regard to the remaining
kind of pleasantness, that which is exhibited in life in general, the man
who is pleasant in the right way is <b>friendly</b> and the mean is friendliness,
while the man who exceeds is an obsequious person if he has no end in view,
a flatterer if he is aiming at his own advantage, and the man who falls
short and is unpleasant in all circumstances is a quarrelsome and surly
sort of person.

<p>&nbsp;There are also means in the passions and concerned with the passions;
since shame is not an excellence, and yet praise is extended to the modest
man. For even in these matters one man is said to be intermediate, and
another to exceed, as for instance the bashful man who is ashamed of everything;
while he who falls short or is not ashamed of anything at all is shameless,
and the intermediate person is <b>modest</b>.<b> Righteous indignation
</b>is a mean between envy and spite, and these states are concerned with
the pain and pleasure that are felt at the fortunes of our neighbours;
the man who is characterized by righteous indignation is pained at undeserved
good fortune, the envious man, going beyond him, is pained at all good
fortune, and the spiteful man falls so far short of being pained that he
even rejoices. But these states there will be an opportunity of describing
elsewhere; with regard to justice, since it has not one simple meaning,
we shall, after describing the other states, distinguish its two kinds
and say how each of them is a mean; and similarly we shall treat also of
the rational excellences.

<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">&nbsp;BOOK III</font></b>

<p>&nbsp;1&nbsp; Since excellence is concerned with passions and actions,
and on voluntary passions and actions praise and blame are bestowed, on
those that are involuntary forgiveness, and sometimes also pity, to distinguish
the voluntary and the involuntary is presumably necessary for those who
are studying excellence and useful also for legislators with a view to
the assigning both of honours and of punishments.

<p>&nbsp;Those things, then, are thought involuntary, which take place
under compulsion or owing to ignorance; and that is compulsory of which
the moving principle is outside, being a principle in which nothing is
contributed by the person who acts or is acted upon, e.g. if he were to
be carried somewhere by a wind, or by men who had him in their power.

<p>&nbsp;But with regard to the things that are done from fear of greater
evils or for some noble object (<i>e.g. if a tyrant were to order one to
do something base, having one's parents and children in his power, and
if one did the action they were to be saved, but otherwise would be put
to death)</i>, it may be debated whether such actions are involuntary or
voluntary. Something of the sort happens also with regard to the throwing
of goods overboard in a storm; for in the abstract no one throws goods
away voluntarily, but on condition of its securing the safety of himself
and his crew any sensible man does so. Such actions, then, are mixed, but
are more like voluntary actions; for they are worthy of choice at the time
when they are done, and the end of an action is relative to the occasion.
Both the terms, then, 'voluntary' and 'involuntary', must be used with
reference to the moment of action. Now the man acts voluntarily; for the
principle that moves the instrumental parts of the body in such actions
is in him, and the things of which the moving principle is in a man himself
are in his power to do or not to do. Such actions, therefore, are voluntary,
but in the abstract perhaps involuntary; for no one would choose any such
act in itself.

<p>&nbsp;For such actions men are sometimes even praised, when they endure
something base or painful in return for great and noble objects gained;
in the opposite case they are blamed, since to endure the greatest indignities
for no noble end or for a trifling end is the mark of an inferior person.
On some actions praise indeed is not bestowed, but forgiveness is, when
one does what he ought not under pressure which overstrains human nature
and which no one could withstand. But some acts, perhaps, we cannot be
forced to do, but ought rather to face death after the most fearful sufferings;
for the things that forced Euripides' Alcmaeon to slay his mother seem
absurd. It is difficult sometimes to determine what should be chosen at
what cost, and what should be endured in return for what gain, and yet
more difficult to abide by our decisions; for as a rule what is expected
is painful, and what we are forced to do is base, whence praise and blame
are bestowed on those who have been compelled or have not.<b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;What sort of acts, then, should be called compulsory?</b> We
answer that without qualification actions are so when the cause is in the
external circumstances and the agent contributes nothing. But the things
that in themselves are involuntary, but now and in return for these gains
are worthy of choice, and whose moving principle is in the agent, are in
themselves involuntary, but now and in return for these gains voluntary.
They are more like voluntary acts; for actions are in the class of particulars,
and the particular acts here are voluntary. What sort of things are to
be chosen in return for what it is not easy to state; for there are many
differences in the particular cases.

<p>&nbsp;<i>But if some one were to say that pleasant and noble objects
have a compelling power</i>, forcing us from without, all acts would be
for him compulsory; for it is for these objects that all men do everything
they do. And those who act under compulsion and unwillingly act with pain,
but those who do acts for their pleasantness and nobility do them with
pleasure; it is absurd to make external circumstances responsible, and
not oneself, as being easily caught by such attractions, and to make oneself
responsible for noble acts but the pleasant objects responsible for base
acts. The compulsory, then, seems to be that whose moving principle is
outside, the person compelled contributing nothing.

<p>&nbsp;<i>Everything that is done by reason of ignorance is non-voluntary;</i>
it is only what produces pain and regret that is involuntary. For the man
who has done something owing to ignorance, and feels not the least vexation
at his action, has not acted voluntarily, since he did not know what he
was doing, nor yet involuntarily, since he is not pained. Of people, then,
who act by reason of ignorance he who regrets is thought an involuntary
agent, and the man who does not regret may, since he is different, be called
a non-voluntary agent; for, since he differs from the other, it is better
that he should have a name of his own.

<p>&nbsp;Acting by reason of ignorance seems also to be different from
acting in ignorance; for the man who is drunk or in a rage is thought to
act as a result not of ignorance but of one of the causes mentioned, yet
not knowingly but in ignorance.

<p>&nbsp;<b>Now every wicked man is ignorant of what he ought to do and
what he ought to abstain from, and error of this kind makes men unjust
and in general bad; but the term 'involuntary' tends to be used not if
a man is ignorant of what is to his advantage--for it is not ignorance
in choice that makes action involuntary (it makes men wicked), nor ignorance
of the universal (for that men are blamed), but ignorance of particular
circumstances of the action and the objects with which it is concerned.
For it is on these that both pity and forgiveness depend, since the person
who is ignorant of any of these acts involuntarily.</b>

<p>&nbsp;Perhaps it is just as well, therefore, to determine their nature
and number.<b> A man may be ignorant, then, of who he is, what he is doing,
what or whom he is acting on, and sometimes also what (e.g. what instrument)
he is doing it with, and to what end (e.g. for safety), and how he is doing
it (e.g. whether gently or violently).</b> Now of all of these no one could
be ignorant unless he were mad, and evidently also he could not be ignorant
of the agent; for how could he not know himself? But of what he is doing
a man might be ignorant, as for instance people say 'it slipped out of
their mouths as they were speaking', or 'they did not know it was a secret',
as Aeschylus said of the mysteries, or a man might say he 'let it go off
when he merely wanted to show its working', as the man did with the catapult.
Again, one might think one's son was an enemy, as Merope did, or that a
pointed spear had a button on it, or that a stone was pumice-stone; or
one might give a man a draught to save him, and really kill him; or one
might want to touch a man, as people do in sparring, and really strike
him. The ignorance may relate, then, to any of these things, i.e. of the
circumstances of the action, and the man who was ignorant of any of these
is thought to have acted involuntarily, and especially if he was ignorant
on the most important points; and these are thought to be what he is doing
and with what aim. Further, the doing of an act that is called involuntary
in virtue of ignorance of this sort must be painful and involve regret.

<p>&nbsp;Since that which is done under compulsion or by reason of ignorance
is involuntary, <b>the voluntary would seem to be that of which the moving
principle is in the agent himself, he being aware of the particular circumstances
of the action.</b> <i>Presumably acts done by reason of anger or appetite
are not rightly called involuntary. </i>For in the first place, on that
showing none of the other animals will act voluntarily, nor will children;
and secondly, is it meant that we do not do voluntarily any of the acts
that are due to appetite or anger, or that we do the noble acts voluntarily
and the base acts involuntarily? Is not this absurd, when one and the same
thing is the cause? But it would surely be odd to describe as involuntary
the things one ought to desire; and we ought both to be angry at certain
things and to have an appetite for certain things, e.g. for health and
for learning. Also what is involuntary is thought to be painful, but what
is in accordance with appetite is thought to be pleasant. Again, what is
the difference in respect of involuntariness between errors committed upon
calculation and those committed in anger? Both are to be avoided, but the
irrational passions are thought not less human than reason is, and therefore
also the actions which proceed from anger or appetite are the man's actions.
It would be odd, then, to treat them as involuntary.
