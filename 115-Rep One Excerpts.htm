<br>
I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, <a name="12"></a>that I might offer up my
prayers to the goddess; and also because I wanted <a name="13"></a>to see in what manner they would celebrate the
festival, which was a new <a name="14"></a>thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that <a name="15"></a>of
the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had finished <a name="16"></a>our prayers and viewed
the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the <a name="17"></a>city; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of
Cephalus chanced to catch <a name="18"></a>sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and
told <a name="19"></a>his servant to run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me <a name="20"></a>by the cloak behind,
and said: Polemarchus desires you to <a name="21"></a>wait. <a name="22"></a><br>
<br>
I turned round, and asked him where his master <a name="23"></a>was. <a name="24"></a><br>
There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only <a name="25"></a>wait. <a name="26"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus <a name="27"></a>appeared, and with him
Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus the son <a name="28"></a>of Nicias, and several others who had been at
the procession. <a name="29"></a><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold">Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS <a name="30"></a></span><br>

Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and our <a name="31"></a>companion are already on your
way to the city. <a name="32"></a><br>
<br>
You are not far wrong, I said. <a name="33"></a><br>
But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are? <a name="34"></a><br>
Of course. <a name="35"></a><br>
And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain <a name="36"></a>where you are. <a name="37"></a><br>
<br>
May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade <a name="38"></a>you to let us go? <a name="39"></a></span></p>

<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000000">Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback <a name="45"></a>in honour of the goddess
which will take place in the <a name="46"></a>evening? <a name="47"></a><br>
<br>
With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry <a name="48"></a>torches and pass them one to
another during the race? <a name="49"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will he <a name="50"></a>celebrated at night, which you
certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon <a name="51"></a>after supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering
of young <a name="52"></a>men, and we will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be <a name="53"></a>perverse. <a name="54"></a><br>
. . . .<a name="56"></a><br>
Very good, I replied. <a name="57"></a><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Glaucon - CEPHALUS - SOCRATES <a name="58"></a></span><br>
<br>
Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we <a name="59"></a>found his brothers Lysias and
Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the <a name="60"></a>Chalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and
Cleitophon the son of Aristonymus. <a name="61"></a>There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I
had not seen for <a name="62"></a>a long time, and I thought him very much aged. He was seated on a cushioned
<a name="63"></a>chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had been sacrificing in the <a name="64"></a>court; and there were
some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle, <a name="65"></a>upon which we sat down by him. He
saluted me eagerly, and then he said: <a name="66"></a>-- <a name="67"></a><br>
<br>
You don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I <a name="68"></a>were still able to go and see you I
would not ask you to come to me. But <a name="69"></a>at my age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you
should come oftener <a name="70"></a>to the Piraeus. For let me tell you, that the more the pleasures of the <a name="71"></a>body
fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation. <a name="72"></a>Do not then deny my
request, but make our house your resort and keep company <a name="73"></a>with these young men; we are old
friends, and you will be quite at home <a name="74"></a>with us. <a name="75"></a><br>
<br>
I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus, <a name="76"></a>than conversing with aged
men; for I regard them as travellers who have <a name="77"></a>gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of
whom I ought to enquire, <a name="78"></a>whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And this
is <a name="79"></a>a question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time <a name="80"></a>which the poets call
the 'threshold of old age' --Is life harder towards <a name="81"></a>the end, or what report do you give of it? <a name="82"></a><br>
<br>
I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men <a name="83"></a>of my age flock together; we are
birds of a feather, as the old proverb <a name="84"></a>says; and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance
commonly is --I cannot <a name="85"></a>eat, I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away: there
<a name="86"></a>was a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer life. <a name="87"></a>Some complain of the
slights which are put upon them by relations, and <a name="88"></a>they will tell you sadly of how many evils their
old age is the cause. <a name="89"></a>But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which is not
<a name="90"></a>really in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old, and every <a name="91"></a>other old man, would have
felt as they do. But this is not my own experience, <a name="92"></a>nor that of others whom I have known. How
well I remember the aged poet <a name="93"></a>Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit
with age, <a name="94"></a>Sophocles, --are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most gladly <a name="95"></a>have I
escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped <a name="96"></a>from a mad and furious master.
His words have often occurred to my mind <a name="97"></a>since, and they seem as good to me now as at the time
when he uttered them. <a name="98"></a>For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the
passions <a name="99"></a>relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp <a name="100"></a>not of one mad
master only, but of many. <span style="font-weight: bold">The truth is, Socrates, that these <a name="101"></a>regrets, and also the complaints
about relations, are to be attributed <a name="102"></a>to the same cause, which is not old age, but men's
characters and tempers; <a name="103"></a>for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the
pressure <a name="104"></a>of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are <a name="105"></a>equally a
burden. <a name="106"></a><br>
</span><br>
I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he <a name="107"></a>might go on --Yes, Cephalus, I
said: but I rather suspect that people in <a name="108"></a>general are not convinced by you when you speak thus;
<span style="font-weight: bold">they think that old <a name="109"></a>age sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but
because <a name="110"></a>you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great <a name="111"></a>comforter. <a name="112"></a><br>
</span><br>
You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is <a name="113"></a>something in what they say; not,
however, so much as they imagine. I might <a name="114"></a>answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian
who was abusing him <a name="115"></a>and saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but because he was
<a name="116"></a>an Athenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours, neither <a name="117"></a>of us would have been
famous.' And to those who are not rich and are impatient <a name="118"></a>of old age, <span style="font-weight: bold">the same reply may be
made; for to the good poor man old age <a name="119"></a>cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad rich man
ever have peace with <a name="120"></a>himself. <a name="121"></a><br>
</span><br>
May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part <a name="122"></a>inherited or acquired by you? <a name="123"></a><br>
<br>
Acquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In <a name="124"></a>the art of making money I
have been midway between my father and grandfather: <a name="125"></a>for my grandfather, whose name I bear,
doubled and trebled the value of <a name="126"></a>his patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I
possess now; but <a name="127"></a>my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present: and <a name="128"></a>I shall
be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little <a name="129"></a>more than I received. <a name="130"></a><br>
<br>
That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see <a name="131"></a>that you are indifferent about
money, which is a characteristic rather <a name="132"></a>of those who have inherited their fortunes than of those
who have acquired <a name="133"></a>them; the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation <a name="134"></a>of
their own, resembling the affection of authors
for their own poems, <a name="135"></a>or of parents for their
children, besides that natural love of it for the
<a name="136"></a>sake of use and profit which is common to
them and all men. And hence they <a name="137"></a>are very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but the
praises of <a name="138"></a>wealth. That is true, he said. <a name="139"></a><br>
<br>

<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>(2) What is the greatest blessing according to
Cephalus?</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #000000">Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question? <span style="font-weight: bold">What do <a name="140"></a>you consider to be the greatest
blessing which you have reaped from your <a name="141"></a>wealth? <a name="142"></a> <br>
</span><br>
One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others. <a name="143"></a>For let me tell you, Socrates,
that when a man thinks himself to be near <a name="144"></a>death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he
never had before; the <a name="145"></a>tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds
<a name="146"></a>done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he is tormented with <a name="147"></a>the thought that they
may be true: either from the weakness of age, or <a name="148"></a>because he is now drawing nearer to that other
place, he has a clearer <a name="149"></a>view of these things; suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him, and
<a name="150"></a>he begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others. And <a name="151"></a>when he finds that the
sum of his transgressions is great he will many <a name="152"></a>a time like a child start up in his sleep for fear,
and he is filled with <a name="153"></a>dark forebodings. But to him who is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as
<a name="154"></a>Pindar charmingly says, is the kind nurse of his age: <a name="155"></a><br>
Hope, he says, cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and <a name="156"></a>holiness and is the nurse
of his age and the companion of his journey; <a name="157"></a>--hope which is mightiest to sway the
restless soul of <a name="158"></a>man. <a name="159"></a></span></p>
<br>

<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 80%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>N.B. Notice this argument: It begins with a definition (e.g., justice is
speaking the truth and paying debts). Socrates finds an exception, namely,
that one ought not return a weapon to one &#8220;not in his right mind.&#8221; This
exception destroys the definition and the friends must seek a new
definition. This is the pattern for testing definitions used repeatedly by
Socrates, namely, trying to find an exception that requires changing the
definition.</p>
</span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000">How admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, <a name="160"></a>I do not say to every man, but to
a good man, is, that he has had no occasion <a name="161"></a>to deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or
unintentionally; <a name="162"></a>and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about
<a name="163"></a>offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to this peace <a name="164"></a>of mind the
possession of wealth greatly contributes; and therefore I say, <a name="165"></a>that, setting one thing against
another, of the many advantages which wealth <a name="166"></a>has to give, to a man of sense this is in my opinion
the <a name="167"></a>greatest. <a name="168"></a><br>
<br>
Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what <a name="169"></a>is it? --to speak the truth and to
pay your debts --no more than this? <a name="170"></a>And even to this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a
friend when in
<a name="171"></a>his right mind
has deposited
arms with me
and he asks for
them when he <a name="172"></a>is
not in his right
mind, ought I to
give them back
to him? No one would <a name="173"></a>say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than they
<a name="174"></a>would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his <a name="175"></a>condition. <a name="176"></a><br>
<br>
You are quite right, he replied. <a name="177"></a><br>
But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a <a name="178"></a>correct definition of justice. <a name="179"></a></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-weight: bold">Cephalus - SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS</span> <a name="180"></a><br>
<br>
Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said Polemarchus <a name="181"></a>interposing. <a name="182"></a><br>
<br>
I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after <a name="183"></a>the sacrifices, and I hand over
the argument to Polemarchus and the <a name="184"></a>company. <a name="185"></a><br>
<br>
Is not Polemarchus your heir? I said. <a name="186"></a><br>
To be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the <a name="187"></a>sacrifices. <a name="188"></a><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Socrates - POLEMARCHUS <a name="189"></a></span><br>
<br>
Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say, <a name="190"></a>and according to you truly
say, about justice? <a name="191"></a><br>
<br>
He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so <a name="192"></a>he appears to me to be right. <a name="193"></a><br>
<br>
I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired <a name="194"></a>man, but his meaning, though
probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear <a name="195"></a>to me.</span></p>
<br>

<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 46%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>N.B. Here&#8217;s an argument by analogy. See
if you can figure out its point.</p>
</span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000">. . . . <br>
<br>
Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have <a name="216"></a>spoken darkly of the nature of
justice; for he really meant to say that <a name="217"></a>justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and
this he termed <a name="218"></a>a debt. <a name="219"></a><br>
<br>
That must have been his meaning, he said. <a name="220"></a><br>
By heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what
due or proper thing <a name="221"></a>is given by medicine, and to
whom, what answer do you think that he would
<a name="222"></a>make to us? <a name="223"></a><br>
<br>
He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink <a name="224"></a>to human bodies. <a name="225"></a><br>
<br>
And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to <a name="226"></a>what? <a name="227"></a><br>
Seasoning to food. <a name="228"></a><br>
</span>
<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>Here&#8217;s a new definition of justice: giving
good to friends and evil to enemies. Can you
anticipate how Socrates will rebut it?</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>

<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 25%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>Another argument by
analogy.</p>
</span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000">And what is that which justice gives, and to whom? <a name="229"></a><br>
If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding <a name="230"></a>instances, then justice is
the art which gives good to friends and evil <a name="231"></a>to enemies. <a name="232"></a><br>
<br>
That is his meaning then? <a name="233"></a><br>
I think so. <a name="234"></a><br>
. . . . <br>
<a name="367"></a><br>
And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to <a name="368"></a>do good to our friends and harm
to our enemies, we should further say: <a name="369"></a>It is
just to do good to our friends when they are
good and harm to our <a name="370"></a>enemies when they are
evil? <a name="371"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, that appears to me to be the truth. <a name="372"></a><span style="font-weight: bold"><br>
But ought the just to injure any one at all? <a name="373"></a><br>
Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his <a name="374"></a>enemies. </span><a name="375"></a><br>
<br>
When horses are injured, are they improved or <a name="376"></a>deteriorated? <a name="377"></a><br>
The latter. <a name="378"></a><br>
Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not <a name="379"></a>of
dogs? <a name="380"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, of horses. <a name="381"></a><br>
And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of <a name="382"></a>horses? <a name="383"></a><br>
<br>
Of course. <a name="384"></a><br>
And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the <a name="385"></a>proper virtue of man? <a name="386"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly. <a name="387"></a><br>
And that human virtue is justice? <a name="388"></a><br>
To be sure. <a name="389"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust</span>? <a name="390"></a><br>
That is the result. <a name="391"></a><br>
But can the musician by his art make men unmusical? <a name="392"></a><br>
Certainly not. <a name="393"></a><br>
Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen? <a name="394"></a><br>
Impossible. <a name="395"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can <a name="396"></a>the good by virtue
make them bad? <a name="397"></a><br>
Assuredly not. </span><a name="398"></a><br>
Any more than heat can produce cold? <a name="399"></a><br>
It cannot. <a name="400"></a><br>
Or drought moisture? <a name="401"></a><br>
Clearly not. <a name="402"></a><br>
Nor can the good harm any one? <a name="403"></a><br>
Impossible. <a name="404"></a><br>
And the just is the good? <a name="405"></a><br>
Certainly. <a name="406"></a><span style="font-weight: bold"><br>
Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, <a name="407"></a>but of the opposite, who
is the unjust? <a name="408"></a><br>
I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates. </span><a name="409"></a></span></p>

what he says Socrates is not to do, namely,
define justice in terms of an interest. It takes
Socrates awhile to comment on this.</p>
</span></div>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts, <a name="410"></a>and that good is the debt which
a man owes to his friends, and evil the <a name="411"></a>debt which he owes to his enemies, --to say this is not
wise; for it is <a name="412"></a>not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be <a name="413"></a>in no case just.
<a name="414"></a><br>
<br>
I agree with you, said Polemarchus. <a name="415"></a><br>
<br>
. . . .<br>
 <br>
Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had <a name="430"></a>made an attempt to get the
argument into his own hands, and had been put <a name="431"></a>down by the rest of the company, who wanted to
hear the end. But when Polemarchus <a name="432"></a>and I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no
longer hold <a name="433"></a>his peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a wild beast, <a name="434"></a>seeking to
devour us. We were quite panic-stricken at the sight of <a name="435"></a>him. <a name="436"></a><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS <a name="437"></a></span><br>
<br>
He roared out to the whole company: What folly. Socrates, has taken <a name="438"></a>possession of you all? And
why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one <a name="439"></a>another? I say that if you want really to know what
justice is, you should <a name="440"></a>not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to yourself from
<a name="441"></a>the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many <a name="442"></a>a one who can ask
and cannot answer. And now I will not have
you say that <a name="443"></a>justice is duty or advantage or
profit or gain or interest, for this sort <a name="444"></a>of
nonsense will not do for me; I must have
clearness and <a name="445"></a>accuracy. <a name="446"></a>. . . . <br>
Listen, then, Thrasymachus said; I proclaim
that<span style="font-weight: bold"> justice is nothing else <a name="516"></a>than the interest
of the stronger</span>. And now why do you not me?
But of course <a name="517"></a>you won't. <a name="518"></a><br>
<br>
Let me first understand you, I replied. justice, as you say, is <a name="519"></a>the interest of the stronger. What,
Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this? <a name="520"></a>You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the

able to demolish, eventually, Thrasymachus&#8217;s

<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>

rulers to argue that justice is the interest of

&#8220;Might Makes Right.&#8221;</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than <a name="523"></a>he is, and right and just for
us? <a name="524"></a><br>
<br>
That's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense <a name="525"></a>which is most damaging to
the argument. <a name="526"></a><br>
<br>
Not at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them; <a name="527"></a>and I wish that you would be a
little clearer. <a name="528"></a><br>
<br>
Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ; <a name="529"></a>there are tyrannies, and
there are democracies, and there are <a name="530"></a>aristocracies? <a name="531"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, I know. <a name="532"></a><br>
And the government is the ruling power in each state? <a name="533"></a><br>
Certainly. <a name="534"></a><br>
And the different forms of government make laws democratical, aristocratical, <a name="535"></a>tyrannical, with a
view to their several interests; and these laws, which <a name="536"></a>are made by them for their own interests,
are the justice which they deliver <a name="537"></a>to their subjects, and him who transgresses them they punish as
a breaker <a name="538"></a>of the law, and unjust. And that is what I mean when I say that in all <a name="539"></a>states there is the
same principle of justice, which is the
interest of <a name="540"></a>the government; and as the
government must be supposed to have
power, the <a name="541"></a>only reasonable conclusion is,
that everywhere there is one principle of
<a name="542"></a>justice, which is the interest of the stronger. <a name="543"></a><br>
<br>
Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not <a name="544"></a>I will try to discover. But let me
remark, that in defining justice you <a name="545"></a>have yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me
to use. It <a name="546"></a>is true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are <a name="547"></a>added. <a name="548"></a><br>
<br>
A small addition, you must allow, he said. <a name="549"></a><br>
Great or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether <a name="550"></a>what you are saying is the
truth. Now we are both agreed that justice is <a name="551"></a>interest of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the
stronger'; about this <a name="552"></a>addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider <a name="553"></a>further. <a name="554"></a><br>
<br>
Proceed. <a name="555"></a><br>
I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it
is <span style="font-weight: bold">just or subjects <a name="556"></a>to obey their rulers</span>? <a name="557"></a><span style="font-weight: bold"><br>
<br>
I do. </span><a name="558"></a><br>
But are the rulers of states absolutely
infallible, or are they sometimes <a name="559"></a>liable to
</span>
<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>At this point, Socrates catches Thrasymachus
in the contradiction of saying that justice is in
the interest of the rulers and not in the
interest of the rulers because it is always just
to do whatever the rulers command even
when it is against their own interest. In logic,
any contradictory claim cannot be true; such
claims are called self-refuting.  </p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">err? <a name="560"></a><br>
<br>
To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err. <a name="561"></a><br>
Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and <a name="562"></a>sometimes not? <a name="563"></a><br>
<br>
True. <a name="564"></a><br>
When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest; <a name="565"></a>when they are
mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit <a name="566"></a>that? <a name="567"></a><br>
<br>
Yes. <a name="568"></a><br>
And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects, --and <a name="569"></a>that is what you call
justice? <a name="570"></a><br>
<br>
Doubtless. <a name="571"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Then justice, according to your argument,
is not only obedience to <a name="572"></a>the interest of the
stronger but the reverse?</span> <a name="573"></a><br>
<br>
What is that you are saying? he asked. <a name="574"></a><br>
I am only repeating what you are saying, I
believe. But let us consider: <a name="575"></a>Have we not
admitted that the rulers may be mistaken
about their own interest <a name="576"></a>in what they
command, and also that to obey them is justice? Has not that <a name="577"></a>been admitted? <a name="578"></a><br>
<br>
Yes. <a name="579"></a><span style="font-weight: bold"><br>
Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest <a name="580"></a>of the stronger,
when the rulers unintentionally command things to be done <a name="581"></a>which are to their own injury.</span>
For if, as you say, justice is the obedience <a name="582"></a>which the subject renders to their commands, in that
case, O wisest of <a name="583"></a>men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded <a name="584"></a>to
do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the injury of the <a name="585"></a>stronger? <a name="586"></a><br>
<br>
Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus. <a name="587"></a><br>
<br>
Socrates - CLEITOPHON - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS <a name="588"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his <a name="589"></a>witness. <a name="590"></a><br>
<br>
But there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for <span style="font-weight: bold">Thrasymachus <a name="591"></a>himself
acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for <a name="592"></a>their own interest, and
that for subjects to obey them is <a name="593"></a>justice.</span> <a name="594"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, Polemarchus, --Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what <a name="595"></a>was commanded by their
</span>
<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>At this point, Socrates&#8217;s friends are
wondering whether  Socrates&#8217;s rebuttal is
completely successful; they are puzzled
because Socrates&#8217;s rebuttal depends on the
rulers justly commanding what is not in their
interest and perhaps such commands are just
mistakes and not intrinsic to justice. If that is
the case, all Thrasymachus has to do to
escape the rebuttal is to claim that justice
does not make mistakes. And this is what
Thrasymachus does.</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">rulers is just. <a name="596"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest <a name="597"></a>of the stronger, and, while admitting
both these propositions, he further <a name="598"></a>acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker
who are his subjects <a name="599"></a>to do what is not for
the ruler&#8217;s own interest; whence follows
that justice is <a name="600"></a>injuries the ruler as much as
it benefits the stronger&#8217;s interest.<br>
<br>
But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the
interest of the stronger <a name="602"></a>what the stronger
thought to be his interest, --this was what
the weaker <a name="603"></a>had to do; and this was
affirmed by him to be justice. <a name="604"></a><br>
<br>
Those were not his words, rejoined
Polemarchus. <a name="605"></a><br>
<br>
Socrates - THRASYMACHUS <a name="606"></a><br>
<br>
Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept <a name="607"></a>his statement. Tell me,
Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what <a name="608"></a>the stronger thought to be his interest,
whether really so or <a name="609"></a>not? <a name="610"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken <a name="611"></a>the stronger at the time
when he is mistaken? <a name="612"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted <a name="613"></a>that the ruler was not
infallible but might be sometimes <a name="614"></a>mistaken. <a name="615"></a><br>
<br>
You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, <a name="616"></a>that he who is mistaken about
the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken? <a name="617"></a>or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an
arithmetician or grammarian <a name="618"></a>at the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake?
True, <a name="619"></a>we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake, <a name="620"></a>but this is
only a way of speaking; for the fact is that neither the grammarian <a name="621"></a>nor any other person of skill
ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what <a name="622"></a>his name implies; they none of them err unless their
skill fails them, <a name="623"></a>and then they cease to be skilled artists. No artist or sage or ruler errs <a name="624"></a>at the time
when he is what his name implies; though he is commonly said <a name="625"></a>to err, and I adopted the common
mode of speaking. But to be perfectly <a name="626"></a>accurate, since you are such a lover of accuracy, we should
say that the <a name="627"></a>ruler, in so far as he is the ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring, <a name="628"></a>always commands
that which is for his own interest; and the subject is <a name="629"></a>required to execute his commands; and
therefore, as I said at first and <a name="630"></a>now repeat, justice is the interest of the stronger. <a name="631"></a><br>
<br>
</span>
<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>3) This argument by analogy takes the ruler
or the stronger to be like a physician or like a
pilot of a boat. If the analogy holds, then the
interest of the stronger must be like the
interest of the physician and the pilot. But is
the interest of the physician and the pilots his
own benefit or the benefit of others?</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like <a name="632"></a>an informer? <a name="633"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly, he replied. <a name="634"></a><br>
And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring <a name="635"></a>you in the argument? <a name="636"></a><br>
<br>
Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word --I know it; but you <a name="637"></a>will be found out, and by sheer
force of argument you will never <a name="638"></a>prevail. <a name="639"></a><br>
<br>
I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any misunderstanding <a name="640"></a>occurring between
us in future, let me ask, in what sense do you speak <a name="641"></a>of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you
were saying, he being the <a name="642"></a>superior, it is just that the inferior should execute --is he a ruler in <a name="643"></a>the
popular or in the strict sense of the term? <a name="644"></a><br>
<br>
In the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play <a name="645"></a>the informer if you can; I ask no
quarter at your hands. But you never <a name="646"></a>will be able, never. <a name="647"></a><br>
<br>
And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and <a name="648"></a>cheat, Thrasymachus? I might
as well shave a lion. <a name="649"></a><br>
<br>
Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you <a name="650"></a>failed. <a name="651"></a><br>
Enough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should <a name="652"></a>ask you a question: Is the
physician, taken in that strict sense of which
<a name="653"></a>you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a
maker of money? And remember <a name="654"></a>that I am
now speaking of the true physician. <a name="655"></a><br>
<br>
A healer of the sick, he replied. <a name="656"></a><br>
And the pilot --that is to say, the true pilot
--is he a captain of <a name="657"></a>sailors or a mere sailor? <a name="658"></a><br>
<br>
A captain of sailors. <a name="659"></a><br>
The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into <a name="660"></a>account; neither is he to be called
a sailor; the name pilot by which he <a name="661"></a>is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is
significant of <a name="662"></a>his skill and of his authority over the sailors. <a name="663"></a><br>
<br>
Very true, he said. <a name="664"></a><br>
Now, I said, <span style="font-weight: bold">every art has an interest</span>? <a name="665"></a><br>
Certainly. <a name="666"></a><br>
For which the art has to consider and provide? <a name="667"></a><br>
Yes, that is the aim of art. <a name="668"></a><br>
And <span style="font-weight: bold">the interest of any art is the perfection of it</span> --this and nothing <a name="669"></a>else? <a name="670"></a><br>
<br>
What do you mean? <a name="671"></a><br>
</span>
<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>Whenever the opposite consents reluctantly,
his reluctance signals that he knows the

concession is so important.</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body. <a name="672"></a>Suppose you were to ask me
whether the body is self-sufficing or has wants, <a name="673"></a>I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for
the body may be ill and <a name="674"></a>require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which the art of
medicine <a name="675"></a>ministers; and this is the origin and intention of medicine, as you will <a name="676"></a>acknowledge.
Am I not right? <a name="677"></a><br>
<br>
Quite right, he replied. <a name="678"></a><br>
But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in <a name="679"></a>any quality in the same way that
the eye may be deficient in sight or the <a name="680"></a>ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to
provide for <a name="681"></a>the interests of seeing and hearing --has art in itself, I say, any similar <a name="682"></a>liability to fault
or defect, and does every art require another supplementary <a name="683"></a>art to provide for its interests, and
that another and another without <a name="684"></a>end? Or have the arts to look only after their own interests? Or
have they <a name="685"></a>no need either of themselves or of another? --having no faults or defects, <a name="686"></a>they have no
need to correct them, either by the exercise of their own <a name="687"></a>art or of any other; they have only to
consider the interest of their subject-matter. <a name="688"></a>For every art remains pure and faultless while
remaining true --that is <a name="689"></a>to say, while perfect and unimpaired. Take the words in your precise
sense, <a name="690"></a>and tell me whether I am not right." <a name="691"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, clearly. <a name="692"></a><br>
Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the interest <a name="693"></a>of the body? <a name="694"></a><br>
<br>
True, he said. <a name="695"></a><br>
Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art <a name="696"></a>of horsemanship, but the
interests of the horse; neither do any other arts <a name="697"></a>care for themselves, for they have no needs; they
care only for that which <a name="698"></a>is the subject of their art? <a name="699"></a><br>
<br>
True, he said. <a name="700"></a><br>
But surely, Thrasymachus,<span style="font-weight: bold"> the arts are the superiors and rulers of <a name="701"></a>their own subjects</span>? <a name="702"></a><br>
<br>
To this he assented with a good deal of <span style="font-weight: bold">reluctance. </span><a name="703"></a><br>
Then, I said, no science or art considers or
enjoins the interest of <a name="704"></a>the stronger or
superior, but only the interest of the subject
and <a name="705"></a>weaker? <a name="706"></a><br>
<br>
He made an attempt to contest this
proposition also, but finally <a name="707"></a>acquiesced. <a name="708"></a><br>
<br>
Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as
he is a physician, <a name="709"></a>considers his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient; <a name="710"></a>for
the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject, <a name="711"></a>and is not a mere
money-maker; that has been admitted? <a name="712"></a><br>
<br>
</span>
<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>At this point, Thrasymachus has lost the
argument. But since he is not convinced, he
attacks the character of Socrates. This is
always a slimy fallacious move.
Unfortunately, it is not uncommon and so it
has a name the Ad hominem Fallacy</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Yes. <a name="713"></a><br>
And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler <a name="714"></a>of sailors and not a mere sailor? <a name="715"></a><br>
<br>
That has been admitted. <a name="716"></a><br>
And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest <a name="717"></a>of the sailor who is under
him, and not for his own or the ruler's <a name="718"></a>interest? <a name="719"></a><br>
<br>
He gave <span style="font-weight: bold">a reluctant 'Yes.</span>' <a name="720"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Then, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so <a name="721"></a>far as he is a ruler,
considers or enjoins what is for his own interest, <a name="722"></a>but always what is for the interest of his
subject or suitable to his art; <a name="723"></a>to that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything
which he says <a name="724"></a>and does. </span><a name="725"></a><br>
<br>
When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw <a name="726"></a>that the definition of justice
had been completely upset, Thrasymachus, <a name="727"></a>instead of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates,
have you got a <a name="728"></a>nurse? <a name="729"></a><br>
<br>
Why do you ask such a question, I said, when
you ought rather to <a name="730"></a>be answering? <a name="731"></a><br>
<br>
Because she leaves you to snivel, and never
wipes your nose: she <a name="732"></a>has not even taught you
to know the shepherd from the <a name="733"></a>sheep. <a name="734"></a><br>
<br>
What makes you say that? I replied. <a name="735"></a><br>
Because you fancy that the <span style="font-weight: bold">shepherd fattens the sheep or oxen or tends to them with a view
to their own good and not to the good of himself <a name="737"></a>or his master</span>[&#8211;as do rulers, But] you further
imagine that the rulers of states, if they <a name="738"></a>are true rulers, never think of their subjects as sheep, and
that they <a name="739"></a>are not studying their own advantage day and night. Oh, no; and so entirely <a name="740"></a>astray are
you in your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know <a name="741"></a>that justice and the just are in
reality another's good; that is to say, <a name="742"></a>the interest of the ruler and stronger, and the loss of the
subject and <a name="743"></a>servant; and injustice the opposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly <a name="744"></a>simple and
just: he is the stronger, and his subjects do what is for his <a name="745"></a>interest, and minister to his happiness,
which is very far from being their <a name="746"></a>own. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Consider further, most foolish Socrates, that<span style="font-weight: bold"> the just is always a <a name="747"></a>loser in comparison
with the unjust. </span>First of all, in private contracts: <a name="748"></a>wherever the unjust is the partner of the just
you will find that, when <a name="749"></a>the partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has always more and the just
<a name="750"></a>less. Secondly, in their dealings with the State: when there is an income <a name="751"></a>tax, the just man will pay
more and the unjust less on the same amount <a name="752"></a>of income; and when there is anything to be
received the one gains nothing <a name="753"></a>and the other much. Observe also what happens when they take an
office; <a name="754"></a>there is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other <a name="755"></a>losses, and getting
nothing out of the public, because he is just; moreover <a name="756"></a>he is hated by his friends and
acquaintance for refusing to serve them <a name="757"></a>in unlawful ways. But all this is reversed in the case of
the unjust man. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><a name="758"></a>I am speaking, as before, of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage <a name="759"></a>of the unjust
is more apparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen<span style="font-weight: bold"> <a name="760"></a>if we turn to that highest form of
injustice in which the criminal is the <a name="761"></a>happiest of men</span>, and the sufferers or those who refuse to
do injustice <a name="762"></a>are the most miserable --that is to say tyranny, which by fraud and force <a name="763"></a>takes away
the property of others, not little by little but wholesale; <a name="764"></a>comprehending in one, things sacred as
well as profane, private and public; <a name="765"></a>for which acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating any
one of them <a name="766"></a>singly, he would be punished and incur great disgrace --they who do such <a name="767"></a>wrong in
particular cases are called robbers of temples, and man-stealers <a name="768"></a>and burglars and swindlers and
thieves. But when a man besides taking away <a name="769"></a>the money of the citizens has made slaves of them,
then, instead of these <a name="770"></a>names of reproach, he is termed happy and blessed, not only by the citizens
<a name="771"></a>but by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice. <a name="772"></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">For mankind censure injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of <a name="773"></a>it and not
because they shrink from committing it. </span>And thus, as I have <a name="774"></a>shown, Socrates, <span style="font-weight: bold">injustice, when
on a sufficient scale, has more strength <a name="775"></a>and freedom and mastery than justice</span>; and, as I said
at first, justice <a name="776"></a>is the interest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit <a name="777"></a>and interest. <a name="778"></a><br>
<br>
Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bathman, <a name="779"></a>deluged our ears with his
words, had a mind to go away. But the company <a name="780"></a>would not let him; they insisted that he should
remain and defend his position; <a name="781"></a>and I myself added my own humble request that he would not
leave us. Thrasymachus, <a name="782"></a>I said to him, excellent man, how suggestive are your remarks! And are
<a name="783"></a>you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether <a name="784"></a>they are true or not? Is
the attempt to determine the way of man's life <a name="785"></a>so small a matter in your eyes --to determine how
life may be passed by <a name="786"></a>each one of us to the greatest advantage? <a name="787"></a><br>
<br>
And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the <a name="788"></a>enquiry? <a name="789"></a><br>
<br>
You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about <a name="790"></a>us, Thrasymachus --whether we
live better or worse from not knowing what <a name="791"></a>you say you know, is to you a matter of indifference.
Prithee, friend, <a name="792"></a>do not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any benefit
<a name="793"></a>which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own part I openly <a name="794"></a>declare that I am
not convinced, and that I do not believe injustice to <a name="795"></a>be more gainful than justice, even if
uncontrolled and allowed to have <a name="796"></a>free play.<span style="font-weight: bold"> For, granting that there may be an unjust man
who is able to <a name="797"></a>commit injustice either by fraud or force, still this does not convince <a name="798"></a>me of
the superior advantage of injustice</span>, and there may be others who <a name="799"></a>are in the same predicament
with myself. Perhaps we may be wrong; if so, <a name="800"></a>you in your wisdom should convince us that we are
mistaken in preferring <a name="801"></a>justice to injustice. <a name="802"></a><br>
<br>
And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced <a name="803"></a>by what I have just said;
what more can I do for you? Would you have me <a name="804"></a>put the proof bodily into your souls? <a name="805"></a><br>
<br>
Heaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, <a name="806"></a>if you change, change openly
and let there be no deception. For I must <a name="807"></a>remark, Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was

<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>N.B. Socrates deftly separates the goal of an
art from money making; he thereby separates
the end of an art (e.g., medicine) from the
benefit of its practioner.</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">previously said, that <a name="808"></a>although you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you <a name="809"></a>did
not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought <a name="810"></a>that the shepherd as a
shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their <a name="811"></a>own good, but like a mere diner or banqueter
with a view to the pleasures <a name="812"></a>of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the market, and not as <a name="813"></a>a
shepherd. <span style="font-weight: bold">Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the <a name="814"></a>good of his subjects;
he has only to provide the best for them</span>, since the <a name="815"></a>perfection of the art is already ensured
whenever all the requirements <a name="816"></a>of it are satisfied. And that was what I was saying just now about
the <a name="817"></a>ruler. I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered as ruler, whether <a name="818"></a>in a state or in private
life, could only regard the good of his flock <a name="819"></a>or subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers
in states, that <a name="820"></a>is to say, the true rulers, like being in authority. <a name="821"></a><br>
<br>
Think! Nay, I am sure of it. <a name="822"></a><br>
Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly <a name="823"></a>without payment, unless
under the idea that they govern for the advantage <a name="824"></a>not of themselves but of others? Let me ask you
a question: Are not the <a name="825"></a>several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate function?
<a name="826"></a>And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we may make <a name="827"></a>a little progress. <a name="828"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, that is the difference, he replied. <a name="829"></a><br>
And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one <a name="830"></a>--medicine, for example,
gives us health; navigation, safety at sea, and <a name="831"></a>so on? <a name="832"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, he said. <a name="833"></a><br>
And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but <a name="834"></a>we do not confuse this with
other arts, any more than the art of the pilot <a name="835"></a>is to be confused with the art of medicine, because
the health of the pilot <a name="836"></a>may be improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined to say,
would <a name="837"></a>you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt <a name="838"></a>your exact use of
language? <a name="839"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly not. <a name="840"></a><br>
Or <span style="font-weight: bold">because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not <a name="841"></a>say that the art of
payment is medicine? <a name="842"></a><br>
<br>
I should say not. <a name="843"></a><br>
</span>Nor would you say that medicine is the art of
receiving pay because <a name="844"></a>a man takes fees when
he is engaged in healing? <a name="845"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly not. <a name="846"></a><br>
And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially <a name="847"></a>confined to the art? <a name="848"></a><br>
<br>
Yes. <a name="849"></a><br>
Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is <a name="850"></a>to be attributed to something
of which they all have the common <a name="851"></a>use? <a name="852"></a><br>
<br>
True, he replied. <a name="853"></a><br>
And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is <a name="854"></a>gained by an additional use of
the art of pay, which is not the art professed <a name="855"></a>by him? <a name="856"></a><br>
<br>
He gave a reluctant assent to this. <a name="857"></a><br>
Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective <a name="858"></a>arts. But the truth is, that
while the art of medicine gives health, and <a name="859"></a>the art of the builder builds a house, another art
attends them which is <a name="860"></a>the art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own business and
benefiting <a name="861"></a>that over which they preside, but would the artist receive any benefit <a name="862"></a>from his art
unless he were paid as well? <a name="863"></a><br>
<br>
I suppose not. <a name="864"></a><br>
But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for <a name="865"></a>nothing? <a name="866"></a><br>
Certainly, he confers a benefit. <a name="867"></a><br>
Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts <a name="868"></a>nor governments provide
for their own interests; but, as we were before <a name="869"></a>saying, they rule and provide for the interests of
their subjects who are <a name="870"></a>the weaker and not the stronger --to their good they attend and not to <a name="871"></a>the
good of the superior. <a name="872"></a><br>
<br>
And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus, why, as I was just <a name="873"></a>now saying, no one is willing to
govern; because no one likes to take in <a name="874"></a>hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern
without remuneration. <a name="875"></a><span style="font-weight: bold">For, in the execution of his work, and in giving his orders to another,
<a name="876"></a>the true artist does not regard his own interest, but always that of his <a name="877"></a>subjects</span>; and therefore
in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they <a name="878"></a>must be paid in one of three modes of payment:
money, or honour, or a penalty <a name="879"></a>for refusing. <a name="880"></a><span style="font-weight: bold"><br>
<br>
Socrates - GLAUCON </span><a name="881"></a><br>
<br>
What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of <a name="882"></a>payment are intelligible
enough, but what the penalty is I do not understand, <a name="883"></a>or how a penalty can be a payment. <a name="884"></a><br>
<br>
You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment <a name="885"></a>which to the best men is the
great inducement to rule? Of course you know <a name="886"></a>that ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed
they are, a <a name="887"></a>disgrace? <a name="888"></a><br>
<br>
Very true. <a name="889"></a><br>
And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for <a name="890"></a>them; good men do not wish
to be openly demanding payment for governing <a name="891"></a>and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by
secretly helping themselves <a name="892"></a>out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being
ambitious <a name="893"></a>they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them, <a name="894"></a>and they
must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment. And this, <a name="895"></a>as I imagine, is the reason why
the forwardness to take office, instead <a name="896"></a>of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed
</span>
<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>The discussion now shifts to whether the life
of justice or injustice is better.</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">dishonourable. Now <span style="font-weight: bold">the worst <a name="897"></a>part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable
to be ruled <a name="898"></a>by one who is worse than himself.</span> And the fear of this, as I conceive, <a name="899"></a>induces the
good to take office, not because they would, but because they <a name="900"></a>cannot help --not under the idea
that they are going to have any benefit <a name="901"></a>or enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because
they are not able <a name="902"></a>to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, <a name="903"></a>or indeed
as good. For there is reason to think that if a city were composed <a name="904"></a>entirely of good men, then to
avoid office would be as much an object of <a name="905"></a>contention as to obtain office is at present; then we
should have plain <a name="906"></a>proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, <a name="907"></a>but
that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather <a name="908"></a>to receive a benefit from
another than to have the trouble of conferring <a name="909"></a>one. So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus
that justice is the interest <a name="910"></a>of the stronger. This latter question need not be further discussed at
<a name="911"></a>present; but when Thrasymachus says that the<span style="font-weight: bold"> life of the unjust is more <a name="912"></a>advantageous than
that of the just, his new statement appears to me to <a name="913"></a>be of a far more serious character</span>.
Which of us has spoken truly? And which <a name="914"></a>sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer? <a name="915"></a><br>
<br>
I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, <a name="916"></a>he answered. <a name="917"></a><br>
<br>
Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus <a name="918"></a>was rehearsing? <a name="919"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced <a name="920"></a>me. <a name="921"></a><br>
Then shall we try to find some way of
convincing him, if we can, that <a name="922"></a>he is
saying what is not true? <a name="923"></a><br>
<br>
. . . . <br>
<br>
Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning <a name="935"></a>and answer me. You say
that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect <a name="936"></a>justice? <a name="937"></a><br>
<br>
Socrates - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS <a name="938"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my <a name="939"></a>reasons. <a name="940"></a><br>
And what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue <a name="941"></a>and the other vice? <a name="942"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly. <a name="943"></a><br>
I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice <a name="944"></a>vice? <a name="945"></a><br>
What a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice <a name="946"></a>to be profitable and justice
not. <a name="947"></a><br>
<br>
What else then would you say? <a name="948"></a><br>
The opposite, he replied. <a name="949"></a><br>
And would you call justice vice? <a name="950"></a><br>
No, I would rather say sublime simplicity. <a name="951"></a><br>
</span>
<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 46%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>Alas, more Thrasymachus, he just
doomed his argument that injustice is
better than justice. Can you figure out
how?</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Then would you call injustice malignity? <a name="952"></a><br>
No; I would rather say discretion. <a name="953"></a><br>
And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good? <a name="954"></a><br>
Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly <a name="955"></a>unjust, and who have the
power of subduing states and nations; but perhaps <a name="956"></a>you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses. <a name="957"></a><br>
<br>
Even this profession if undetected has advantages, though they <a name="958"></a>are not to be compared with those
of which I was just now <a name="959"></a>speaking. <a name="960"></a><br>
<br>
I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, <a name="961"></a>I replied; but still I cannot hear
without amazement that you class injustice <a name="962"></a>with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the
opposite. <a name="963"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly I do so class them. <a name="964"></a><br>
Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground; <a name="965"></a>for if the injustice
which you were maintaining to be profitable had been <a name="966"></a>admitted by you as by others to be vice
and deformity, an answer might <a name="967"></a>have been given to you on received principles; but now I
perceive that <a name="968"></a>you will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust you will <a name="969"></a>attribute all
the qualities which were attributed by us before to the just, <a name="970"></a>seeing that you do not hesitate to rank
injustice with wisdom and <a name="971"></a>virtue. <a name="972"></a><br>
<br>
You have guessed most infallibly, he replied. <a name="973"></a><br>
Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument <a name="974"></a>so long as I have
reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are speaking <a name="975"></a>your real mind; for I do believe that you are
now in earnest and are not <a name="976"></a>amusing yourself at our expense. <a name="977"></a><br>
<br>
I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you? --to refute <a name="978"></a>the argument is your business. <a name="979"></a><br>
<br>
Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so <a name="980"></a>good as answer yet one more
question? <span style="font-weight: bold">Does the just man try to gain any
<a name="981"></a>advantage over the just? <a name="982"></a><br>
</span><br>
Far otherwise; if he did would not be the simple,
amusing creature <a name="983"></a>which he is. <a name="984"></a><br>
<br>
And would he try to go beyond just action? <a name="985"></a><br>
He would not. <a name="986"></a><br>
And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust; <a name="987"></a>would that be
considered by him as just or unjust? <a name="988"></a><br>
<br>
He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but <a name="989"></a>he would not be able. <a name="990"></a><br>
<br>
Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point. <a name="991"></a>My question is only whether
the just man, while refusing to have more than <a name="992"></a>another just man, would wish and claim to have
more than the <a name="993"></a>unjust? <a name="994"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, he would. <a name="995"></a><br>
And what of the unjust --does he claim to have more than the just man <a name="996"></a>and to do more than is just
<a name="997"></a><br>
<br>
Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all <a name="998"></a>men. <a name="999"></a><br>
And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the <a name="1000"></a>unjust man or action, in order
that he may have more than <a name="1001"></a>all? <a name="1002"></a><br>
<br>
True. <a name="1003"></a><span style="font-weight: bold"><br>
We may put the matter thus, I said --the just does not desire more <a name="1004"></a>than his like but more
than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more <a name="1005"></a>than both his like and his unlike? </span><a name="1006"></a><br>
<br>
Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement. <a name="1007"></a><br>
And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is <a name="1008"></a>neither? <a name="1009"></a><br>
Good again, he said. <a name="1010"></a><br>
And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike <a name="1011"></a>them? <a name="1012"></a><br>
<br>
Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those <a name="1013"></a>who are of a certain nature; he who
is not, not. <a name="1014"></a><br>
<br>
Each of them, I said, is such as his like is? <a name="1015"></a><br>
Certainly, he replied. <a name="1016"></a><br>
Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts: <a name="1017"></a>you would admit that one
man is a musician and another not a <a name="1018"></a>musician? <a name="1019"></a><br>
<br>
Yes. <a name="1020"></a><br>
And which is wise and which is foolish? <a name="1021"></a><br>
Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is <a name="1022"></a>foolish. <a name="1023"></a><br>
<br>
And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he <a name="1024"></a>is foolish? <a name="1025"></a><br>
<br>
Yes. <a name="1026"></a><br>
And you would say the same sort of thing of the <a name="1027"></a>physician? <a name="1028"></a><br>
Yes. <a name="1029"></a><br>
And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts <a name="1030"></a>the lyre would desire or
claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the <a name="1031"></a>tightening and loosening the strings? <a name="1032"></a><br>
<br>
I do not think that he would. <a name="1033"></a><br>
But he would claim to exceed the non-musician? <a name="1034"></a><br>
Of course. <a name="1035"></a><br>
And what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and drinks <a name="1036"></a>would he wish to go
beyond another physician or beyond the practice of <a name="1037"></a>medicine? <a name="1038"></a><br>
<br>
He would not. <a name="1039"></a><br>
But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician? <a name="1040"></a><br>
Yes. <a name="1041"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold">And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think <a name="1042"></a>that any man who
has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying <a name="1043"></a>or doing more than another
man who has knowledge. Would he not rather say <a name="1044"></a>or do the same as his like in the same
case? <a name="1045"></a><br>
<br>
That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.</span> <a name="1046"></a><br>
And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either <a name="1047"></a>the knowing or the
ignorant? <a name="1048"></a><br>
<br>
I dare say. <a name="1049"></a><br>
And the knowing is wise? <a name="1050"></a><br>
Yes. <a name="1051"></a><br>
And the wise is good? <a name="1052"></a><br>
True. <a name="1053"></a><br>
Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, <a name="1054"></a>but more than his unlike and
opposite? <a name="1055"></a><br>
<br>
I suppose so. <a name="1056"></a><br>
Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than <a name="1057"></a>both? <a name="1058"></a><br>
Yes. <a name="1059"></a><br>
But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both <a name="1060"></a>his like and unlike? Were
not these your words? They <a name="1061"></a>were. <a name="1062"></a><br>
<br>
They were. <a name="1063"></a><br>
And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his <a name="1064"></a>unlike? <a name="1065"></a><br>
<br>
Yes. <a name="1066"></a><br>
Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil <a name="1067"></a>and ignorant? <a name="1068"></a><br>
<br>
That is the inference. <a name="1069"></a><br>
And each of them is such as his like is? <a name="1070"></a><br>
That was admitted. <a name="1071"></a><br>
Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil <a name="1072"></a>and ignorant. <a name="1073"></a><br>
<br>
Thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as I repeat <a name="1074"></a>them, but with<span style="font-weight: bold"> extreme
reluctance; </span>it was a hot summer's day, and the perspiration <a name="1075"></a>poured from him in torrents; and then
</span>
<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 41%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>4) Why did Thrasymachus blush?</p>
</span></div>
<span style="color: #000000"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">I saw what I had never seen before,
<a name="1076"></a><span style="font-weight: bold">Thrasymachus blushing. </span></span></p>

<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>WOW! The wild and violent Thrasymachus
now converses civilly; he has been tamed.
How so?</p>
</span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As we were now agreed that justice was
virtue and <a name="1077"></a>wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, I proceeded to another <a name="1078"></a>point: <a name="1079"></a><br>
<br>
Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were <a name="1080"></a>we not also saying that injustice
had strength; do you <a name="1081"></a>remember? <a name="1082"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of <a name="1083"></a>what you are saying or have no
answer; if however I were to answer, you <a name="1084"></a>would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing;
therefore either permit <a name="1085"></a>me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will
answer <a name="1086"></a>'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' <a name="1087"></a>and 'No.' <a name="1088"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly not, I said, if contrary to your real <a name="1089"></a>opinion. <a name="1090"></a><br>
Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak. <a name="1091"></a>What else would you have? <a name="1092"></a><br>
<br>
Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will <a name="1093"></a>ask and you shall answer. <a name="1094"></a><br>
<br>
Proceed. <a name="1095"></a><br>
Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order that <a name="1096"></a>our examination of the relative
nature of justice and injustice may be <a name="1097"></a>carried on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is
stronger and <a name="1098"></a>more powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified with <a name="1099"></a>wisdom
and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice, if injustice <a name="1100"></a>is ignorance; this can no
longer be questioned by any one. But I want to <a name="1101"></a>view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different
way: You would not deny that <a name="1102"></a>a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave
other states, <a name="1103"></a>or may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in
<a name="1104"></a>subjection? <a name="1105"></a><br>
<br>
True, he replied; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust <a name="1106"></a>state will be most likely to do so. <a name="1107"></a><br>
<br>
I know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further <a name="1108"></a>consider is, whether this
power which is possessed by the superior state <a name="1109"></a>can exist or be exercised without justice. <a name="1110"></a><br>
<br>
If you are right in you view, and justice is wisdom, then only <a name="1111"></a>with justice; but if I am right, then
without justice. <a name="1112"></a><br>
<br>
I am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see
you not only nodding assent <a name="1113"></a>and
dissent, but making answers which
are quite excellent. <a name="1114"></a><br>
<br>
That is out of civility to you, he
replied. <a name="1115"></a></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">You are very kind, I said; <span style="font-weight: bold">and would you have the goodness also to <a name="1116"></a>inform me, whether you
think that a state, or an army, or a band of robbers <a name="1117"></a>and thieves, or any other gang of
evil-doers could act at all if they injured <a name="1118"></a>one another? </span><a name="1119"></a><br>
<br>
No indeed, he said, they could not. <a name="1120"></a><br>
But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act <a name="1121"></a>together better? <a name="1122"></a><br>
<br>
Yes. <a name="1123"></a><br>
And this is because <span style="font-weight: bold">injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting, <a name="1124"></a>and justice imparts
harmony and friendship; </span>is not that true, <a name="1125"></a>Thrasymachus? <a name="1126"></a><br>
<br>
I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with <a name="1127"></a>you. <a name="1128"></a><br>
How good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether injustice, <a name="1129"></a>having this tendency to
arouse hatred, wherever existing, among slaves <a name="1130"></a>or among freemen, will not make them hate one
another and set them at variance <a name="1131"></a>and render them incapable of common action? <a name="1132"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly. <a name="1133"></a><br>
And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and <a name="1134"></a>fight, and become enemies
to one another and to the <a name="1135"></a>just <a name="1136"></a><br>
<br>
They will. <a name="1137"></a><br>
And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom <a name="1138"></a>say that she loses or that
she retains her natural power? <a name="1139"></a><br>
<br>
Let us assume that she retains her power. <a name="1140"></a><br>
Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that <a name="1141"></a>wherever she takes up her
abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a family, <a name="1142"></a>or in any other body, that body is, to begin with,
rendered incapable of <a name="1143"></a>united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and does it not become
<a name="1144"></a>its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it, and with the just? <a name="1145"></a>Is not this the case? <a name="1146"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, certainly. <a name="1147"></a><br>
And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; <a name="1148"></a>in the first place rendering him
incapable of action because he is not <a name="1149"></a>at unity with himself, and in the second place making him
an enemy to himself <a name="1150"></a>and the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus? <a name="1151"></a><br>
<br>
Yes. <a name="1152"></a><br>
And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just? <a name="1153"></a><br>
Granted that they are. <a name="1154"></a><br>
But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will <a name="1155"></a>be their friend? <a name="1156"></a><br>
<br>
Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will <a name="1157"></a>not oppose you, lest I should
displease the company. <a name="1158"></a><br>
<br>
Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder <a name="1159"></a>of my repast. For we have
already shown that the<span style="font-weight: bold"> just are clearly wiser <a name="1160"></a>and better and abler than the unjust, and that
the unjust are incapable <a name="1161"></a>of common action</span>; . . . to speak as we did of men who are <a name="1162"></a>evil acting
at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for <a name="1163"></a><span style="font-weight: bold">if they had been perfectly evil, they
would have laid hands upon one another; <a name="1164"></a>but it is evident that there must have been some
remnant of justice in <a name="1165"></a>them, which enabled them to combine;</span> if there had not been they would
have <a name="1166"></a>injured one another as well as their victims; they were but half --villains <a name="1167"></a>in their enterprises;
for had they been whole villains, and utterly unjust, <a name="1168"></a>they would have been utterly incapable of
action. That, as I believe, is <a name="1169"></a>the truth of the matter, and not what you said at first. </span></p>

<div class="WPParaTextBoxWrapper" style="width: 50%; float: left; clear: left"><span class="WPParaTextBox" style="border: 0.0133333in solid #000000"><p>At this point, the argument rules out injustice
as the foundation of happiness and turns to
the question of whether justice is part of
happiness. The argument that follows can be
called Plato&#8217;s Function Argument.</p>
</span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>But whether <span style="font-weight: bold">the <a name="1170"></a>just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further
question <a name="1171"></a>which we also proposed to consider. I think that they have, and for the <a name="1172"></a>reasons
which to have given; but still I should like to examine further, <a name="1173"></a>for no light matter is at
stake, nothing less
than the rule of
human <a name="1174"></a>life. </span><a name="1175"></a><br>
<br>
</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Proceed. <a name="1176"></a><br>
I will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse <a name="1177"></a>has some end? <a name="1178"></a><br>
<br>
I should. <a name="1179"></a><br>
And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could <a name="1180"></a>not be accomplished, or
not so well accomplished, by any other <a name="1181"></a>thing? <a name="1182"></a><br>
<br>
I do not understand, he said. <a name="1183"></a><br>
Let me explain: Can you see, except with the eye? <a name="1184"></a><br>
Certainly not. <a name="1185"></a><br>
Or hear, except with the ear? <a name="1186"></a><br>
No. <a name="1187"></a><br>
These then may be truly said to be the ends of these <a name="1188"></a>organs? <a name="1189"></a><br>
They may. <a name="1190"></a><br>
But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and <a name="1191"></a>in many other ways? <a name="1192"></a><br>
<br>
Of course. <a name="1193"></a><br>
And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the <a name="1194"></a>purpose? <a name="1195"></a><br>
True. <a name="1196"></a><br>
May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook? <a name="1197"></a><br>
We may. <a name="1198"></a><br>
Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning <a name="1199"></a>when I asked the
question whether the end of anything would be that which <a name="1200"></a>could not be accomplished, or not so
well accomplished, by any other <a name="1201"></a>thing? <a name="1202"></a><br>
<br>
I understand your meaning, he said, and assent. <a name="1203"></a><br>
And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need <a name="1204"></a>I ask again whether the eye
has an end? <a name="1205"></a><br>
<br>
It has. <a name="1206"></a><br>
And has not the eye an excellence? <a name="1207"></a><br>
Yes. <a name="1208"></a><br>
And the ear has an end and an excellence also? <a name="1209"></a><br>
True. <a name="1210"></a><br>
And the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an <a name="1211"></a>end and a special excellence? <a name="1212"></a><br>
<br>
That is so. <a name="1213"></a><br>
Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their <a name="1214"></a>own proper excellence and have
a defect instead? <a name="1215"></a><br>
<br>
How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot <a name="1216"></a>see? <a name="1217"></a><br>
You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is <a name="1218"></a>sight; but I have not arrived
at that point yet. I would rather ask the <a name="1219"></a>question more generally, and only enquire whether the
things which fulfil <a name="1220"></a>their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fall of fulfilling
<a name="1221"></a>them by their own defect? <a name="1222"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly, he replied. <a name="1223"></a><br>
I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper <a name="1224"></a>excellence they cannot fulfil
their end? <a name="1225"></a><br>
<br>
True. <a name="1226"></a><br>
And the same observation will apply to all other <a name="1227"></a>things? <a name="1228"></a><br>
I agree. <a name="1229"></a><br>
Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for <a name="1230"></a>example, to superintend and
command and deliberate and the like. Are not <a name="1231"></a>these functions proper to the soul, and can they
rightly be assigned to <a name="1232"></a>any other? <a name="1233"></a><br>
<br>
To no other. <a name="1234"></a><br>
And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the <a name="1235"></a>soul? <a name="1236"></a><br>
Assuredly, he said. <a name="1237"></a><br>
And has not the soul an excellence also? <a name="1238"></a><br>
Yes. <a name="1239"></a><br>
And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that <a name="1240"></a>excellence? <a name="1241"></a><br>
<br>
She cannot. <a name="1242"></a><br>
Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent, <a name="1243"></a>and the good soul a good
ruler? <a name="1244"></a><br>
<br>
Yes, necessarily. <a name="1245"></a><br>
And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and <a name="1246"></a>injustice the defect of the
soul? <a name="1247"></a><br>
<br>
That has been admitted. <a name="1248"></a><br>
Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust <a name="1249"></a>man will live ill? <a name="1250"></a><br>
<br>
That is what your argument proves. <a name="1251"></a><br>
And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the <a name="1252"></a>reverse of happy? <a name="1253"></a><br>
<br>
Certainly. <a name="1254"></a><br>
Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable? <a name="1255"></a><br>
So be it. <a name="1256"></a><br>
But happiness and not misery is profitable. <a name="1257"></a><br>
Of course. <a name="1258"></a><br>
Then, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable <a name="1259"></a>than justice. <a name="1260"></a><br>
<br>
Let this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the <a name="1261"></a>Bendidea. <a name="1262"></a><br>
For which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle <a name="1263"></a>towards me and have left
off scolding. Nevertheless, I have not been well <a name="1264"></a>entertained; but that was my own fault and not
yours. As an epicure snatches <a name="1265"></a>a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table, he not
having <a name="1266"></a>allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so have I gone from one subject <a name="1267"></a>to another
without having discovered what I sought at first, the nature <a name="1268"></a>of justice. I left that enquiry and
turned away to consider whether justice <a name="1269"></a>is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly; and when there
arose a further <a name="1270"></a>question about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice, I could <a name="1271"></a>not
refrain from passing on to that. And the result of the whole discussion <a name="1272"></a>has been that I know
nothing at all. For I know not what justice is, and <a name="1273"></a>therefore I am not likely to know whether it is
or is not a virtue, nor <a name="1274"></a>can I say whether the just man is happy or unhappy. <a name="end"></a></span></p>
