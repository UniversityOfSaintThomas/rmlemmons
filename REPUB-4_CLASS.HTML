<blockquote>
<center>Translated by Benjamin Jowett</center>
&nbsp;

<p>.... SOCRATES&nbsp;<a NAME="11"></a>
<br>And so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed&nbsp;<a NAME="984"></a>that
the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the individual,&nbsp;<a NAME="985"></a>and
that they are three in number.&nbsp;<a NAME="986"></a>

<p>Exactly.&nbsp;<a NAME="987"></a>
<br>Must we no
t then infer that the individual is wise in the same way,&nbsp;<a NAME="988"></a>and
in virtue of the same quality which makes the State&nbsp;<a NAME="989"></a>wise?&nbsp;<a NAME="990"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="991"></a>
<br>Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State constitutes&nbsp;<a NAME="992"></a>courage
in the individual, and that both the State and the individual bear&nbsp;<a NAME="993"></a>the
same relation to all the other virtues?&nbsp;<a NAME="994"></a>

<p>
Assuredly.&nbsp;<a NAME="995"></a>
<br>And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same&nbsp;<a NAME="996"></a>way
in which the State is just?&nbsp;<a NAME="997"></a>

<p>That follows, of course.&nbsp;<a NAME="998"></a>
<br>We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each&nbsp;<a NAME="999"></a>of
the three classes doing the work of its own class?&nbsp;<a NAME="1000"></a>

<p>We are not very likely to have forgotten, he&nbsp;<a NAME="1001"></a>said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1002"></a>
<br>We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities&nbsp;<a NAME="1003"></a>of
his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own&nbsp;<a NAME="1004"></a>work?&nbsp;<a NAME="1005"></a>

<p>Yes, he said, we must remember that too.&nbsp;<a NAME="1006"></a>
<br>And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care&nbsp;<a NAME="1007"></a>of
the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to&nbsp;<a NAME="1008"></a>be
the 
subject and ally?&nbsp;<a NAME="1009"></a>

<p>Certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="1010"></a>
<br>And, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic&nbsp;<a NAME="1011"></a>will
bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble&nbsp;<a NAME="1012"></a>words
and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness&nbsp;<a NAME="1013"></a>of
passion by harmony and rhythm?&nbsp;<a NAME="1014"></a>

<p>Quite true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1015"></a>
<br>And these two,
 thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly&nbsp;<a NAME="1016"></a>to
know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in&nbsp;<a NAME="1017"></a>each
of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable&nbsp;<a NAME="1018"></a>of
gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong&nbsp;<a NAME="1019"></a>with
the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the concupiscent&nbsp;<a NAME="1020"></a>soul,
no longer confined to her own sphere,
 should attempt to enslave and&nbsp;<a NAME="1021"></a>rule
those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn the whole&nbsp;<a NAME="1022"></a>life
of man?&nbsp;<a NAME="1023"></a>

<p>Very true, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1024"></a>
<br>Both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul&nbsp;<a NAME="1025"></a>and
the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and&nbsp;<a NAME="1026"></a>the
other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his comm
ands&nbsp;<a NAME="1027"></a>and
counsels?&nbsp;<a NAME="1028"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="1029"></a>
<br>And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure&nbsp;<a NAME="1030"></a>and
in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to&nbsp;<a NAME="1031"></a>fear?&nbsp;<a NAME="1032"></a>

<p>Right, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="1033"></a>
<br>And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and&nbsp;<a NAME="1034"></a>which
proclaims these commands; t
hat part too being supposed to have a&nbsp;<a NAME="1035"></a>knowledge
of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of&nbsp;<a NAME="1036"></a>the
whole?&nbsp;<a NAME="1037"></a>

<p>Assuredly.&nbsp;<a NAME="1038"></a>
<br>And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements&nbsp;<a NAME="1039"></a>in
friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the&nbsp;<a NAME="1040"></a>two
subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought&amp;nbsp;<a NAME="1041"></a>to
rule, and do not rebel?&nbsp;<a NAME="1042"></a>

<p>Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether&nbsp;<a NAME="1043"></a>in
the State or individual.&nbsp;<a NAME="1044"></a>

<p>And surely, I said, we have explained again and again how and by&nbsp;<a NAME="1045"></a>virtue
of what quality a man will be just.&nbsp;<a NAME="1046"></a>

<p>That is very certain.&nbsp;<a NAME="1047"></a>
<br>And is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form diffe
rent,&nbsp;<a NAME="1048"></a>or
is she the same which we found her to be in the State?&nbsp;<a NAME="1049"></a>

<p>There is no difference in my opinion, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1050"></a>
<br>Because, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few commonplace&nbsp;<a NAME="1051"></a>instances
will satisfy us of the truth of what I am&nbsp;<a NAME="1052"></a>saying.&nbsp;<a NAME="1053"></a>

<p>What sort of instances do you mean?&nbsp;<a NAME="1054"></a>
<br>If the case is put to us, must we no
t admit that the just State, or&nbsp;<a NAME="1055"></a>the
man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less&nbsp;<a NAME="1056"></a>likely
than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver? Would&nbsp;<a NAME="1057"></a>any
one deny this?&nbsp;<a NAME="1058"></a>

<p>No one, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="1059"></a>
<br>Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft,&nbsp;<a NAME="1060"></a>or
treachery either to his friends or to his country?&nbsp;<a NAME="1061"></a>

<p>Never.&nbsp;<a NAME="1062"></a>
<br>Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or&nbsp;<a NAME="1063"></a>agreements?&nbsp;<a NAME="1064"></a>

<p>Impossible.&nbsp;<a NAME="1065"></a>
<br>No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his&nbsp;<a NAME="1066"></a>father
and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?&nbsp;<a NAME="1067"></a>

<p>No one.&nbsp;<a NAME="1068"></a>
<br>And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,&amp;nbsp;<a NAME="1069"></a>whether
in ruling or being ruled?&nbsp;<a NAME="1070"></a>

<p>Exactly so.&nbsp;<a NAME="1071"></a>
<br>Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such&nbsp;<a NAME="1072"></a>states
is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?&nbsp;<a NAME="1073"></a>

<p>Not I, indeed.&nbsp;<a NAME="1074"></a>
<br>Then our dream has been realised; and the suspicion which we entertained&nbsp;<a NAME="1075"></a>at
the beginning of our work of construction, that so
me divine power must&nbsp;<a NAME="1076"></a>have
conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been&nbsp;<a NAME="1077"></a>verified?&nbsp;<a NAME="1078"></a>

<p>Yes, certainly.&nbsp;<a NAME="1079"></a>
<br>And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker&nbsp;<a NAME="1080"></a>and
the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not&nbsp;<a NAME="1081"></a>another's,
was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was of&nbsp;<a NAME="1082"></a>use?&amp;nbs
p;<a NAME="1083"></a>

<p>Clearly.&nbsp;<a NAME="1084"></a>
<br>But in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned&nbsp;<a NAME="1085"></a>however,
not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the true&nbsp;<a NAME="1086"></a>self
and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit the several&nbsp;<a NAME="1087"></a>elements
within him to interfere with one another, or any of them to do&nbsp;<a NAME="1088"></a>the
work of others, --he sets in order his own inner l
ife, and is his own&nbsp;<a NAME="1089"></a>master
and his own law, and at peace with himself; and when he has bound&nbsp;<a NAME="1090"></a>together
the three principles within him, which may be compared to the&nbsp;<a NAME="1091"></a>higher,
lower, and middle notes of the scale, and the intermediate intervals&nbsp;<a NAME="1092"></a>--when
he has bound all these together, and is no longer many, but has&nbsp;<a NAME="1093"></a>become
one entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature, then he procee
ds&nbsp;<a NAME="1094"></a>to
act, if he has to act, whether in a matter of property, or in the treatment&nbsp;<a NAME="1095"></a>of
the body, or in some affair of politics or private business; always&nbsp;<a NAME="1096"></a>thinking
and calling that which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious&nbsp;<a NAME="1097"></a>condition,
just and good action, and the knowledge which presides over&nbsp;<a NAME="1098"></a>it,
wisdom, and that which at any time impairs this condition, he will&nbsp;<a NAME="1099"></a>call
unjust action, and the opinion which presides over it&nbsp;<a NAME="1100"></a>ignorance.&nbsp;<a NAME="1101"></a>

<p>You have said the exact truth, Socrates.&nbsp;<a NAME="1102"></a>
<br>Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just&nbsp;<a NAME="1103"></a>man
and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should&nbsp;<a NAME="1104"></a>not
be telling a falsehood?&nbsp;<a NAME="1105"></a>

<p>Most certainly not.&nbsp;<a NAME="1106"></a>
<br>
May we say so, then?&nbsp;<a NAME="1107"></a>
<br>Let us say so.&nbsp;<a NAME="1108"></a>
<br>And now, I said, injustice has to be considered.&nbsp;<a NAME="1109"></a>
<br>Clearly.&nbsp;<a NAME="1110"></a>
<br>Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles&nbsp;<a NAME="1111"></a>--a
meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the soul&nbsp;<a NAME="1112"></a>against
the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is made by&nbsp;<a NAME="1113"></a>a
rebe
llious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the natural vassal,&nbsp;<a NAME="1114"></a>--what
is all this confusion and delusion but injustice, and intemperance&nbsp;<a NAME="1115"></a>and
cowardice and ignorance, and every form of vice?&nbsp;<a NAME="1116"></a>

<p>Exactly so.&nbsp;<a NAME="1117"></a>
<br>And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning&nbsp;<a NAME="1118"></a>of
acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will&nbsp;<a NAME="1119"></a>
also
be perfectly clear?&nbsp;<a NAME="1120"></a>

<p>What do you mean? he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1121"></a>
<br>Why, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just&nbsp;<a NAME="1122"></a>what
disease and health are in the body.&nbsp;<a NAME="1123"></a>

<p>How so? he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1124"></a>
<br>Why, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is&nbsp;<a NAME="1125"></a>unhealthy
causes disease.&nbsp;<a NAME="1126"></a>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a NAME="1127"></a>
<br>And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause&nbsp;<a NAME="1128"></a>injustice?&nbsp;<a NAME="1129"></a>
<br>That is certain.&nbsp;<a NAME="1130"></a>
<br>And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and&nbsp;<a NAME="1131"></a>government
of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation&nbsp;<a NAME="1132"></a>of
disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this&nbsp;<a NAME="1133"></a>natural
order?&nbsp;<a NAME="1134"></a>

<p>True.&amp;nb
sp;<a NAME="1135"></a>
<br>And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order&nbsp;<a NAME="1136"></a>and
government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation&nbsp;<a NAME="1137"></a>of
injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural&nbsp;<a NAME="1138"></a>order?&nbsp;<a NAME="1139"></a>

<p>Exactly so, he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1140"></a>
<br>Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and&nbsp;<a NAME="1141"></a>vice

the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?&nbsp;<a NAME="1142"></a>

<p>True.&nbsp;<a NAME="1143"></a>
<br>And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to&nbsp;<a NAME="1144"></a>vice?&nbsp;<a NAME="1145"></a>

<p>Assuredly.&nbsp;<a NAME="1146"></a>
<br>Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and&nbsp;<a NAME="1147"></a>injustice
has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to be just&nbsp;<a NAME="1148"></a>and
act justly and practise virtue
, whether seen or unseen of gods and&nbsp;<a NAME="1149"></a>men,
or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and&nbsp;<a NAME="1150"></a>unreformed?&nbsp;<a NAME="1151"></a>

<p>In my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous.&nbsp;<a NAME="1152"></a>We
know that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer endurable,&nbsp;<a NAME="1153"></a>though
pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and having all wealth&nbsp;<a NAME="1154"></a>and
all power; and shall 
we be told that when the very essence of the vital&nbsp;<a NAME="1155"></a>principle
is undermined and corrupted, life is still worth having to a&nbsp;<a NAME="1156"></a>man,
if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception&nbsp;<a NAME="1157"></a>that
he is not to acquire justice and virtue, or to escape from injustice&nbsp;<a NAME="1158"></a>and
vice; assuming them both to be such as we have described?&nbsp;<a NAME="1159"></a>

<p>Yes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridi
culous. Still, as&nbsp;<a NAME="1160"></a>we
are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner&nbsp;<a NAME="1161"></a>with
our own eyes, let us not faint by the way.&nbsp;<a NAME="1162"></a>

<p>Certainly not, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="1163"></a>
<br>Come up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, those&nbsp;<a NAME="1164"></a>of
them, I mean, which are worth looking at.&nbsp;<a NAME="1165"></a>

<p>I am following you, he replied: proceed.&nbsp;<a NAME="1166"></a>

<br>I said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as&nbsp;<a NAME="1167"></a>from
some tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue&nbsp;<a NAME="1168"></a>is
one, but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four special&nbsp;<a NAME="1169"></a>ones
which are deserving of note.&nbsp;<a NAME="1170"></a>

<p>What do you mean? he said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1171"></a>
<br>I mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul&nbsp;<a NAME="1172"></a>
as
there are distinct forms of the State.&nbsp;<a NAME="1173"></a>

<p>How many?&nbsp;<a NAME="1174"></a>
<br>There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I&nbsp;<a NAME="1175"></a>said.&nbsp;<a NAME="1176"></a>
<br>What are they?&nbsp;<a NAME="1177"></a>
<br>The first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which&nbsp;<a NAME="1178"></a>may
be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as&nbsp;<a NAME="1179"></a>rule
is exercised by one distinguished man or by m
any.&nbsp;<a NAME="1180"></a>

<p>True, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="1181"></a>
<br>But I regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether&nbsp;<a NAME="1182"></a>the
government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been&nbsp;<a NAME="1183"></a>trained
in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of the&nbsp;<a NAME="1184"></a>State
will be maintained.&nbsp;<a NAME="1185"></a>

<p>That is true, he replied.&nbsp;<a NAME="end"></a></blockquote>
