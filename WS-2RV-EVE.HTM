<P>Argument Worksheet #2</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Read the following passages; symbolize the arguments; and answer the questions:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(1) Animals lack judgment and consciousness. (2) If they did not lack judgment and
consciousness, then they would not have species specific activities (activities specific to a
species, e.g. all untrained dogs chase running cats).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>A: What is the overall conclusion of this passage?</P>

<P>B: Outline/symbolize the argument and write out the missing claim. [Arguments require
three claims.] </P>

<P>C: Is the passage's argument a <EM>modus ponens or tollens</EM>? Valid or invalid?</P>

<P>D: Which premise is the one most likely to be attacked? </P>

<P>E: Which philosopher(s) would attack the claim identified in (D)? </P>

<P>F: Which philosopher(s) whom we have studied would defend the claim of D?</P>

<P>G: Are there any arguments to defend or attack the overall conclusion? Who would offer
such arguments?</P>

<P>		</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(1) If one can imagine a computer with human emotions and the awareness of being a mortal
self, then it is possible to make such computers exist. (2) It is possible to imagine a computer
with human emotions and the awareness of being a mortal self. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>A: Write out, as claim (3), the overall conclusion of this passage.</P>

<P>B: Is the passage's argument valid?</P>

<P>C: Which claim is the one most likely to be attacked? By whom?</P>

<P>D: Which philosopher(s) whom we have studied would defend the claim of C?</P>

<P>E: Are there any arguments to defend or attack the overall conclusion? Who would offer
such arguments? </P>

<P>		</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(1) The ability to imagine a computer with human emotions and the awareness of being a mortal
self does not prove that it is possible for such a computer to exist, (2) since human beings have
the ability to imagine many things that cannot possibly exist. (3) If human beings lacked the
ability to imagine things that cannot possibly exist, then human beings could have never
imagined grasshoppers the size of football fields or mountains made of chocolate or talking
rocks. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>A: What is the overall conclusion of this passage?</P>

<P>B: What fact is this argument asking the reader to supply? Write out that fact as the missing
premise (4):</P>

<P>C: Write out---as missing premise (5)---the conditional premise that connects with claim (2)
in a <EM>modus</EM> <EM>ponens</EM> argument to prove claim (1): </P>

<P>(5): </P>

<P>D: Is the passage's argument valid?</P>

<P>E: Which claim is the one most likely to be attacked? By whom?</P>

<P>F: Which philosopher(s) would attack the claim identified in (E)? </P>

<P>G: Which philosopher(s) whom we have studied would defend the claim of E?</P>

<P>H: Are there any arguments to defend or attack the overall conclusion? Who would offer
such arguments?</P>

<P>(1) If the mind is related to the body as harmony is related to the lyre, then the mind is
unable to do or understand anything that cannot be understood by the body. (2) If the
mind's understanding of justice and goodness cannot be translated into singular and
physical terms, then justice and goodness cannot be understood by the body.  (3) Justice
and goodness cannot be understood in singular and physical terms.  Thus, (4) since the
mind is able to understand some thing that cannot be understood by the body, (e.g. justice
and goodness), (5) the mind is not related to the body as harmony is related to the lyre. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>A: What is the overall conclusion of this passage?</P>

<P>B: What are the two premises linking together the subject and the predicate of the overall
conclusion?</P>

<P>C: Claim (1) connects with which claim (   ) to give which conclusion (   )?</P>

<P>D: Which claim provides the key evidence for the overall conclusion?</P>

<P>E: What is the relationship between claims 2, 3, and 4? <EM>Modus tollens, modus ponens or
disjuntive argument?  Valid or invalid?</EM></P>

<P>F: Which claim is the one most likely to be attacked? By whom?</P>

<P>G: Which philosopher(s) would attack the claim identified in (F)? </P>

<P>H: Which philosopher(s) whom we have studied would defend the claim of F?</P>

<P>I: Are there any arguments to defend or attack the overall conclusion? Who would offer
such arguments?<EM></EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(1) If the Chinese Room shows that computers cannot learn semantics from syntax, then it is
impossible for computers to be able to understand in a human way. (2) Computers do
understand in a human way, (3) because human beings who did nothing but calculations were
once called computers. (4) If human beings can think like computers, then computers can
understand in a human way.  Thus, (5) although computers cannot learn semantics from syntax,
(6) they can still understand in a human way.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>A: What is the overall conclusion of this passage?</P>

<P>B: Claim (2) is supported by premises (3) and (4) combining together in a <EM>modus ponens or
modus tollens</EM>?</P>

<P>C: Reflect upon the relationship of (5) and the conclusion. Claim (5) repeats the antecedent
of claim (1) even though the conclusion of this passage denies the consequent of claim (1).
This passage is arguing that while the antecedent of (1) is true, it is still possible for
computers to understand in a human way; this means that this passage is arguing that
claim (1) is false. </P>

<P>D: Is the passage's argument valid? Notice that this passage turns on a term being
understood in two different ways:  "understanding in a human way" in claim 1 means being
able to understand semantics; "understanding in a human way" in claim 2 means being able
to do complex calculations. Do you think that these differences are sufficiently significant
so as to affect the validity of this argument?  If so, then you think that the author of this
passage is guilty of equivocation. The fallacy of equivocation means giving terms
significantly different meanings.</P>

<P>E: Which claim is the one most likely to be attacked? By whom?</P>

<P>F: Which philosopher(s) would attack the claim identified in (E)? </P>

<P>G: Which philosopher(s) whom we have studied would defend the claim of E?</P>

<P>H: Are there any arguments to defend or attack the overall conclusion? Who would offer
such arguments?</P>
